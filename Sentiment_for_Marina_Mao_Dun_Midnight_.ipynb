              "'THE sun had just sunk below the horizon and a gentle breeze\\ncaressed one’s face. The muddy water of Soochow Creek, trans-\\nformed to a golden green, flowed quietly westward. The eve-\\nning tide from the Whangpoo had turned imperceptibly, and now\\nthe assortment of boats along both sides of the creek were riding\\nhigh, their decks some six inches above the landing-stages. Faint\\nstrains of music were borne on the wind from the park across\\nthe river, punctuated by the sharp, cheerful patter of kettle-\\ndrums. Under a sunset-mottled sky, the towering framework\\nof Garden Bridge was mantled in a gathering mist. Whenever\\na tram passed over the bridge, the overhead cable suspended\\nbelow the top of the steel frame threw off bright, greenish\\nsparks. Looking east, one could see the warehouses on the\\nwaterfront of Pootung like huge monsters crouching in the gloom,\\ntheir lights twinkling like countless tiny eyes. To the west,\\none saw with a shock of wonder on the roof of a building a\\ngigantic neon sign in flaming red and phosphorescent green:\\nLIGHT, HEAT, POWER.\\n\\nIt was a perfect May evening. Three 1930-model Citroens\\nflashed over the bridge, turned westward, and headed straight\\nalong the North Soochow Road. Passing a block west of the\\nShanghai Chamber of Commerce Building on the corner of\\nNorth Honan Road, where the creek below was usually thronged\\nwith steam-launches plying upriver, the three cars slowed down.\\nThe driver of the first car said in a low voice to the hulking\\nfellow sitting beside him in black silk:\\n\\n“The Tai Sheng Chang Company, isn’t it, Kuan?”\\n\\n“Of course it is,’ replied his companion, also in a low voice.\\n“Surely you haven\\'t forgotten already? That bitch must be mak-\\ning you soft in the head.”\\nAs the bodyguard, for such he was, spoke, he showed large,\\nstrong teeth. The car jarred to a stop and Kuan quickly\\nscrambied out, placing his hand on the Browning at his side\\nas he did so and glancing all round. Then he went round and\\nopened the other door and stood holding it, looking stern and\\nforbidding. A head stuck out cautiously—-a square, pimply,\\npurplish face with thick eyebrows and round eyes. Spotting the\\nsignboard over the gate with the name “The Tai Sheng Chang\\nShipping Company,” the man emerged completely and quickly\\nmade for the building with his bodyguard close behind him.\\n\\n“Is the Flying Cloud arriving soon?” the purplish-faced man\\nasked in a loud and arrogant voice. About forty, powerfully built\\nand imposing, he struck you at once as a solid and prosperous\\nbusinessman, accustomed to giving orders. Before the words\\nwere out of his mouth, the clerks sitting there in the office\\njumped up as one man, and a tall, thin young man, smiling\\nbroadly, stepped forward.\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Wu, very soon,” he answered respectfully. “Please\\ntake a seat.” He turned to a boy: “Go and get some tea.”\\n\\nWhile he was speaking he drew up a chair and placed it\\nbehind the visitor, whose fleshy face twitched in what could\\nhave been a smile as he glanced at the young man, and then\\nlooked out towards the street. By now the visitor’s car had\\nmoved on to make room for the second, out of which a man\\nand a woman appeared and came into the hall. The man was\\nshort and stoutish with a bland and pallid face, while the woman\\nwas much taller, and bore a certain resemblance to the other\\nman with her square face, although her skin was smooth and\\nfair. Both she and her husband were in their forties, but in\\nher fashionable dress she did not look more than thirty. The\\nhusband greeted the first arrival:\\n\\n“why, hello, Sun-fu! Are we all waiting here?”\\n\\nBefore the purplish-faced man could answer, the spindly youth\\nquickly chimed in with a broad smile:\\n\\n“Yes, here, Mr. Tu. I’ve just heard her hooter and sent some-\\none to keep a look-out at the landing-stage. He’ll run back as\\nsoon as the boat arrives. I don’t think we’ll have to wait more\\nthan five minutes. Only five more minutes.”\\n“Ah, Fu Sheng! I’m very glad to see you\\'re still here. Yes,\\nthe best way to learn a trade is to stick to it. Father has often\\nsaid you’re very keen. How long is it since you saw the old man\\nlast?”\\n\\n“T paid a visit to Old Mr. Wu only a month ago while I was\\nhome on leave,” babbled the spindly youth Fu Sheng in reply,\\ndazzled by Mrs. Tu’s compliments; then, placing a chair behind\\nher and another behind her husband, he begged her to take a\\nseat.\\n\\nThen he bustled about serving tea and offering cigarettes round.\\nThis young man was the son of an old servant of the Wu family.\\nHe had always been a nimble-witted lad, so Old Mr. Wu had\\nasked his son Sun-fu to put him in this shipping office as an\\nemployee. The two men and the woman remained standing,\\nlooking every now and then towards the entrance. There at the\\ngate another hefty fellow was standing with his back to the\\ndoor, looking vigilantly right and left —- Mr. Tu’s bodyguard.\\n\\nMrs. Tu sat down first with a sigh of relief. She dabbed her\\nlips with a print silk handkerchief, then said over her shoulder\\nto Mr. Wu:\\n\\n“When I went home with Chu-chai last year to visit the an-\\ncestral graves, we travelled on this same Flying Cloud. It’s a\\nfast boat and didn’t stop on the way, and we did the journey in\\nhalf a day, but it did roll terribly, and made my joints ache.\\nI’m sure father must be having an awful time of it today. Of\\ncourse, being paralysed like that, he can hardly move a muscle.”\\nShe turned to her husband: “Chu-chai, do you remember how\\nfather complained of feeling giddy last year when he had been\\nsitting down too long... ?”\\n\\nMrs. Tu paused and sighed slightly, her eyes reddening at the\\nedges. She was going to say something more when a steam-\\nwhistle screeched, and a boy dashed in announcing excitedly:\\n\\n“The boat’s drawing level with the landing-stage!”\\n\\nMrs. Tu instantly rose, laying a hand on Mr. Tu’s shoulder.\\nFu Sheng dashed out, at the same time looking back to say:\\n\\n“Mr. Wu, Mr. Tu, Mrs. Tu, there’s no need to hurry. Wait till\\nI’ve seen to things before you come out.”\\n\\nAll the clerks in the office began to bustle about. Somebody\\nsummoned two stout porters who had been standing by, and\\n\\nwho immediately ran in, took up a cane-chair, and carried it\\noff. Wu Sun-fu, looking out on the street, said to Mrs. Tu:\\n\\n“On our way home you’ll sit with father in the first car —\\nNo. 1889. I\\'ll keep Huei-fang company in the second, and Chu-\\nchai’ll have Ah-hsuan in the third.”\\n\\nMrs. Tu nodded and looked towards the entrance, moving her\\nlips as she silently recited Buddhist sutras. A cigar in his\\nmouth and a smile on his lips, Tu Chu-chai glanced at Wu Sun-\\nfu as much as to say: Let’s go now. Just then Fu Sheng came\\nback frowning with annoyance.\\n\\n“What a nuisance!” he said. “There is a Soochow Line tug\\noccupying the landing-stage.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t matter: let’s go and see,” Wu Sun-fu inter-\\nrupted and made off with his bodyguard. Tu Chu-chai and\\nhis wife followed; Fu Sheng and the other bodyguard, who had\\nbeen standing at the door, brought up the rear.\\n\\nThe Flying Cloud was moored alongside a tug, commonly\\nknown as a “company boat.” The large cane-chair was placed\\nin readiness on the foredeck, the two bearers waiting on either\\nside. Along the wharf there was not the usual bustle and din.\\nOn the landing-stage several men from the shipping company\\nwere shouting and trying to shoo off the rickshawmen and\\nhawkers, who kept pushing forward. While Wu Sun-fu and\\nthe Tu couple were picking their way across the deck of the\\ntug, a cabin boy helped Old Mr. Wu out on deck and sat him\\ndown in the cane-chair. Fu Sheng ran up and made signs to\\nthe bearers to hoist up the old man and carry him carefully on\\nto the “company boat.” The old man was met by his son,\\ndaughter, and son-in-law, who were relieved to find him none\\nthe worse for the voyage, except for red blotches on his temples.\\nBut he did not speak; he merely glanced at them, nodded his\\nhead slightly, and closed his eyes.\\n\\nHuei-fang, the old man’s fourth daughter, and Ah-hsuan, his\\nseventh son, also came aboard the tug from the Flying Cloud.\\n\\n“How did father feel on the journey, Huei-fang?’ Mrs. Tu\\nasked her younger sister in a whisper.\\n\\n“Pretty well, though he kept saying that he felt giddy.”\\n“Let\\'s hurry up and get to the cars,” said Wu Sun-fu impa-\\ntiently. “Fu Sheng, go and tell the chauffeur to bring the new\\ncar round first.”\\n\\nLeaving the old gentleman in the care of the ladies, Wu Sun-\\nfu, Tu Chu-chai, and the lad Ah-hsuan went ashore first. The\\nnew car drove up, while the bearers landed the cane-chair with\\nits occupant. They got the old man settled in the car, and Mrs.\\nTu took her place beside him. Her perfume seemed to wake\\nhim, and he opened his eyes to see who it was and said in a\\nslow and quavering voice:\\n\\n“Is that you, Fu-fang? I also want Huei-fang to come with\\nme—and Ah-hsuan as well.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu, who was in the second car, heard this and frowned\\nslightly, but said nothing. He knew how eccentric and obstinate\\nhis father was—so did Chu-chai. So Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan\\nsqueezed into the car beside their father. Fu-fang, who couldn\\'t\\nbear to leave her father, remained where she was, so that the\\nold man was now sandwiched between his two daughters. The\\nengine started up but as the car moved forward the old man\\nsuddenly cried in a shrill voice:\\n\\n“The Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments.’*\\n\\nIt was a strange, strident cry —a flare of light in an old\\nflickering life. His old eyes gleamed, the faint reddish patches\\non his temples turned a deep red, and his lips trembled.\\n\\nThe driver immediately braked and cast a startled glance\\nover his shoulder. The other two cars also stopped. Nobody\\nknew what had happened. Only Huei-fang understood what it\\nwas her father wanted. Fu Sheng had come up, and she told\\nhim:\\n\\n“Fu Sheng, run back to the cabin and look for a book in a\\nyellow damask-covered case.”\\n\\nTwenty-five years before Old Mr. Wu had had a fall from a\\nhorse, and an injury to his leg had led to partial paralysis. He\\nhad since developed a strong faith in the religious book on virtue\\nrewarded and vice punished. Every year he had given free copies\\nof the book to fellow-believers as a practice of virtue. He had\\nalso copied the whole book in his own neat and pious hand, and\\n\\n* An ancient book based on the belief in divine retribution.\\n\\nthis transcript had become for him a talisman against vice, with\\nwhich he could never part for a moment.\\n\\nVery soon Fu Sheng was back with the book. Old Mr. Wu\\ntook it and laid it reverently on his lap. He closed his eyes\\nagain, a faint smile of peace on his shrivelled lips.\\n\\n“Carry on now, driver,” Mrs. Tu ordered quietly. With a sigh\\nof relief, she sank back into her seat and rested her head against\\nthe cushioned back, smiling with satisfaction. The cars were\\ngathering speed, turning east along the North Soochow Road,\\ncrossing Hongkew Bridge, turning south, then racing along at\\nhalf a mile a minute, the record speed for the 1930 model.\\n\\n*\\n\\nIt is one of life’s little ironies that someone should be driving\\nthrough the wide streets of Shanghai—that great city of the\\nEast with a population of three million—in such a modern con-\\nveyance as a motorcar, yet holding the Supreme Scriptures in\\nhis hands, his mind intent upon one text: “Of all the vices\\nsexual indulgence is the cardinal; of all the virtues filial picty\\nis the supreme.” In the case of Old Mr. Wu, the irony was all\\nthe more remarkable because he genuinely believed in the\\nSupreme Scriptures, unlike those “virtuous fellows” of Shanghai\\nwho swindle money out of the public under the cloak of religion.\\nThirty years back, Old Mr. Wu had been a member of a political\\nparty which had agitated for reforms. In spite of the fact that\\nhis father and grandfather had been high-ranking officials enjoy-\\ning the Emperor’s generosity in no small degree, he was full\\nof the revolutionary ideas of the time, and as a young man had\\nbeen a leading light in the universal conflict between fathers and\\nsons of those days. He would probably not now be buried all\\nday in his Supreme Scriptures but for the fact that he had fallen\\nfrom his horse in a cavalry exercise and received an injury to\\nhis leg which had since brought on paralysis. Soon afterwards\\nhe suffered a further blow in the death of his wife. He lost all\\nhis youthful vigour, which seemed to have run out of him when\\nhe fell off his horse. For twenty-five years he had not set foot\\noutside his study, had not read anything except the Book of\\nRewards and Punishments, nor had anything to do with the\\nworld outside. The conflict between father and son had now\\nbecome an inescapable reality for him and his son Sun-fu, and\\nhe now seemed as cantankerous and eccentric to his son as his\\nfather had once seemed to him. His study had been his castle;\\nhis scriptures his coat of mail. For ten years he had stubbornly\\nrefused to make peace with his son.\\n\\nNow, although he was riding in a motorcar of the latest design,\\nit did not mean that he was relenting towards his son. On the\\ncontrary, he had repeatedly declared that he would rather die\\nthan see his son living a life completely deviating from the path\\nof righteousness. He had never really wanted to come to Shang-\\nhai, nor had his son tried to insist that he should. Lately, how-\\never, local bandits had been very active and in the neighbouring\\nprovince the Reds had been gaining ground like a prairie fire.\\nWu Sun-fu had thought it no longer safe for his father to remain\\nin his country home. It was, in fact, an expression of filial\\npiety. It had never occurred to the old man that bandits or\\nReds would harm a pious old man like him, but invalid as he\\nwas, unable to move and unable to sit up or lie down without\\nhelp, what else could he do but let them haul him out of his\\ncastle, load him on board a boat, and finally thrust him into\\nthis monster of a motorcar. Just as, twenty-five years ago,\\nhis paralysis had ended his career as a reformist and forced him\\nto surrender to his vice-minister father, so now this same ac-\\ncursed infirmity was threatening to cut short his religious life\\nand force him to stoop to his modern industrialist son. Could\\nthere be no end to his tragedy?\\n\\nNevertheless, he still had his Book of Rewards and Punishments\\nto afford him its precious protection. He had also his two pre-\\ncious children, his son Ah-hsuan and his daughter Huei-fang,\\nto be at his side, so that although he was now plunging into\\nthe “sinners’ paradise” of Shanghai, he was strong in the belief\\nthat he could keep himself morally intact. He had closed his\\neyes long enough to regain his mental composure and now he\\nopened them calmly and confidently to look once more at the\\nworld.\\n\\nThe car was racing along like mad. He peered through the\\nwind-sereen. Good Heavens! the towering skyscrapers, their\\ncountless lighted windows gleaming like the eyes of devils,\\nseemed to be rushing down on him like an avalanche at one\\nmoment and vanishing at the next. The smooth road stretched\\nbefore him, and street-lamps flashed past on either side, spring-\\ning up and vanishing in endless succession. A snake-like stream\\nof black monsters, each with a pair of blinding lights for eyes,\\ntheir horns blaring, bore down upon him, nearer and nearer! He\\nclosed his eyes tight in terror, trembling all over. He felt as\\nif his head were spinning and his eyes swam before a kalei-\\ndoscope of red, yellow, green, black, shiny, square, cylindrical,\\nleaping, dancing shapes, while his ears rang in a pandemonium\\nof honking, hooting and jarring, till his heart was in his mouth.\\n\\nWhen some time had passed without mishap, the old man\\nslowly recovered his breath and became conscious of voices\\nhumming about his ears:\\n\\n“Shanghai is not so peaceful nowadays either, Huei-fang. Last\\nmonth the buses went on strike, and now the trams are out.\\nNot long ago there was a big Communist demonstration in\\nPeking Road. Hundreds of them were arrested, and one of them\\nwas shot dead on the spot. Some of the Communists were\\narmed, too! Sun-fu says the factory workers are restless and\\nmight make trouble or riot at any moment. And the walls of\\nhis factory and house have often had Communist slogans chalked\\nall over them... .”\\n\\n“Haven\\'t the police ever caught them?”\\n\\n“They have caught some, but they cannot catch all of them.\\nOh, dear! I really don’t know where all these desperate charac-\\nters come from. ... But my dear, you do make me laugh with\\nyour get-up. Your dress might have been in fashion ten years\\nago but now you\\'re in Shanghai you must follow the fashion.\\nYou must get yourself a new outfit first thing tomorrow morning.”\\n\\nOld Mr. Wu opened his eyes again and saw that he was sur-\\nrounded by a sea of little box-like motorcars like the one he\\nwas sitting in, all standing quiet and motionless, while not far\\nahead a stream of cars and vehicles of all kinds was rushing\\nhiggledy-piggledy in one direction and another stream the other\\nway. Among the cars men and women of all sorts and condi-\\ntions were dashing along as if the devil was on their tail. From\\nsomewhere above a shaft of crimson light fell upon him.\\n\\nHere, at the crossing of Nanking Road and Honan Road, the\\ncars going across were being held up by the traffic lights.\\n“T haven’t met Sun-fu’s wife yet, Fu-fang,” whispered Huei-\\nfang. “I’m afraid she’ll die laughing when she sees what a\\neountrified girl I am.”\\n\\nShe cast a furtive glance at her father, then gazed out at all\\nthe fashionable women sitting in the cars all round them. Fu-\\nfang giggled, and took out her handkerchief to dab her lips.\\nA whiff of perfume assailed the old fellow’s nostrils, and it\\nseemed to upset him.\\n\\n“YT really can’t get over you, Huei-fang. When I went home\\nto the country last year, I didn\\'t see any of the country girls\\nwearing such old-fashioned clothes as yours.”\\n\\n“That’s true. Even country girls like to look pretty and\\nsmart nowadays. But father won’t let me... .”\\n\\nAll this talk about fashion acted like a needle on the atrophied\\nnerves of the old man. His heart fluttered, and his eyes fell\\ninstinctively upon Fu-fang and he saw now for the first time\\nhow she was decked out. Though it was still only May, the\\nweather was unusually warm and she was already in the lightest\\nof summer clothing. Her vital young body was sheathed in\\nclose-fitting light-blue chiffon, her full, firm breasts jutting out\\nprominently, her snowy forearms bared. Old Mr. Wu felt his\\nheart constricting with disgust and quickly averted his eyes,\\nwhich, however, fell straight away upon a half-naked young\\nwoman sitting up in a rickshaw, fashionably dressed in a\\ntransparent, sleeveless voile blouse, displaying her bare legs and\\nthighs. The old man thought for one horrible moment that she\\nhad nothing else on. The text “Of all the vices sexual indul-\\ngence is the cardinal” drummed on his mind, and he shuddered.\\nBut the worst was yet to come, for he quickly withdrew his\\ngaze, only to find his youngest son Ah-hsuan gaping with avid\\nadmiration at the same half-naked young woman. The old man\\nfelt his heart pounding wildly as if it would burst, and his throat\\nburning as if choked with chillies.\\n\\nThe lights changed to green, and the car moved forward in a\\nmotley sea of traffic and humanity. On and on they went, while\\nthe din of the traffic, the stench of petrol-fumes, the women’s\\nperfume and the glare of neon signs pressed down like a night-\\nmare on his frail spirit until his eyes blurred, his ears sang and\\n\\nhis head swam; until his over-wrought nerves ached as if they\\nwould snap and his pounding heart could beat no faster.\\n\\nHis breathing became wheezy, but amid the roar of the metrop-\\nolis neither Fu-fang nor Huei-fang nor Ah-hsuan could hear\\nit. His face turned ashen, but in the red and green glare no-\\nbody noticed the difference.\\n\\nThe car raced on at top speed. Their lighted windows gleam-\\ning through the trees, the flats at the roadside rushed up one\\nafter another and were gone in a flash. The cool evening breeze\\nset the wind-screen rattling. NHuei-fang drew a sigh of relief as\\nif a great weight had been lifted from her mind and said to\\nAh-hsuan:\\n\\n“This time we’ve really come to stay in Shanghai, I suppose.\\nBut what is it that’s so attractive about Shanghai that people\\nkeep pouring in? If you ask me, I rather hate the bustle and\\nnoise. It gives me such a headache.”\\n\\n“You\\'ll like it when you get used to it,” said Fu-fang. “Every-\\npody’s running away from the countryside now that the bandits\\nare on the increase, and settling in Shanghai. Look at these\\nnew houses on either side of the road; they’ve sprung up during\\nthe last two years. No matter how many new houses are built,\\nthere are always people waiting to move in.”\\n\\nShe opened her red handbag, took out a powder-puff, and\\nbegan making up her face in the little mirror fixed inside the\\nbag:\\n\\n“TI think it’s quite peaceful in the country. Seems there are\\nless rumours of trouble there. Isn’t that so, Ah-hsuan?”\\n\\n“Peaceful? I can’t agree. Why, only two weeks ago a com-\\npany of troops arrived in our town and demanded that the\\nChamber of Commerce should supply them with fifty young\\nwomen—to darn and wash for them, they said. When the\\nChamber of Commerce said that they couldn’t help them, the\\nsoldiers set out themselves to find them. The fruiterer’s wife\\nnext door was grabbed, don’t you remember? And our maid\\ndidn’t dare set foot outside the house for several days... .”\\n\\n“But that’s outrageous! Of course, here in Shanghai we never\\nknow what\\'s actually happening down in the country. We have\\nheard that the Communists kidnap women and communize them.”\\n“But I’ve never seen a Communist in our parts. Anyway,\\nthat company of soldiers made enough trouble as it is.”\\n\\n“Oh, Ah-hsuan, what a fool you are!” said Fu-fang with a\\nsigh. “Of course you’ve never seen a Communist! If you had\\ndone, you wouldn\\'t be here now! Chu-chai says they’re up to\\nall sorts of tricks now. They’re everywhere. You\\'ll find them\\nin all walks of lite, and there’s no stopping them. And you\\ndon’t even know they’re there until they strike like a bolt from\\nthe blue.”\\n\\nHuei-fang shivered inwardly at this, but Ah-hsuan, who did\\nnot quite understand what it was all about, just threw back his\\nhead and laughed. He was immensely tickled by Fu-fang’s\\naccount of the elusive, will-o’-the-wisp Communists. He thought\\nto himself: So the Communists pounce on you like a bolt from\\nthe blue, do they? Why, that’s magic. He was the baby of the\\nfamily and, although now a good-looking lad of nineteen, he\\nwas still rather naive, having always been his father’s blue-\\neyed boy.\\n\\nThe chauffeur sounded the horn and the car turned into a\\nquiet, shady side-street, where the lamplight filtered through\\na dense screen of leaves and splashed Fu-fang and the others with\\nflecks of light. The car began to slow down as it approached\\nthe house. Gathering up her things, Fu-fang turned to her\\nfather and said quietly:\\n\\n“Father, we\\'re there.”\\n\\n“He’s asleep.”\\n\\n“Don\\'t shout so, Ah-hsuan. You know, Fu-fang, while father’s\\nresting with his eyes closed, he allows no one to disturb him.”\\n\\nThe chauffeur gave three blasts on the horn, holding on to\\ntoots, trailing the last one to announce their presence. The\\nblack iron gate in front of the big foreign-style building imme-\\ndiately swung open, and the car glided into the drive. Ah-hsuan\\njumped up from his seat and, looking round, saw that the other\\ntwo cars were following behind and that several servants and\\nan armed policeman were standing by the entrance. Then the\\niron gate clanged shut and the cars swished on up the asphalt\\ndrive, through a tunnel of dark, overhanging trees through which\\noccasional lights twinkled. The car swung sharply and there\\nin front of them was a large, brightly-lit, three-storeyed build-\\ning. The car lurched to a stop amid radio music which floated\\nthrough an open window.\\n\\nA maid’s clear voice announced:\\n\\n“Madame! Mr. Wu and his father and the others are here.’\\n\\nOld Mr. Wu, who had only just recovered from his attack of\\ndizziness, opened his eyes with a start of surprise. The first\\nthings that his returning consciousness seized upon were the\\nravenous way his son Ah-hsuan had gazed at the half-naked\\nwoman in the street and his daughter Huei-fang’s voice as she\\nhad complained: “Even country girls like to look pretty and\\nsmart nowadays, but father won’t let me... .”\\n\\nSo his precious children had undergone a change the moment\\nthey had entered the “Sinners’ Paradise”!\\n\\n*\\n\\nThe radio was switched off, and the sound of women’s laughter\\ncarried through the windows. Then a bustling clickety-clack\\nof high-heeled shoes was heard as three dark figures loomed up.\\nOne of them proved to be a tallish, svelte young woman in a\\npink dress. She hurried up to the first car, her hips swaying\\nas she walked, pulled open the door and greeted them gaily:\\n\\n“How did you enjoy your journey, father? Fu-fang, is this\\nHuei-fang? And Ah-hsuan?”\\n\\nOld Mr. Wu was immediately enveloped in an overpowering\\ngust of rich, heady perfume, and through the fragrant haze saw\\na round, clear-skinned face beneath an unruly mop of wavy hair,\\nwith bright, sparkling eyes, and startlingly red lips parted in\\na ready smile. She tilted her curly head slightly and said in\\na tinkling, silvery voice:\\n\\n“Sun-fu, you and the others go in first. Fu-fang and Pll help\\nfather out of the car. Huei-fang, will you get out first?”\\n\\nOld Mr. Wu summoned up his last ounce of strength to shake\\nhis head, but nobody noticed it. Huei-fang stepped out brush-\\ning against the wavy hair of the young lady. Fu-fang put her\\nright arm under the old man’s left arm to support him while\\nAh-hsuan also lent a hand. Thus he was propelled out of the\\ncar willy-nilly and passed to the wavy-haired lady, whose smooth\\narm immediately encircled his waist. In a swirl of enticing\\nlaughter and overwhelmingly fragrant scent, Old Mr. Wu could\\nonly shudder and clutch against his breast the Book of Rewards\\n\\nand Punishments. A thought flashed through his tortured mind:\\n“They must be demons or evil spirits, these people!”\\n\\nExtreme disgust and anger seemed to infuse the old man with\\nunwonted strength, which enabled him to mount the stone steps\\nquite easily on the arms of his daughter and daughter-in-law.\\nThe big drawing-room was flooded with light and filled with\\npeople. When Old Mr. Wu stepped into the room, he was met\\nby his son and son-in-law. Then two wavy-haired young girls\\nrushed up to him. They asked him how he was and, laughing\\nand chattering, hustled him into a high-backed armchair.\\n\\nThe old man looked around him, his wide eyes burning with\\ndisgust, anger and excitement, and his face purpling. He saw\\nthe room whirling with lights and colours, whirling more and\\nmore swiftly. Near by him a queer-looking, round and shiny\\nthing stood on a small table whirring and turning from side to\\nside, making a wind which took his breath away, like a golden-\\nfaced witch swaying her head and casting a spell over him. And\\nthe more this golden, flashing disc swayed, the bigger it became,\\nuntil it filled the whole room, until it filled all space. All the\\nred and green lights, all the geometrical shapes of the furniture\\nand all the men and women were dancing and spinning together,\\nbathed in the golden light. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu in pink, a girl in\\napple-green, and another in light yellow were frantically leaping\\nand whirling around him. Their light silk dresses barely con-\\ncealed their curves, their full, pink-tipped breasts and the shadow\\nunder their arms. The room was filled with countless swelling\\nbosoms, bosoms that bobbed and quivered and danced around\\nhim. Wu Sun-fu’s pimply face grinned and Ah-hsuan’s lustful\\neyes shone among the dancing breasts. Suddenly, all these\\nquivering, dancing breasts swept at Old Mr. Wu like a hail of\\narrows, piling up on his chest and smothering him, piling up on\\nthe Book of Rewards and Punishments on his lap. He heard\\nwild, seductive laughter and the room rocked and swayed as if\\nit would collapse.\\n\\n“Devils,” cried Old Mr. Wu, as golden sparks showered before\\nhis eyes. He felt his chest crushed under an enormous weight,\\nand something seemed to explode inside his head. Suddenly\\nthere sprang out of the ground before him two women, Mrs. Wu\\nSun-fu and the girl in apple-green, both laughing with wide-\\n\\nopen, blood-red mouths as though they wanted to swallow him.\\nSomething seemed to snap in his head. He turned up his eyes,\\nand knew no more.\\n\\n“Uncle, don’t you recognize me? I’m Su-su, Chang Su-su,’\\nthe girl in apple-green Grafton silk asked him and giggled, while\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu let out a startled scream and dropped the cup\\nof tea which she was holding out for the old man. All the\\nother people in the room started up in surprise. For a brief\\nmoment you could have heard a pin drop; then there was a\\nrush of feet, and they thronged round Old Mr. Wu, all shouting\\nand asking questions at once. He looked deathly pale, his head\\ndrooping to the side and his mouth frothing. The Book of\\nRewards and Punishments fell to the floor with a heavy thud.\\n\\n“Pather! What’s the matter with you? Wake up! Wake up!”\\ncried Mrs. Tu in a trembling voice, holding her father’s head in\\nher hands, while Tu Chu-chai, her husband, peered round her\\nshoulder, frightened out of his wits.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was gripping his father’s hand. When he saw\\nmany servants pressing round, he flared up:\\n\\n“Get out of the way, all of you. Hurry up and fetch an ice-\\nbag.”\\n\\n“An ice-bag! Get an ice-bag!” the servants shouted as they\\nscrambled out of the room to find one. “Old Mr. Wu\\'s having\\na stroke!’ The girl in light yellow grasped Chang Su-su’s hand\\nand asked:\\n\\n“Su-su, what happened? You saw the old man faint away,\\ndidn’t you?”\\n\\nChang Su-su stood speechless, her eyes staring and her chest\\nrising and falling. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu gasped:\\n\\n?\\n\\n“T was holding out a cup of tea for father ...I saw, I saw\\nhim ...saw his head drooping... his eyes closing ... his\\nmouth foaming... his face turning pale. Is it a stroke? Or\\n\\nasthma? Huei-fang, has father ever had attacks like this before?”\\nFu-fang was pinching her father’s upper lip. Huei-fang was\\nstanding in a daze with tears trickling down her cheeks. Fu-\\nfang repeated Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s question:\\n“Huei-fang, has father ever had attacks like this before? Has\\nhe? Come on, you must tell me.”\\n\\n“If it’s an attack of phlegm, it isn’t serious if only he can\\ncough. After a cough or two, he’ll come to.”\\n\\nThis diagnosis came from Tu Chu-chai. He glanced at Wu\\nSun-fu, fumbled nervously for his snuff-box and gave it to him.\\nWu Sun-fu took it, then turned on the servants furiously: ‘There\\nare too many people crowding round. The heat of your bodies\\n\\nalone’s enough to suffocate the old man.... Where’s that ice-\\nbag got to?... Pei-yao, we don’t need you here for the time\\nbeing: go and ring up Dr. Ting ... Wang Mah, you run and\\n\\nget an ice-bag.” He turned to Fu-fang: “Don’t worry, Fu-fang.\\nFather’s heart is still beating. But we shouldn’t leave him sit-\\nting in this chair. Let’s carry him over to the couch.” He im-\\nmediately put his arms round the old man to pick him up, and\\nthen the others came and lent him a hand. By the time Old\\nMr, Wu was lying on the velvet-cushioned couch, Mrs. Wu Sun-\\nfu came back from the telephone to tell them that the doctor\\nwould be over in ten minutes and that in the meantime he\\nshould lie undisturbed in a quiet room. The maid brought in\\nan ice-bag, and Wu Sun-fu quickly laid it on the old man’s fore-\\nhead. He shouted to another servant, who was standing in the\\ndoorway:\\n\\n“Go and call two or three men to carry Old Mr. Wu into the\\nsmall drawing-room. The doctor will be here any moment, s0\\ntell the porter to look out for him.”\\n\\nSuddenly the old man’s hand twitched. He made a noise in\\nhis throat and a frothy mucus oozed out of his mouth. “Oh,\\ngood!” several voices exclaimed with some relief. Young Mrs.\\nWu pulled a white handkerchief from Chang Su-su’s lapel and\\nwiped the old man’s lips with it. She cast a worried glance at\\nher husband, who frowned. Fu-fang and Tu Chu-chai also looked\\nworried. The blue veins on the old man’s forehead now stood\\nout like worms, the rasping in his throat became louder and\\nquicker and the froth still oozed from his lips. Suddenly, his\\nhand twitched again, and his eyelids fluttered a moment and then\\nremained half closed.\\n\\n“Oh! what’s keeping Dr. Ting? Let’s carry father into the\\nother room now,” muttered Wu Sun-fu, wringing his hands with\\nimpatience. He motioned to the four servants standing by to\\nlift the couch on which the old man was lying and carry it\\n\\ninto the small drawing-room. He followed behind with his wife,\\nTu Chu-chai, Fu-fang, and Huei-fang. Ah-hsuan, who had been\\nstanding by gaping, came to, looked round in alarm, scampered\\ninto the parlour, and slammed the door behind him.\\n\\n*\\n\\nAn uneasy silence fell upon the people left in the large\\ndrawing-room. Chang Su-su, leaning against a big, luxurious\\nradio-cabinet, was gazing pensively at the Book of Rewards and\\nPunishments lying on the floor. Two young men were sitting\\non a sofa, resting their heads on their hands, drawing slowly\\nat cigarettes and from time to time glancing nervously towards\\nthe door of the other room.\\n\\nThe room was still softly lit and the golden disc of the electric\\nfan continued to whir and turn slowly from side to side, sending\\na cool breeze over everybody and ruffling their clothes. These\\npeople, who had hitherto been used to comfort and pleasure,\\nnow felt a vague uneasiness.\\n\\nThe girl in light-yellow silk was sitting by the piano, idly turn-\\ning the pages of a score. She bore a striking resemblance to\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu and was, in fact, her younger sister, Lin Pei-shan.\\n\\nChang Su-su, who had been lost in thought, suddenly came to\\nas if she had an idea. She looked up sharply and glanced round\\nfor somebody to speak to. Catching the eye of Lin Pei-shan,\\nshe ran over to her, struck her palms together, and whispered\\nearnestly in an undertone:\\n\\n“Pei-shan, I\\'m afraid it’s all over with Old Mr. Wu! I\\'ve seen\\npeople—”\\n\\nHearing this, the two young men on the sofa jumped to their\\nfeet in surprise and looked at Chang Su-su with questioning eyes.\\n\\n“How can you be so sure about it?” asked Lin Pei-shan hes-\\nitantly, standing up.\\n\\n“How can I be sure? Well, this is not the first time I’ve seen\\nsomebody die!”\\n\\nSeveral servants had gathered around Chang Su-su and when\\nthey heard her say this, they could not help bursting out laugh-\\ning; but Chang Su-su kept a straight face. She lowered her voice\\nand went on mysteriously:\\n\\n“Do you think it was phlegm he was oozing out? Oh no!\\nNot at all! He was foaming at the mouth. When people die in\\n\\nhot weather, they usually foam at the mouth just as he did.\\nI know: I’ve seen it. And wouldn’t you call today hot? Eighty\\ndegrees, although it’s only the sixteenth of May. Am I right,\\nYu-ting? Go on!”\\n\\nChang Su-su turned and looked at one of the two men as\\nmuch as to say that he should nod his head to bear her out.\\nThe man, Li Yu-ting, was of medium height, had a sharply\\npointed face and wore thick-lensed glasses. He neither agreed\\nnor disagreed with her, but merely smiled cryptically, which\\ndid not please her at all. She glanced at him resentfully, pursed\\nher little scarlet lips and muttered crossly:\\n\\n“I shan’t forget this in a hurry! Teachers usually are pretty\\nspineless, but you university professors are even worse. Your\\nstudents don\\'t hesitate to speak their mind, but you professors\\nkeep to the middle of the road. Then you have to take all the\\nknocks and grin sheepishly. But we aren’t in class now, Pro-\\nfessor Li: we are in Mr. Wu\\'s!”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting stopped smiling and looked considerably chastened.\\nThe other man, Fan Po-wen, who was standing behind Lin Pei-\\nshan, whispered something to her which made her snigger and\\nflash an amused glance at Chang Su-su. The latter crimsoned,\\nswung round. bore down on Lin Pei-shan, and said with mock\\nannoyance: “What mischief are you two up to? Saying things\\nbehind my back, are you? Come on, say you’re sorry.”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan edged away, giggling and protecting herself with\\nher hands in case Chang Su-su should tickle her, and appealed\\nto the young man:\\n\\n“Po-wen, you started the trouble; how can you just stand\\nthere and watch?”\\n\\nJust then they heard the sound of a horn and a car drew up\\noutside. A tall middle-aged man in foreign dress hurried in,\\nfollowed by two nurses in white uniforms, one of them carry-\\ning a bulging Gladstone bag. Chang Su-su let go of Lin Pei-shan\\nand rose to greet the man:\\n\\n“How do you do, Dr. Ting? The patient\\'s in the small drawing-\\nroom.”\\n\\nSo saying, she tripped across to the door of the other room\\nand opened it noiselessly for the doctor and nurses, then slipped\\nin herself, closing it behind her.\\n\\nSmoothing her tousled hair, Lin Pei-shan said to her cousin:\\n\\n“Did you see how the doctor’s car raced up to the door? Just\\nlike a fire-engine.”\\n\\n“Ah, but his job is to kindle a spark of life in the old man,\\nnot to put it out!”\\n\\n“There you go again: poetry! Huh!”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan cast a saucy glance at Fan Po-wen and moved\\ntowards the door of the other room. The door opened and Chang\\nSu-su tiptoed out. Then a nurse appeared in the doorway, mo-\\ntioned a servant to come over, and handed him an enamel basin\\nfor some water. She withdrew behind the door and closed it.\\n\\nEverybody looked at Chang Su-su inquiringly. She gave a\\nslight shake of her head and without a word walked glumly\\nround a rosewood table. She stopped in front of Lin Pei-shan\\nand the others and said quietly:\\n\\n“Dr. Ting says it’s cerebral haemorrhage and puts it down to\\nover-excitement. He can’t say yet whether he’s going to live or\\nnot. Fancy it being over-excitement, though!”\\n\\nThey exchanged glances in silence. “Fancy that!’ echoed Li\\nYu-ting lamely after a moment, as if trying to make up for\\nupsetting Chang Su-su.\\n\\n“Yet to my mind it doesn’t really seem as strange as all that.\\nIt would be quite natural for Old Mr. Wu to become over-excited.\\nJust think what it’s been like for him living quietly down in the\\ncountry. He hasn\\'t set foot outside the house for the last twenty\\nyears or so. It’s been nothing short of a living grave, that study\\nof his that he’s been cooped up in all this time. And now today\\nhe’s suddenly been rushed off to Shanghai, where he sees and\\nhears and smells so many strange, new things which cannot but\\nover-excite him. He\\'s getting on in years and his health isn’t\\nall that good; it would be strange if he didn’t have an attack\\nof cerebral haemorrhage.”\\n\\nFan Po-wen spoke slowly with a feminine lilt in his voice,\\nand his face beamed smugly. He sought Lin Pei-shan’s eye, and\\nshe returned him a wry smile. Chang Su-su saw this. She de-\\nliberately kept a straight face and snorted:\\n\\n“Poet laureate! You’re even poetizing on someone’s death\\nnow!”\\n\\n“I may have chosen an unfortunate subject, Miss Chang, but\\nI don’t think I deserve such a dressing down.”\\n\\n“All right, then: would you rather it was your Lin Pei-shan\\ntelling you off?”\\n\\nThis time it was Lin Pei-shan’s turn to blush. She snorted\\nand walked off in a huff, followed by Fan Po-wen. Chang Su-\\nsu knitted her brows in a worried frown and paced round the\\nrosewood table once more, while Li Yu-ting just stood there\\nrubbing his chin. An oppressive silence fell on the room, broken\\nonly by the monotonous whir of the electric fan and the occa-\\nsional hoot of a car in the street, though even these sounded\\ndull and drowsy. A few servants stood motionless in the door-\\nway, and Wang Mah and another maid were whispering with\\ntheir heads together, their lips moving silently.\\n\\nThe door of the small drawing-room opened and the tall figure\\nof Dr. Ting emerged. He took a cigar from a silver case on an\\noval brass table, lit up, and sank into an armchair.\\n\\n“How is he?” asked Chang Su-su softly, going across to him.\\n\\n“He’s in a pretty bad way. I’ve just given him another in-\\njection.”\\n\\n“Don’t you think he’ll last the night?”\\n\\n“There’s no doubt about it!”\\n\\n*\\n\\nDr. Ting discarded his cigar and went back into the other\\nroom. Chang Su-su went softly across to the door and pulled\\nit up behind him. She wheeled round, ran back to Lin Pei-shan,\\nthrew her arms around her waist, and pressed her face against\\nhers. Stamping her feet, she whimpered:\\n\\n“Oh, Pei-shan! I do feel upset! I can’t bear to think about\\npeople dying, and dying so suddenly. I don’t want to die—I\\nwon’t die!”\\n\\n“But we all have to go one day.”\\n\\n“No, not me! Pei-shan, I won’t die!”\\n\\n“Perhaps you\\'re different from everyone else: when you get\\nold, you can slough your skin like a snake and be young again!\\n\\nAnyway, don’t keep pawing me so. Look what a mess\\nyou’re making of my hair! Oh, leave go of me, do!”\\n\\n“Never mind. You can go to the beauty parlour again tomor-\\nrow. Listen, Pei-shan: if I must die, I\\'d rather die of over-\\nexcitement.”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan started in surprise and looked into Chang Su-su\\'s\\neyes, which were shining with an unusual excitement which she\\nhad never seen there before.\\n\\n“To die of excitement! Yes, I think that would perhaps be\\nthe nicest way to die. But the sort of excitement I want is not\\nthe sort the old man had today. No, what I want is the excite-\\nment of some great upheaval like a storm, a volcanic eruption,\\nan earthquake, or to see the whole universe in chaos. Ah...\\nthat would be wonderful, magnificent!”\\n\\nAfter this outburst, Chang Su-su let go of Lin Pei-shan, stepped\\nback, sank into a rocking-chair, and buried her face in her hands.\\n\\nLi Yu-ting and Fan Po-wen, who had been standing by listen-\\ning, broke into a laugh. It seemed that the way Chang Su-su\\nhad struck out and then retreated amused them greatly. Seeing\\nthat Lin Pei-shan was still standing there absorbed in her own\\nthoughts, Fan Po-wen went over and took her hand. She started\\nat the touch but, when she saw it was Fan Po-wen, gave him\\nan arch look. He jerked his thumb in the direction of Chang\\nSu-su and whispered:\\n\\n“Now you can see what’s wrong with Su-su. She is very much\\nin need of excitement, but that dreary professor has none to\\noffer. Anyway, what she just said shows she’s got some poetic\\ntalent, I think.”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan smiled at first, but, when she heard his last re-\\nmark, she gave him an icy glare, snorted, and moved languidly\\naway. Realizing that she had misunderstood him, he ran after\\nher and caught her by the shoulder, but she angrily shrugged\\nfiis hand off, ran through the back door, and slammed it in his\\nface. He hesitated for a second, then dashed over, flung open\\nthe door and shouted, “Pei-shan!”\\n\\nThe slam startled Chang Su-su out of her reverie. She looked\\nup, then dropped her eyes again. Her gaze fell on the Book of\\nRewards and Punishments in its yellow damask case lying on a\\nlow rectangular table before her, picked it up, and began turning\\nover the pages of neat characters written on high-grade Chinese\\npaper. She paused at an epilogue by Old Mr. Wu, which read:\\n\\nI have had a hundred thousand copies of the Book of\\nRewards and Punishments reprinted for distribution among\\nmy fellow-believers, and also transcribed the whole text with\\nmy own hand....\\n\\nChang Su-su burst out laughing and was about to read on\\nwhen somebody spoke to her from behind:\\n\\n“Now there was a man who may truly be said to have had a\\nfaith and to have been loyal to it all his life.”\\n\\nIt was Li Yu-ting, leaning over the back of the chair, a cigarette\\nbetween his fingers. Chang Su-su glanced at him over her\\nshoulder, then looked down again at the book. After a while,\\nshe laid the book on her lap and asked abruptly:\\n\\n“Tell me, Yu-ting: what sort of a society are we living in?”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting was taken aback by this unexpected question, but,\\nbeing a professor of economics, he did not find it difficult to say\\nsomething:\\n\\n“It’s a tall order, your question. But you can find an answer\\nin the next room. There you have a successful financier and a\\ncaptain of industry. That little drawing-room is Chinese society\\nin miniature.”\\n\\n“But there’s also a pious old man—a believer in the Book of\\nRewards and Punishments.”\\n\\n“Yes, put the old man is—he’s dying fast.”\\n\\n“But in our country there are heaven knows how many more\\nlike him.”\\n\\n“Never mind. They\\'ll die directly they arrive in Shanghai.\\nShanghai is... .”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting broke off when the door from the next room opened\\nand Mrs. Wu Sun-fu came out. Except for a slight frown this\\nbeautiful young woman was as lively as ever. When she saw\\nthat Li Yu-ting and Chang Su-su were alone together here, she\\nshot them a surprised glance, but immediately changed it to a\\nhospitable smile. She called for the butler Kao Sheng and the\\nmaid Wang Mah. When they came in, she said:\\n\\n“It seems the old master cannot be expected to last the night\\nout. Kao Sheng, you telephone to the factory for Mr. Mo Kan-\\ncheng to come round at once. Then draw up a list of relatives\\nand friends of the family to be notified when he passes away.\\nAnd have your men tidy up the garden and everywhere and get\\n\\nthe spare chairs and tables out of the attic. If you’re short-\\nhanded, go and get some helpers from Mr. Tu Chu-chai’s place.\\nNow, Wang Mah, you take some maids to tidy up the guest-\\nrooms on the second floor and change all the net curtains, table-\\ncloths and loose covers.”\\n\\n“What about a shroud for the old master? And what kind of\\nwood —?”\\n\\n“you needn’t bother about that. Anyway, it hasn’t been de-\\ncided yet. We shall probably call in the International Under-\\ntakers. You just tell Mr. Mo Kan-cheng to bring with him as\\nmany men from the factory as he can spare.”\\n\\n“By the way, the Tai Sheng Chang Shipping Company’s just\\nsent over the old master’s luggage, twenty-eight pieces all told.”\\n\\n“All right, Wang Mah, you go and check them, and anything\\nthat isn\\'t needed for the time being you can put in the attic.”\\n\\nHearing someone in the next room call her name, Mrs. Wu\\nSun-fu hurried back to the small drawing-room. Before clos-\\ning the door behind her, she stuck out her head and asked:\\n\\n“Su-su, do you know where Pei-shan and Po-wen have vanished\\nto? Will you fetch them for me, please?”\\n\\nChang Su-su nodded but did not move. She was still reflect-\\ning on her discussion with Li Yu-ting and was thinking of pick-\\ning up the thread where they had left off. Li Yu-ting was\\npacing up and down and drawing on his cigarette in silence.\\nBy now it was nine o’clock, and out in the garden people were\\ncoming and going and bustling about. The lights among the\\ntrees, in the summerhouses and on the rockeries were switched\\non. Wang Mah led several stout women servants into the large\\ndrawing-room, where they began changing the crimson net cur-\\ntains for white ones. There was a large bundle of loose covers\\non the floor, and even the carpets were taken out to be beaten.\\n\\nThere was a scuffle from the next room, and suddenly there\\ncame the sound of sobbing voices and cries of “Father!” Chang\\nSu-su and Li Yu-ting looked tense. She rose and walked ner-\\nvously up and down, then ran across the room and pushed open\\nthe door. As the door opened, the big room was filled with the\\nsound of sobbing. Dr. Ting came out, rubbing his hands together,\\nand said to Li Yu-ting, “It’s all over.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu followed him out, his face gloomy. He told the\\nservants to ring up Mr. Chiu Chun, a lawyer, and ask him to\\ncome round. He turned to Li Yu-ting:\\n\\n“Yu-ting, I hope you can stay with us tonight and give us a\\nhand. It’s now gone nine and the newspapers may not be will-\\ning to accept our obituary notice as late as this, but it must\\nappear tomorrow morning without fail, so I wonder if you’d be\\ngood enough to go and arrange it? Chu-chai is wording it now.\\nIt’s to go to all the five leading papers, of course.” He turned\\nto the butler: “Kao Sheng! Why isn’t Mr. Mo Kan-cheng here\\nyet?”\\n\\nThe servant, who was standing on the steps outside, was just\\ngoing to answer, when Fu-fang ran out and seized Wu Sun-fu\\nby the arm and said:\\n\\n“I’ve just talked things over with Pei-yao about the shrouding\\nand we think we\\'d best put it off until the day after tomorrow\\nin the morning. We need a little time for the preparation and,\\nbesides, we\\'d better wait until Uncle Tseng Tsang-hai has ar-\\nrived. We can\\'t afford to slight him: you know what a fuss he\\nmakes.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu paused for a moment and then said firmly:\\n\\n“We\\'ll send him a telegram tonight. He may or may not\\narrive in time for the shrouding, but we can’t put it off simply\\nbecause of him. If he complains of anything, I\\'ll answer for it.\\nThe shrouding takes place at two o’clock tomorrow afternoon,\\ncome what may.”\\n\\nFu-fang would have liked to say something more, but he had\\nalready rushed back to the next room. Fu-fang eventually\\nfollowed him in.\\n\\nJust then, Lin Pei-shan and Fan Po-wen, hand in hand, came\\nout of the dining-room into the right-hand corner of the big\\nroom. They were taken aback at the din and bustle. Lin Pei-\\nshan said:\\n\\n“Tt looks as if the old man\\'s gone.”\\n\\n“If so, I’m not in the least surprised. When he lived in the\\ncountry he existed like a mummy. The country was his grave,\\nin which he couldn’t decompose easily. In this modern city of\\nShanghai he has done. He’s gone, and good riddance. One\\nmummy of old China the less. Old China herself is a mummy\\n\\nfive thousand years old, and she’s decomposing fast. She can’t\\nweather the storm of this new age much longer.”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan smiled wryly, and threw Fan Po-wen a sly glance\\nof pretended vexation.\\nII\\n\\nABOUT five o’clock next morning there were a few drops of\\nrain in the wind. It was much cooler than the evening before —a\\ndrop of nearly ten degrees — but by nine o’clock the sun, now\\nblazing high in the sky, had dispersed the lowering clouds and\\nthe temperature was up again to eighty degrees. One felt the\\nmenace of an even severer heat-wave.\\n\\nThe ushers at the Wus’ residence, holding aloft white card-\\nboard signs indicating their function and wearing coarse black\\ngowns tied at the waist with long, wide strips of thick white\\ncloth for belts, scurried to and fro in the scorching sun, from the\\nmain gate to the large drawing-room which was being used as\\na “ceremonial hall,’ and then back again to the main gate to\\nescort in more newly-arrived mourners. Every one of them was\\ntired and perspiring freely. Until half past ten, the eight of\\nthem now and then managed to snatch a moment\\'s rest on the\\nwooden benches beside the funeral musicians at the main gate,\\nwhere they would mop their brows with the loose ends of their\\nwhite belts and fan themselves with the cardboard signs while\\nthey regained their breath, grumbling because Mr. Wu Sun-fu\\nhad not employed more men to do this job. By midday, how-\\never, when the sun was beating down mercilessly on their heads,\\nthe visitors had begun to arrive in an endless stream, and the\\ntwo bands, one at the main gate and one before the hall, were\\nboth playing non-stop. The ushers rushed back and forth like\\nrobots, too busy now even to think of grumbling about Mr. Wu.\\nThey could at most cast envious glances at the six masters of\\nceremonies who were standing idly before the funeral hall.\\n\\nThe hooting of cars... the funeral din of flutes, trumpets\\nand gongs ... the bawling of waiters as they elbowed their way\\nback and forth with shouts of “Tea here!” and “Lemonade for\\n\\nthis gentleman!” ... the noise of chauffeurs and rickshaw boys\\nclamouring for tips ... the raised voices of policemen and plain-\\nclothes men shooing idle onlookers away from the main gate...\\nthe acrid smell of cigarette smoke and the odour of human\\nbodies — all mingled together and penetrated every corner of\\nthe Wu mansion and its acre and a half of garden.\\n\\nThe dining-room next to the funeral hall was packed with\\npeople. A huge mahogany sideboard stood across it like a bridge,\\npartitioning it into two sections. In the right-hand wall of\\nthe interior section were windows looking out on to the garden;\\nclose to the windows stood a tall trellis covered with banksia\\nroses, which afforded fragrance and shade to the whole room.\\nIn the left wall there were two doors, one of which opened on\\nto a veranda on which guests were sitting clustered around tea-\\ntables, holding forth noisily on “gold bullion,” “silver bars,”\\n“cotton yarn,” and “taels and cents,” their talk punctuated by\\nthe pfft! of lemonade bottles being opened. Close by a door at\\nthe extreme end of the veranda sat a man of about thirty in\\na khaki uniform and long riding-boots, with three or four enamel\\nbadges on his chest. He was sitting alone in a rocking-chair,\\nslowly sipping lemonade and glancing every so often at the door\\nbeside him. It was closed, but whenever it opened an inch or\\ntwo an intoxicating perfume and silvery laughter escaped through\\nthe crack.\\n\\nSuddenly the man in uniform put down his glass and stood\\nup, his spurs jingling, and sprang to attention, then made a low\\nbow to a woman appearing in the doorway.\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu was rather taken aback by this unexpected\\nshow of courtesy, but by the time he had straightened up she\\nhad recovered her composure and nodded with a smile.\\n\\n“Ah, Colonel Lei! You here? ... Nice of you to come.”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t mention it. I was planning to come tomorrow to\\nsay goodbye, but when I heard that this had happened, I felt I\\nhad to come to pay my last respects. They tell me Old Mr. Wu\\npassed away yesterday evening. If so, Madame, you must have\\nhad quite a time of it!” replied Col. Lei, smiling respectfully, at\\nthe same time glancing over Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s mourning dress:\\nan ankle-length black gauze dress with tight-fitting three-quarter\\nlength sleeves discreetly flattering her tall, elegant figure. She\\n\\nwore no make-up. Beneath her fine arched brows, her eyes,\\nthough just a little red from crying, were still as bright as they\\nalways had been, dancing and shining with infinite wisdom and\\nboundless charm. The colonel’s heart fluttered. This was the\\nfirst time he had seen this lovely creature as “Madame Wu.”\\nDeep in his heart lingered the memory of another lovely creature\\nof five years ago, when she was not yet “Madame Wu” but just\\n“Miss Lin Pei-yao” and her image suddenly rose before his eyes\\nagain and tugged mercilessly at his heartstrings. The reappear-\\nance of this ghost from the past — and at such a moment as this —\\nseemed so cruel. Without waiting for her reply, he compressed\\nhis lips, made another bow, and left hurriedly. He made his\\nway through the babel of voices holding forth on “gold” and\\n“cotton yarn,” and into the inner half of the dining-room.\\n\\n*\\n\\nAs soon as he stepped into the room, he was hailed by two\\nvoices simultaneously:\\n\\n“Look, here’s Colonel Lei! You\\'re just in time to help us out.”\\n\\nThis simultaneous appeal to a third party worked like a charm\\nand the voices which had been raised in argument suddenly sub-\\nsided. All eyes turned to Col. Lei as he stood in the doorway,\\ncausing the vision of Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s simple beauty to vanish\\nfrom his mind. He smiled and let his eyes travel over the faces\\nturned towards him, then swung his right hand up in a salute\\nand cut it sharply away. He walked over to the group, clapped\\na short, fat man on the shoulder and grasped a hand held out\\nto him, and said heartily:\\n\\n“Not talking about gold and cotton yarn and the prices again,\\nare you? Quite beyond me, all that sort of thing.” The short,\\nfat man raised his eyebrows in mock incredulity and laughed,\\nbut before he had a chance to say anything, the youngster who\\nhad shaken hands with the colonel broke in with:\\n\\n“Gold and cotton yarn? No, nothing like that—and not the\\nsubjects you are an expert in, either, like the foxtrot or the tango\\nor the ‘Rio Rita’ songs. No, we\\'re discussing the military situa-\\ntion. Come on and sit down with us.”\\n\\n“I know you, Huang Fen: you’ve never got a good word to\\nsay for it,” said Col. Lei frowning in feigned protest and squeezed\\nin on the sofa beside Huang Fen, who was in European dress.\\n\\nThe two had been fellow-cadets at the Whampoa Military\\nAcademy and after graduation had been in action together. They\\nwere on fairly good terms, but the things in which Col. Lei\\nwas interested and at which he excelled were a closed book to\\nHuang Fen; conversely, whenever the conversation came round\\nto Huang Fen’s “work,” on which he was so keen, Col. Lei,\\nalthough he could be trusted to respect the other’s confidences,\\nalways shook his head. Just lately the two of them had seen\\neach other almost every day, but every time they met they\\nquarrelled. Seeing that Huang Fen was in one of his provocative\\nmoods again with all these people present, Col. Lei felt ill at ease.\\nHe would have liked to escape but he could not just walk out on\\nhim.\\n\\nThere was a brief spell of modest silence as if, before the\\nnewcomer, nobody was in a hurry to express his opinion now.\\nMeanwhile, the gathering in the other half of the dining-room\\nbroke into peals of laughter and someone shouted: “Serve\\nhim right! ... Give him what for!” The voice sounded rather\\nfamiliar to Col. Lei. He looked to see who it was, but his view\\nwas blocked by the short, fat man and another man with a small\\nhead perched on a slender neck, sitting with their backs to the\\nhuge sideboard at a square table cluttered up with lemonade\\nbottles and fruit-dishes. When the short, fat man saw that the\\ncolonel was looking at his companion, he thought that the colonel\\nprobably wanted to get to know him, so he quickly rose and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Let me introduce my friend to you, Colonel Lei: Mr. Sun\\nChi-jen, manager of the Pacific Steamship Company.”\\n\\nThe colonel smiled and nodded to Sun Chi-jen, who produced\\na card. Col. Lei gave it a cursory glance and said:\\n\\n“Oh, I see, Mr. Sun, you’re also running a long-distance bus\\nservice in northern Anhwei. Congratulations on your possessing\\nthe means of both land and water transportation!”\\n\\n“Quite so,” chimed in the short, fat man, before Sun Chi-jen\\ncould reply. “Mr, Sun’s a man of energy and vision. Unfor-\\ntunately, that part of Anhwei is at present involved in the war,\\nand consequently Mr. Sun’s business has had to be temporarily\\nsuspended. ... But tell us, Colonel Lei, how is the war really\\ngoing just lately?”\\n\\nHe had a reputation for engineering friendships between stran-\\ngers and was a skilful flatterer. He was nicknamed “Red-tipped\\nMatch”—not only because he owned the Kwang Tah Match\\nFactory, but also because he had the knack of kindling the flame\\nof friendship. His real name—Chou Chung-wei—was therefore\\neclipsed in a way by this nickname.\\n\\nNo sooner were the words out of his mouth than several other\\nvoices chorused:\\n\\n“Yes, tell us what really is going on.”\\n\\nCol. Lei smiled slightly and answered vaguely:\\n\\n“More or less what you read in the papers.”\\n\\n“The papers keep telling us the Central Army is winning, but\\naccording to the rumours going round the town things aren\\'t\\ngoing so well, And if the papers don’t give reliable information,\\ntheir readers get all the more panicky,” a man in his forties\\nwith a drooping moustache observed in a ringing voice. Col. Lei\\nrecognized him as Wang Ho-fu, general manager of the Ta Hsing\\nCoal-mining Company. They had met once in a county in Honan,\\nwhere the colonel was commanding a regiment.\\n\\nEverybody nodded agreement with Wang Ho-fu’s observation.\\nSun Chi-jen spoke next, wagging his head on his long neck:\\n\\n“Perhaps the rumours are exaggerated, but there’s no end of\\nwounded coming in just now. One of our boats called at Pukow\\nthe day before yesterday and was immediately commandeered\\nto move over a thousand wounded to Changchow, Wusih, and\\nsome other places along the railway. According to some of the\\nwounded, things are in a pretty bad way.”\\n\\n“And the Japanese papers say that a certain important man\\nfrom the South has reached an understanding with a certain\\nimportant man from the North and that he’ll soon stage a\\ncoup d’etat,” put in a man named Chu Yin-chiu, the owner of a\\nsilk factory, sitting opposite Sun Chi-jen. As he said this, he\\ncast a malicious glance at Col. Lei and at the same time nudged\\nhis neighbour, a thin man of about forty named Chen Chun-yi,\\nthe owner of the Wu Yun Silk Goods Factory, but the latter\\njust smiled.\\n\\nCol. Lei was not conscious of the malicious look in Chu Yin-\\nchiu’s eyes, nor did he notice the quick exchange of knowing\\nglances between Chu and Chen; nevertheless he felt rather\\n\\nuneasy. As an officer on the active list, he was naturally embar-\\nrassed at such a conversation, especially with the indiscreet\\nHuang Fen at his side. After a moment’s hesitation he said\\nto Sun Chi-jen:\\n\\n“J see, one of your boats was used to move more than a\\nthousand wounded, eh? Yes, well, there have been quite a\\nlot of casualties just lately. But it only means our troops are\\ndoing a real job at the front. And sacrifices are inevitable\\nwhen there’s any serious fighting. But don’t forget the enemy\\nis being hit even harder. Huang Fen, don’t you remember when\\nwe were fighting along the Peking-Hankow Railway in 727? The\\ncasualties among our 4th and 11th Armies were well over twenty\\nthousand and you saw nothing but wounded men in Hankow\\nand Wuchang. But we won in the end, didn’t we?”\\n\\nBy this time he was slightly flushed, and he glanced round\\nat his listeners to see what effect his words had produced. He\\nwas now eager to change the subject but Huang Fen jumped in\\nwith a sarcastic smile and asked pointedly:\\n\\n“Did you mention the battle of ’27 along the Peking-Hankow\\nRailway? That was altogether different from what’s happening\\nnow. The casualties were heavy then because our men fought\\nand died with a will. But, today, I’m sure it’s quite a different\\nstory, eh?”\\n\\nThe colonel’s face suddenly blanched, as if a shell had fallen\\nbeside him. He stood up, looked all round, sat down again, and\\nmanaged to cover his nervousness with a smile:\\n\\n“My dear fellow, don’t talk such nonsense!”\\n\\n“Nonsense, is it? It’s the truth, and you know it is. Otherwise,\\nwhy are you still back here, and not at the front?”\\n\\n“I\\'m leaving for the front the day after tomorrow,” Col. Lei\\nanswered loudly with a triumphant smile. This heroic declara-\\ntion of his greatly moved his listeners, and was even heard by\\npeople in the front half of the room. There was a sudden\\nsilence, and several people came round from the other side. They\\nhadn’t quite heard what it was all about; they only saw Chou\\nChung-wei, the “Red-tipped Match,” his face wreathed in smiles\\nand his hand on the colonel’s shoulder, saying to Sun Chi-jen:\\n\\n“Mr. Sun, I suggest that we give Col. Lei a send-off tomorrow\\nevening. Do you agree?”\\n\\nBefore Sun Chi-jen could answer, Wang Ho-fu chimed in:\\n\\n“Col. Lei’s an old friend of mine, so let it be on me... or,\\nif you insist, we can split it three ways.”\\n\\nThen the group split up. Chou Chung-wei, Sun Chi-jen, Wang\\nHo-fu and three other men sat at a square table, centred round\\nCol. Lei and exchanging compliments and commonplace polite-\\nnesses. The other group consisted of Chu Yin-chiu, Chen Chun-\\nyi and several others with Huang Fen in their centre, were\\nclustered under the windows on the right-hand side of the room,\\nmost of them standing, still discussing the military situation.\\nThe few people who had come across from the front half of\\nthe room joined this group. Huang Fen spoke loudly and un-\\nreservedly to one of the newcomers, a man by the name of\\nTang Yun-shan:\\n\\n“Yun-shan, do you know what? Col. Lei is going to the front!\\nThat proves that they’re hard pressed there; otherwise they\\nwouldn’t have posted him.”\\n\\n“You’re telling me! A few days ago the New First Division,\\na crack division, was practically wiped out in a battle at Yachi-\\nkang. Trained by German officers, and with the most up-to-\\ndate German equipment, they still didn’t have a chance against\\nthe daredevils of Feng Yu-hsiang’s Northwestern Army. ... But\\nwhat’s the colonel going to do at the front? Just be a staff\\nofficer?”\\n\\n“They\\'ll probably give him a brigade, as so many brigade com-\\nmanders and regiment commanders have been killed in action—\\nat least half a dozen of them so far.”\\n\\n“They say,” broke in Chu Yin-chiu, “that an army commander\\nhas been killed and another high-ranking officer wounded. Is\\nthat true, do you know?” Tang Yun-shan laughed, glancing at\\nHuang Fen as much as to say: You see how news gets around!\\nBefore his chuckle had died away somebody added:\\n\\n“No, the army commander hasn\\'t been killed. He’s seriously\\nwounded. Someone has seen him in the French Hospital on Route\\nPere Robert.”\\n\\nChen Chun-yi, as if afraid that his listeners might not readily\\ncredit his statement, said this in a categorical tone of voice and\\nalso appealed to a tall, hefty man, Dr. Ting, to bear him cut:\\n\\n“Dr, Ting, I’m sure you can confirm that what I just said is\\nnot just a rumour. I understand Dr. Po of the French Hospital\\nwas a fellow-student of yours. You must have heard about it\\nfrom him?”\\n\\nAll eyes now turned to Dr. Ting. At first he seemed not\\nto understand what it was all about and why Chen Chun-yi was\\nbringing him into it. Then he smiled as if he had just understood\\nand said with deliberation:\\n\\n“You’re right, lots of officers have been wounded. In my pro-\\nfession I have to know the difference between different kinds of\\nwounds—bullet wounds, bayonet wounds, shrapnel wounds, and\\nso forth. But when it comes to commanders of armies or\\nbrigades or regiments I don’t know one from the other. In the\\neyes of the surgeon, there’s no difference between the wounds of\\narmy commanders and the wounds of common soldiers: I just\\ndeal with them as they come, and I’ve no idea who is an army\\ncommander or even if there are any.”\\n\\nHis attentive audience laughed and then fell silent, as if not\\nsatisfied with this answer and Chen Chun-yi shook his head in\\ndisappointment. Then a babel of argument broke out again.\\nSuddenly, someone dashed over from the other side—a young\\nman wearing a flannel suit and with his hair sleeked back. He\\nhurriedly squeezed into the doctor\\'s group, where his keen eyes\\nsingled out a middle-aged man in a pale-blue silk gown and with\\na toothbrush moustache. He clapped him on the shoulder and\\ncried excitedly:\\n\\n“Hey! Chuang-fei, government bonds are dropping again! What\\nare you going to do with your hundred thousand Army Disband-\\nments? There are rumours flying about and everybody’s expect-\\ning prices to drop even further.”\\n\\nThis was even more alarming than the news from the front.\\nLi Chuang-fei, the man with the toothbrush moustache, turned\\ndeathly pale. Chou Chung-wei, Col. Lei and the rest of their\\ngroup hurried over to find out just what was happening. This\\nwas an age of speculation. How could anybody with any sum\\nof money resist dabbling in government bonds? People reacted\\ndifferently to the news of slump. The bears were jubilant and\\ngrinned from ear to ear, while the bulls tried hard to swallow\\ntheir disappointment.\\n\\n“Government bonds down again! Limit reached and trading\\nclosed!” somebody shouted through the door to the people on the\\nveranda, and immediately there was a rush into the dining-room\\nof those who had been expatiating on “gold” and “cotton yarn.”\\nWith staring eyes and craning their necks, they peered and\\njostled back and forth, all shouting at once and demanding:\\n\\n“Is it Tariff going down?”\\n\\n“Army Reorganization, did you say?”\\n\\n“Army Disbandment?”\\n\\nThe five or six people who had remained in the front section\\nof the dining-room were also attracted by this sudden turmoil\\nover government bonds, but kept their distance and just looked\\non. Among them were Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-sheng, a\\nsociology student and a distant relative of Wu Sun fu. Fan Po-\\nwen narrowed one eye and muttered:\\n\\n“Oh, speculation fever, speculation fever! And you, deluge of\\ngold, may you overflow, overflow and smash through your\\ndikes! .. .”\\n\\nHe gave Wu Chih-sheng a hearty slap on the back and boomed:\\n\\n“Chih-sheng, do you know that smart young fellow in the\\nwhite flannel that dashed in a moment ago? He’s a queer fish.\\nHan Meng-hsiang is his name; stockbroker by profession, but\\nwrites poetry as well—quite good poetry, too. Funny combination,\\nthat—poetry and lucre! But that\\'s enough about him: let’s go\\nand look for Tu Hsueh-shih and Pei-shan. We may find them in\\nthe small drawing-room, and the air there may be cleaner and\\nnot reek of money-grubbing as it does here.”\\n\\nWithout waiting for his agreement, Fan Po-wen dragged Wu\\nChih-sheng away with him. By now the dining-room had thinned\\nout, and only a handful of businessmen who were not greatly\\nconcerned about the vicissitudes of government bonds and a few\\npeople who were more concerned with politics, such as Col. Lei,\\nHuang Fen and Tang Yun-shan, still lingered there, helping\\nthemselves to more lemonade and chattering away. But their\\nconversation had now turned from war and politics to amuse-\\nments—roulette, bordellos, greyhound racing, romantic Turkish\\nbaths, dancing girls, film stars. Col. Lei felt more at home on\\nthese subjects and threw his reserve to the winds.\\n\\n*\\n\\n4)\\nAs midday approached the mourners decreased in numbers\\nand the two bands took turns to play, occasionally stopping\\naltogether. When they did so, the unusual quiet made the\\npeople in the dining-room feel as if their ears had been suddenly\\nunstopped and their talk about Turkish baths, dancing girls and\\nfilm stars sounded unusually loud.\\n\\nSuddenly, they all fell silent as if ashamed to hear their own\\nsmutty talk in the sudden quiet.\\n\\nTang Yun-shan involuntarily raised his hand to scratch his\\nbald head, glanced round, and burst out laughing; then all the\\nothers quickly took their cue from him and laughed in unison\\nto cover the embarrassing situation.\\n\\nWhen the laughter had subsided, Col. Lei turned to Chou\\nChung-wei and said seriously:\\n\\n“Everybody is saying that while gold is dear and silver is\\ncheap Chinese industrialists have an excellent opportunity to\\ndevelop their enterprises and sell their products. How far is that\\ntrue?”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei closed his eyes and shook his head, then\\nopened them again and replied with some bitterness:\\n\\n“T for one am the victim of dear gold and cheap silver. The\\nraw materials needed for making matches, such as chemicals,\\ntimber and boxes, are all imported. The price of gold rises\\nand with it the prices of raw materials: does that do me any\\ngood? Shall I use Chinese materials, then? If I do, I am con-\\nfronted with a whole string of taxes—raw material tax, transit\\nduty, likin levy—which make our own raw materials dearer than\\nimported ones. On top of that, Japanese and Swedish matches\\noffer serious competition to Chinese matches, and our people\\ndon’t know what patriotism is and won’t buy Chinese-made\\ngoods... .”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei broke off in the middle of his patriotic\\nspeech when his eyes chanced upon a box of “Phoenix” brand\\nmatches, made in Sweden, lying beside a silver-plated ashtray.\\nHe coughed with embarrassment, pulled out a handkerchief,\\nand wiped his plump face vigorously. Tang Yun-shan sniggered,\\npurposely reached out for the Swedish matches, and lit a Garrick.\\nBlowing out a cloud of smoke, he slapped Chou Chung-wei heavily\\non the shoulder and said:\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, Mr. Chou, but to tell the truth, your own\\nproducts could bear improvement. Leaving out your safety\\nmatches for the moment, people say that your red-tipped matches\\ndon’t strike easily. They won’t stand comparison with your\\nesteemed name.”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei’s face reddened like one of his own red-tipped\\nmatches, but Sun Chi-jen came to his rescue:\\n\\n“Mr. Chou’s hardly to blame for that. His workers are\\npretty tough and not easy to manage. Since trade unions have\\ncome into being, a lot of factories have been suffering from\\nidleness and have been turning out poor-quality products. Isn\\'t\\nthat so, Mr. Chu?”\\n\\n“That’s it, but that isn’t all. Take our silk industry, which\\nis in a pitiful state. It’s being attacked from four sides: workers\\ndemand higher wages; we\\'re up against competition from\\nJapanese silk in foreign markets; taxes at home are crushing;\\nand the bankers are stingy with their loans. I ask you, what hope\\nis there for us, what with high production-costs, dwindling\\nmarkets, and a shortage of capital? It breaks my heart just to\\nthink about it all.”\\n\\nThis sad tale came from Chu Yin-chiu. As he told it, the\\nvision of his four enemies hovered before his eyes, with the\\nbankers in the lead trying to strangle him. The Dragon-boat\\nFestival* would be upon him soon and all the banks and money-\\nlenders that had had dealings with him had warned him that\\nthey would make no more advances and that he would have to\\nsettle up promptly what was outstanding. But how could he\\nsettle up with them? The price of silk was dropping, and his\\nexports were falling off. He drew a deep sigh and went on\\nresentfully:\\n\\n“Since last year there’s been plenty of cash about in Shanghai.\\nNobody can say money’s tight. But our bankers only invest in\\ngovernment bonds and land, ten or twenty million dollars at a\\ntime—simply throwing money about. When we industrialists get\\na bit short and try to get a loan of a paltry hundred thousand or\\neighty thousand dollars on some securities, they fight shy of us as\\n\\n* The Dragon-boat Festival (Tuan Yang Chieh) falls on the fifth\\nday of the fifth lunar month. Chinese merchants used to settle ac-\\ncounts on this day and also on the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\n\\nif we were murderers after their blood.... And their terms\\nare so extortionate that—well, they make me see red!”\\n\\nThey all thought Chu Yin-chiu was being rather too outspoken\\nand nobody seemed willing to make any comment. Though Huang\\nFen seemed sympathetic, he could not help saying:\\n\\n“IT don’t see why you have to depend entirely on foreign markets\\nto sell your products. If you do, where do our own silk goods\\nmanufacturers get their silk?”\\n\\n“Yes, I don’t see that, either. Mr. Chen, you’re the man to\\nexplain that to us,” Col. Lei interposed, appealing to Chen\\nChun-yi, the owner of the Wu Yun Silk Goods Factory.\\n\\nBut the manufacturer merely smiled, and Chu Yin-chiu, the\\nsilk producer, supplied the answer:\\n\\n“The silk goods manufacturers used to buy only our second-\\ngrade silk, and now they buy very little even of that; they prefer\\nto buy Japanese silk and rayon. For our top-grade silk, we have\\nalways had to rely on the French and American markets, but\\nfor the last couple of years the Japanese Government has gone\\nall out to encourage the Japanese silk producers to export their\\nsilk and cocoons by making such exports duty-free. As a result,\\nJapanese silk has crowded out Chinese silk in Lyons and New\\nYork.”\\n\\nCol. Lei and Huang Fen sprang up with exclamations of\\namazement and looked one by one at the circle of faces around\\nthem, hoping to discover in them some sign of agreement, but,\\nto their even greater astonishment, there was not the slightest\\nexpression of surprise on any of these faces, as if it were quite\\nnatural for Chinese silk goods manufacturers not to use Chinese\\nsilk. Chen Chun-yi said with deliberation:\\n\\n“We\\'ve no other way out than to use some Japanese silk\\nor even rayon. Take Mr. Chu’s silk, for example. Production-\\ncosts are high, which means a high price. If we buy his silk,\\nwe pay the high price and 65 dollars and 60 cents purchase-\\ntax per picul into the bargain. As for silk produced in the\\nprovinces, the prices have recently gone up as those of local\\nsilk have, and we have to pay 111 dollars and 69 cents purchase-\\ntax per picul as well. And all that is just paying for the raw\\nmaterial. .When it\\'s been made into silk goods, we have to pay\\na whole string of taxes in addition—production duty, transit\\nduty, market duty, and what have you. Every move the goods\\nmake, there’s another tax to pay. Of course, all these taxes are\\npaid eventually by the consumers, But it means our sales are\\nreduced. Now, if we are to keep up our sales, we must find a\\nway of reducing costs, and the only way we can do that is to use\\ncheaper raw materials.... The consumers complain of high\\nprices, but it doesn’t mean that the producers are making any-\\nthing out of it.”\\n\\nFor a while no one spoke. The sound of the trumpets and\\nflutes of the band outside drifted in on the wind, so melancholy\\nthat it might have been a dirge for the Chinese silk industry.\\nWang Ho-fu, wllo had been silent all the while, suddenly stocd\\nup, clapped his hands together, and said jokingly:\\n\\n“Let’s leave it at that, then! Mr. Chen goes on using his\\nJapanese silk and rayon, while Mr. Sun and I, as long as the\\nwar lasts, hang on in Shanghai and have a good time going\\naround the dog-tracks and brothels! To hell with industry! Let’s\\nenjoy ourselves while we can.”\\n\\nAs he was saying this a sudden breath of perfume heralded a\\nyoung woman in a sleeveless, black silk summer dress in the\\nlatest Paris style, which set off her smooth, white skin and her\\nfresh red lips. She did not speak at once, but just stood smiling\\nin the doorway and sweeping her eyes over the gathering.\\n\\nThe first to realize that she was there was the short, fat\\nman, Chou Chung-wei. He sprang up with a cry of delight,\\nwaved his arms excitedly, and cried:\\n\\n“Everybody stand up and welcome Miss Hsu Man-li, the\\nFlower of Society!”\\n\\nAll the men turned round. Before they could assume the\\nspecial smile which they reserved for greeting attractive women,\\nMiss Hsu was already giggling uncontrollably, her hips swaying\\nand her mouth hidden behind a handkerchief. Col. Lei rose\\nand stepped forward, holding out his hand, and said:\\n\\n“Miss Hsu, you’re late. We\\'ll have to punish you!”\\n\\n“And how are you going to do that?” asked Hsu Man-li with\\nmock seriousness, swaying her hips once more and tilting her\\nhead on one side. She went up to Col. Lei, squeezed his hand,\\n\\nheld it a few seconds, then dropped it and turned to greet the\\nothers.\\n\\nThe conversation revived magically. Chu Yin-chiu and Chen\\nChun-yi, who had a moment ago been grumbling, were now\\nbeaming. While Hsu Man-li was busy chatting with the others,\\nChu Yin-chiu leant across and whispered something to Tang Yun-\\nshan, who burst out laughing and looked at her intently. Chu\\nYin-chiu turned to Chen Chun-yi, deliberately raising his voice:\\n\\n“Y remember now, Mr. Chen. The woman who booked in at\\n\\n“the Cathay Hotel with Chao Po-tao yesterday was... .”\\n\\nHsu Man-li turned her head sharply, riveted her eyes for a\\nfleeting moment on Chu Yin-chiu and immediately looked away\\nagain. Without interrupting the smooth flow of her small-talk,\\nshe strained her ears to catch every word Chu Yin-chiu might\\nbe saying for her benefit.\\n\\nBut it was Chen Chun-yi’s voice that she heard next:\\n\\n“Chao Po-tao? The one who goes in for government bonds?\\nHe’s a big bull—grabs anything that’s going in the way of gov-\\nernment stock.”\\n\\n“And anything going in the way of women, too. Only yesterday\\nI met him with a certain widow.”\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu pretended to lower his voice, but he knew very\\nwell that Hsu Man-li could still hear it. He noticed that she\\nseemed to be trembling all over and that even her laugh was\\nrather forced and shaky.\\n\\nBy now Col. Lei was completely engrossed in the “Flower of\\nSociety” and their conversation became more and more lively and\\nintimate, until he said something which set her blushing; she\\ntilted her head coquettishly and giggled. Wang Ho-fu, who was\\nsitting nearby, stuck up his thumb in admiration and was going\\nto applaud, when Tang Yun-shan brushed past, grasped Col. Lei\\nby the shoulder and cried:\\n\\n“T say, old chap! What are you trying to do—kill a bull?”\\n\\n“Why? I never go in for government bonds,” replied the colonel\\nblankly,\\n\\n“Well, then, when somebody else has already cornered some-\\nthing, why do you try so hard to get her away from him?”\\n\\nAs he said this, Tang Yun-shan burst out laughing himself.\\nChu Yin-chiu and Chen Chun-yi applauded gleefully and roared\\nwith laughter. Hsu Man-li blushed furiously though she pre-\\ntended not to notice the taunt, and tried to pass it off by calling\\n\\nfor lemonade. But everybody guessed what it was all about and\\nthe big dining-room rang with peals of laughter.\\n\\nThe ragging might have gone on if Tu Chu-chai had not sudden-\\nly appeared.\\n\\nAs if suddenly realizing that they had come to mourn the death\\nof Old Mr. Wu, who was at this moment lying in the next room,\\nand that Tu Chu-chai was the dead man’s son-in-law, they all\\ninstantly checked their levity and tried to look serious, and some\\nof them yawned.\\n\\nAs usual Tu Chu-chai was all smiles and greeted everybody\\ncourteously, at the same time mumbling as if to himself:\\n\\n“Where’s Wu Sun-fu gone? He isn’t here either!”\\n\\n“He hasn’t been here,” said one of them. Tu Chu-chai frowned\\nin perplexity, excused himself politely, and hurried out again.\\nThen Hsu Man-li slipped out, closely followed by Col. Lei. By\\nnow everyone was tired of sitting about, and some of them went\\nout on to the veranda to look for friends. Only Huang Fen, Tang\\nYun-shan, Sun Chi-jen remained, still huddled on a sofa, talking\\nquietly and seriously about the “Enlarged Conference of the\\nNorth’* and the strategy of General Yen Hsi-shan and General\\nFeng Yu-hsiang.\\n\\n*\\n\\nFailing to find Wu Sun-fu anywhere, Tu Chu-chai went out\\ninto the garden, cut across the asphalt drive and clambered up\\na big artificial hill. In a hexagonal pavilion at the top of the hill\\ntwo gentlemen were waiting for him rather impatiently. One of\\nthem was in his forties, of medium height, with a pointed face and\\nblack, piercing eyes. He was Chao Po-tao, the wizard of the\\nstock market, the man Chu Yin-chiu and the rest of them had\\n\\n*In May 1930 Yen Hsi-shan and Feng Yu-hsiang, then warlords\\nin the North, joined with Li Tsung-jen, a warlord in Kwangsi Prov-\\nince, and certain other warlords in the South in the formation of\\na military alliance aimed against Chiang Kai-shek and launched a\\nfull-scale war against him in Honan Province and other places. In\\nJuly of the same year the Kuomintang politician Wang Ching-wei,\\nin conjunction with Yen Hsi-shan, Feng Yu-hsiang, and the various\\nother warlords who were opposing Chiang Kai-shek, held their\\nEnlarged Conference in Peking, at which they decided to set up a\\ngovernment in opposition to the Chiang Kai-shek régime in Nanking.\\nThis military alliance was smashed by Chiang Kai-shek’s forces soon\\nafter it was formed.\\n\\njust been talking about. Seeing Tu Chu-chai panting up the\\nsteps, he said to his companion:\\n\\n“Mr. Shang, look, Tu Chu-chai’s on his own. It looks as if Wu\\nSun-fu won’t bite.”\\n\\n“Mr. Shang” slowly fingered his three-inch bushy beard, but\\nmade no reply. Sixty if a day, he had a square face, large ears\\nand small eyes, and bore himself with dignity. If the Hung Hsien\\ndynasty of Yuan Shih-kai had not collapsed, he, Shang Chung-li,\\nmight have qualified for the honour of “Literary Attendant” in the\\nimperial court. As it was, he had abandoned an official career\\nand gone into business and become chairman of the board of direc-\\ntors of a trust company, which he regarded as quite a come-down.\\n\\nTu Chu-chai sat down and mopped his brow with a handker-\\nchief, then looked up and said to Chao Po-tao and Shang Chung-li:\\n\\n“T couldn’t find Sun-fu anywhere about the house. He wasn’t\\nin the ceremony hall nor in his room, nor in the dining-hall. His\\nwife and sisters couldn\\'t tell me where he’d gone. And I couldn’t.\\nvery well go around asking everybody I met, as you\\'d told me\\nto be careful not to attract too much attention. .... Well, you\\nmight as well tell me all about your plan so that I can talk it\\nover with Sun-fu later on.”\\n\\n“Well, as I told you just now, the idea is that the four of us\\nclub together on the quiet to buy long in the government\\nbonds;* but first we must raise four million dollars in ready cash\\n\\n*In those days government bonds were the chief object of specula-\\ntion on the Shanghai Stock and Bond Exchange. Independent of\\ntheir face value, their market quotation constantly fluctuated as a\\nresult of the ceaseless civil strife. Quotations were also greatly in-\\nfluenced by the manipulation of speculators. Those who expected a\\nchange in the political situation in favour of the government would\\n“bull” the market, i.e. buy long, in the belief that prices of the\\nbonds would rise, while those who thought prices would weaken\\nwould ‘‘bear” the market, i.e. sell short. In addition there were the\\nsmall speculators who gambled on skilfully-spread rumours or “in-\\nside information’—all the tricks and ruses of the big “bulls” and\\n“bears” to influence the market in their favour. So the prices of\\nthe bonds went up or down at each session of the Exchange, de-\\npending on the buying or selling pressure. Thus, even though polit-\\nical conditions might actually remain unchanged, the cut-throat fight\\nbetween the “bulls” and the “bears” went on in the Exchange. In\\nthese speculative transactions no delivery of the bonds themselves\\nor the total amount of cash involved was looked for. All the money\\n\\nwithin two days. Mr. Shang and I haven\\'t the necessary capital,\\nbut if you and Sun-fu are willing to come in on it, we\\'ll go right\\nahead with it. If you’re not, we\\'ll say no more about it,” said\\nChao Po-tao, talking quickly in Pekinese with a Cantonese\\naccent, while his deep-set eyes flashed a keen glance at Tu Chu-\\nchai to observe his reaction.\\n\\n“I don’t see why you should want to buy long, though. For\\nthe past few days, government bonds have been dropping as a\\nresult of the war, and although they may come up again some\\ntime in the future, you surely don\\'t think the war’s going to be\\nover straight away? Anyway, it’s an open secret that the gov-\\nernment troops are very hard pressed just now. Small holders\\nare selling out in a rush. Even if you buy in heavily, you won\\'t\\nbe able to hold up the prices. Besides, the settlement’s only ten\\ndays away. Does it mean that you want to do the buying beyond\\nthat date? If so, four million won’t be enough... !”\\n\\n“That’s the way everybody looks at it, but there’s more to this\\nthan meets the eye: we have a secret!” interrupted Chao Po-tao,\\ncutting Tu Chu-chai short and smiling mysteriously. Tu Chu-\\nchai tilted his head back and closed his eyes as if he were think-\\ning hard. He knew that Chao Po-tao was infinitely resourceful,\\nknew how to bluff his way, and had contacts in the army and\\nin political circles, so perhaps he had got hold of secret informa-\\ntion about the military situation. But on second thoughts that\\ndidn\\'t seem likely. Tu Chu-chai opened his eyes again only\\nto meet Chao Po-tao’s, sharp and cunning. It suddenly occurred\\nto Tu Chu-chai that Chao Po-tao, a bull, confronted with the\\ncoming settlement at the Dragon-boat Festival, was probably in\\na panic about his financial affairs and that his “secret bull com-\\npany” idea was merely a scheme to save himself.... But\\nwhy was Shang Chung-li going in with Chao Po-tao? The old\\nrogue was not buying long! With these thoughts racing through\\n\\nthe “bear” or the “bull” needed to have was the amount he thought\\nwould be sufficient to cover his net loss by the settlement date.\\nThis made it possible for speculators to gambie in bonds involving\\nmany times the money they possessed. Such general practice, how-\\never, did not exclude the employment by the more powerful specula-\\ntors like Chao Po-tao, as described in the latter part of the book, of\\nall sorts of political tricks to bring their opponents to ruin.\\n\\nhis mind, Tu Chu-chai looked into Shang Chung-li’s face for\\nhis answer.\\n\\nBut the old man looked perfectly at ease and raised three\\nfingers to stroke his beard.\\n\\n“what\\'s the secret?” Tu Chu-chai asked offhandedly, at the\\nsame time weighing all the possibilities in his mind. He had\\nalmost made up his mind to put them off and make good his\\nescape before he was persuaded to have a hand in their “plot.”\\nBut Chao Po-tao’s answer came as a shock:\\n\\n“Mr. Shang guarantees that the Northwestern Army will call\\na halt to their advance. Before the settlement for this month\\nis due government bonds will certainly rise again.”\\n\\nAlthough Chao Po-tao said this in a very low voice, the news\\nstruck Tu Chu-chai like a bolt from the blue, blotting out the\\ndin in the garden and the efforts of the two bands. He looked\\nat Shang Chung-li in amazement and asked doubtfully:\\n\\n“Are you so sure about it, then, Mr. Shang?”\\n\\n“Tt isn’t a matter of being sure: it’s a matter of making sure,”\\nreplied Shang Chung-li quietly, stroking his beard and smiling\\nat Chao Po-tao, Tu Chu-chai was still in the dark: the words\\n“making sure” puzzled him. In the ordinary way he had enough\\nconfidence in Shang Chung-li when he acted as a guarantor for\\nsome business transaction or other, but this case was out of the\\nordinary and so much would be at stake that he felt he had to\\nmake sure of everything. Hesitation and uncertainty were\\nwritten all over his goat-like face.\\n\\nChao Po-tao slapped his thigh and laughed, then leant across\\nand said quietly and seriously to Tu Chu-chai:\\n\\n“As I was saying, we have a secret. Everybody knows that\\nan army can be bribed to win, but nobody seems to have thought\\nof bribing it to lose a battle. What’s one defeat more or less\\nif you’re getting paid for it?”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai could scarcely believe his own ears. He racked\\nhis brains, stood up, stretched out his right hand to give Shang\\nChung-li the “thumbs up” sign, and burst into compliments:\\n\\n“Mr. Shang, my congratulations on your rare wisdom and\\nacumen! This is really wonderful!”\\n\\n“So you’ve made up your mind to go along with us, then.\\nHow about Wu Sun-fu? Will you speak to him as soon as pos-\\n\\nsible?” Chao Po-tao immediately urged, wanting to clinch the\\nmatter there and then.\\n\\nBut Shang Chung-li saw that Tu Chu-chai was still wavering\\nslightly. He knew that the latter, although he always had an\\neye for the main chance, was extremely wary, unlike Wu Sun-\\nfu who was fearless and energetic, so he qualified his remarks:\\n\\n“Although the person who deputizes for us in negotiations\\nwith the authorities on the other side has reached agreement\\non the terms, we wouldn’t say that it’s irrevocably fixed. Any\\ndeal with military men, you know, is necessarily touch-and-go,\\nas they may change their minds at the last minute. My idea\\nis, you’d better talk it over with Wu Sun-fu and get in touch\\nwith us later in the day.”\\n\\n“So you’ve agreed on terms?”\\n\\n“Yes: three hundred thousand dollars,’ Chao Po-tao answered\\nwith an air of impatience.\\n\\nTu Chu-chai stuck out his tongue, withdrew it, and grinnea,\\n\\n“No more, no less. We can\\'t afford more, and they won’t do\\nit for less. Thirty thousand dollars a mile. If they retreat ten\\nmiles, they’ll get three hundred thousand dollars,” said Shang\\nChung-li deliberately, fixing his cunning little eyes on Tu Chu-\\nchai’s goat-like face.\\n\\nFor a moment no one spoke; then Tu Chu-chai, the light of\\ndetermination in his eyes, looked first at Shang Chung-li and\\nthen at Chao Po-tao. Simultaneously, the three of them burst\\nout laughing, then put their heads together in an animated\\nconversation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the other side of a pond in front of the pavilion,\\nthree young men and two girls were sitting on a lawn in the\\nshade of some willows, debating hotly among themselves. The\\ngirls were not taking a very active part in the debate, but their\\ngiggles were enough to disturb the geese who were enjoying a\\nsiesta on the waters of the pond.\\n\\n“Let’s leave it at that,” said a lively cat-faced youngster. “Be\\nquiet, everybody, and I\\'ll run and fetch them.” He was Tu\\nChu-chai’s brother Hsueh-shih, an engineering college student.\\n\\n“Do you agree, Miss Lin?” Wu Chih-sheng asked Lin Pei-\\nshan, who pretended not to hear, but continued to hold Chang\\nSu-su’s hands and seesaw backwards and forwards.\\n\\nFan Po-wen, standing next to Lin Pei-shan, smiled non-\\ncommittally.\\n\\n“No object ons? Passed unanimously!” cried Tu Hsueh-shih\\nas he ran off towards the house. Wu Chih-sheng walked up and\\ndown with bent head for a while, stopped before Fan Po-wen and\\nchallenged him excitedly:\\n\\n“There\\'s another point. Will you take a bet on it?”\\n\\n“Let’s hear it. It may not be worth betting on.”\\n\\n“My point is: can Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan change their tem-\\nperaments?”\\n\\n“I won\\'t take a bet on that.”\\n\\n“1 will, Chih-sheng, but tell me first what you think. Will they\\nchange or won\\'t they?” interrupted Chang Su-su, letting go of\\nLin Pei-shan’s hand and coming over to Wu Chih-sheng.\\n\\n“wWhat’s the bet—a kiss?”\\n\\n“If I win, I certainly don’t want to kiss your ugly mug\\n\\nFan Po-wen and the others roared with laughter, except for\\nChang Su-su herself. who just stood there hopping on one foot. She\\nwas thinking about Huei-fang’s reserve and her staid expression.\\nIt was enough to exasperate you-and make you feel sorry for\\nher just to look at her. As for Ah-hsuan, although he was\\nfairly good-looking, he was rather scatter-brained — sometimes\\nhe seemed bright enough, but at other times he was terribly\\nmuddle-headed. Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan were two monuments\\nto the educative influence of the late Old Mr. Wu and his\\nBook of Rewards and Punishments. It made her feel uncom-\\nfortable to think about them and she forgot all about the bet.\\nJust then Tu Hsueh-shih ran back with two men in tow: Prof.\\nLi Yu-ting and Mr. Chiu Chun, Wu Sun-fu’s legal adviser.\\n\\nFrom the hexagonal pavilion on the artificial hill opposite, the\\nlaughter of Chao Po-tao, Shang Chung-li and Tu Chu-chai carried\\ndown to the lawn. Li Yu-ting looked up at them, then tugged\\nat Chiu Chun’s arm and whispered:\\n\\n“Look! The Big Three of the financial world. What do you\\nthink they are up to now?”\\n\\nChiu Chun smiled and was going to answer, when Wu Chih-\\n\\np\\n\\nsheng’s voice broke in:\\n“Mr. Chiu Chun and Prof. Li, we want your opinion... .\\nSpeak frankly, as I’ve got a bet on with Fan Po-wen: Can a\\n\\nman protect his national interests and his class interests at the\\nsame time? Is there a conflict between the two?’\\n\\n“Mr. Chiu and Prof. Li, don’t be afraid to state your views\\nsquarely. This is very important, as Wu Chih-sheng and Fan\\nPo-wen have a bet on it,’ Tu Hsueh-shih put in emphatically,\\nglancing at Lin Pei-shan, who tried to look indifferent. Squat-\\nting down, she began picking up fallen rose petals and arranging\\nthem in the character wen.\\n\\nChiu Chun shook his head modestly, so Li Yu-ting spoke up\\nfirst:\\n\\n“That all depends on the social status of the man concerned.”\\n\\n“Yes, we’ve had examples of that. Suppose, in view of the\\ndepression in the silk industry, Wu Sun-fu said to his workers:\\n‘Our production-costs are so high that we can’t compete with\\nJapanese silk producers and our silk industry’ll be ruined. To\\ncut the cost of production we must cut your wages. For the\\nsake of our national interests, you’ll have to bear up and be\\ncontent with lower wages.’ The workers would reply: ‘The\\ncost of living’s so high that we don’t get enough to eat as it is.\\nIf you cut our wages any more, we\\'re done for. You mill-owners\\nhave plenty of money and never know what starvation is. If\\nyou want to look after our national interests, you\\'ll have to put\\nup with a cut in your profits.” So you see that there is some-\\nthing to be said for both sides, but on both sides there is a clash\\nbetween national and class interests.”\\n\\n“Of course, starvation is no joke...” began Li Yu-ting, then\\nhesitated and raised a hand to scratch his head. Chang Su-su\\nlooked hard at him, but he was not conscious of it. There was\\nsilence as everybody waited for him to finish the sentence.\\nAcross the pond, the pavilion echoed with another gust of laughter.\\nLi Yu-ting looked up with a start and then went on to finish\\nwhat he was saying:\\n\\n“On the other hand, capitalists must make a profit. No profit,\\nno business!”\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng laughed exultantly and turned to Fan Po-wen:\\n\\n“There now! What did I say? This is just what I expected\\nfrom Prof. Li. My dear poet, you’ve lost one bet already. Now\\nfor the other one. If you\\'ll just state your side of the case. ...\\nSu-su, see that Pei-shan doesn’t run away.”\\n\\nFan Po-wen smiled icily but remained silent, so Tu Hsueh-\\nshih jumped in and spoke for him:\\n\\n“The workers put in a demand for higher wages. The boss\\nsays: ‘If you want higher wages, you’d better go and work some-\\nwhere else. I can easily get someone to replace you.’ But the\\nworkers refuse to go and insist on their demand for higher\\nwages. ... There’s a problem for our legal adviser.”\\n\\n“Both capital and labour are under contract. Neither can\\nforce the other to do anything against their will.”\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng and the others laughed and even Fan Po-wen\\njoined in. Lin Pei-shan, who had been squatting on the ground\\nand pretending not to take any notice, sprang up and was about\\nto make her escape, when Wu Chih-sheng and Chang Su-su\\nblocked her way, crying:\\n\\n“Now, now. Don’t run away! The poet’s absolutely defeated\\nand you must settle his account for him, otherwise we\\'ll take\\nour case to the lawyer here. Tu Hsueh-shih, you’re our guaran-\\ntor and you must fulfil your obligations.”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan giggled but refused to speak. At the first op-\\nportunity, she slipped under Chang Su-su\\'s arm and raced away\\nalong a parti-coloured cobbled path, skirting the pond and turn-\\ning right. With a surprised “oh!” Chang Su-su followed in\\npursuit. Fan Po-wen, holding Wu Chih-sheng by the shoulder,\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Don’t get excited. Just wait. Tu Hsueh-shih’s going to pass\\njudgement.”\\n\\n“What? A guarantor be a judge? Simply isn’t done. Besides,\\nwe didn’t agree on this beforehand.”\\n\\n“It was agreed: ‘If the lawyer\\'s or the professor’s views\\nprove inconclusive, Tu Hsueh-shih shall arbitrate.’ Now I con-\\nsider both their views ambiguous. It isn\\'t fair just to say that\\nI\\'m the loser.”\\n\\n“Both views are irresponsible and superficial, since they didn\\'t\\ngive any reasoning,” broke in Tu Hsueh-shih, his cat-like face\\nsuddenly very stern.\\n\\nNot only was Wu Chih-sheng surprised at this, but the lawyer\\nand the professor were also puzzled. Everybody clustered round\\nTu Hsueh-shih, waiting for him to go on.\\n\\n“All this talk about national interests, class interests and\\ncapital-and-labour contracts is a lot of nonsense — mere words.\\nI recognize only the state. And the helm of the state must be\\nin the firm grip of men of iron. What’s important is to get\\nthings done, not to theorize about them. No one should be\\npermitted to oppose these men of iron who rule the state. For\\ninstance, if Chinese silk can’t compete with Japanese silk, then\\nit’s the duty of the rulers to cut the workers’ wages on the one\\nhand and on the other to compel the Chinese capitalists to sell\\nat the lowest possible prices, so that Chinese silk can hold its\\nown against Japanese silk in the European and American markets.\\nIf the capitalists refuse to obey, then the state should confiscate\\ntheir factories.”\\n\\nTu Hsueh-shih concluded his speech abruptly, glaring around\\nand swaggering as if he were one of these “men of iron.”\\n\\nHis listeners smiled, but no one spoke. They heard Chang\\nSu-su and Lin Pei-shan giggling as they approached from the\\nclump of trees at the other end of the pond. Fan Po-wen looked\\nround at the sound of the voices, then clapped Tu Hsueh-shih on\\nthe shoulder and jeered:\\n\\n“Jolly good! But, unfortunately, you’re neither a capitalist nor\\na worker, still less a ‘man of iron hand.’ And what’s more, your\\nlittle speech was just as ‘superficial and without any reasoning’\\nas anything else. Please remember, my bet with Wu Chih-sheng\\nwasn’t about what should be done, but who could guess what\\nthe lawyer and the professor were going to say.... But let’s say\\nno more about this betting business—let’s call it a day.”\\n\\nWith this Fan Po-wen ran off to meet the girls.\\n\\n“Oh, no, my dear poet, you don’t get away with it as easily as\\nthat,” shouted Wu Chih-sheng, running after Fan Po-wen, while\\nthe lawyer and the professor stood there and laughed.\\n\\nJust as Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-sheng got up to Chang Su-\\nsu and Lin Pei-shan, they saw three men coming towards them:\\nChao Po-tao, Shang Chung-li and Tu Chu-chai. They were talk-\\ning in an undertone as they walked along, but, at the sight of\\nthe youngsters, they fell silent and turned aside without a word\\nalong the cobbled path towards the willow grove, at the same\\ntime making a detour on their way back to the house to avoid\\nbeing seen by Chiu Chun and Li Yu-ting. But Li Yu-ting’s sharp\\n\\neyes had spotted them and, tugging at the corner of Chiu Chun’s\\njacket, he said quietly:\\n\\n“Look, the Big Three of the financial world! See them?\\nSomething big in the air, by the look on their faces.”\\n\\n“Perhaps they’re worried about the ‘man of iron’ who’s just\\nbeen born in our midst!” replied Chiu Chun with a smile, and\\nLi Yu-ting laughed. Absorbed in his own thoughts, Tu Hsueh-\\nshih did not hear the quip meant for him.\\n\\n*\\n\\nOn the stone steps in front of the ceremonial hall Tu Chu-chai\\nran into a new arrival, a distant relative of the Wu family,\\nLu Kuang-shih by name, a stockbroker and assistant manager\\nof the Great Asia Trust Company. The moment he saw Tu\\nChu-chai he buttonholed him and whispered in his ear:\\n\\n“I\\'ve got a tip for you. The Central Army’s fighting better\\nnow, and government bonds will soon be up again. Strictly con-\\nfidential! But most people are still expecting a fall, and small\\nholders are anxious to sell out while they can. Why not make\\nthe most of this opportunity and buy up several hundred\\nthousand? I know you’ve only been going in for gold bars, but\\nnow you must try government bonds as well just this once. Go\\non, do yourself a bit of good while you\\'ve got the chance.”\\n\\nLu Kuang-shih may have given this tip with the best of in-\\ntentions, but it only scared Tu Chu-chai, who was contemplat-\\ning having a hand in the secret bull-company. As he listened,\\nhe paled and began to have misgivings: surely the news of\\nShang Chung-li’s plan hadn’t leaked out already? Or was the\\nCentral Army in fact getting the upper hand now? Were Chao\\nPo-tao and Shang Chung-li playing a shabby trick on him? Or\\nwas this man Lu Kuang-shih just rumour-mongering for his own\\nends? Tu Chu-chai was in a quandary and did not know what\\nto say. He tipped Chao Po-tao a wink—he had in fact only\\nmeant to look and see what his reactions were, but somehow\\nthe look turned into a wink. Even an old hand like him had\\nmade a blunder this time.\\n\\nFortunately, he was rescued from his embarrassment by the\\narrival of the butler Kao Sheng, who hurried over to him and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Mr. Tu, the master would like to see you. He’s in the\\nlibrary.”\\n\\nRelieved, Tu Chu-chai answered “Thank you” and turned to\\nLu Kuang-shih:\\n\\n“Excuse me a moment. I’ll be seeing you later. Please make\\nyourself at home in the dining-room. —Kao Sheng, get Mr. Lu\\nsome tea.”\\n\\nHaving got rid of Lu Kuang-shih, he and the other two went\\nout into the garden again and found a quiet corner, where they\\nheld another whispered conference, their faces lighting up with\\npleasure.\\n\\n“Well, I’m off to see Sun-fu. Po-tao, you’ll deal with Lu\\nKuang-shih; you can find him in the dining-room. Mr. Shang,\\nyou\\'ll get things straightened out with the man from the North,”\\nsaid Tu Chu-chai finally, and the three men went their different\\nways.\\n\\nWhen he reached the library Tu Chu-chai was surprised to find\\nWu Sun-fu sitting there with his brows knitted in a deep frown.\\nHe had not looked so upset as this even when Old Mr. Wu had\\ndied the night before. Directly Tu Chu-chai sat down, and be-\\nfore he could say a word, Wu Sun-fu tossed over a sheet of paper.\\nIt was a telegram, and it read: “Unrest among peasants, troops\\ninadequate, situation critical, advise measures, urgent, Fei, 7th.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai paled. Though he had not so much property at\\nstake in their home town as Wu Sun-fu had, it was inevitable\\nthat he should feel upset to hear that the place where he had\\nhis ancestral home and graveyard was now in danger. Laying\\ndown the telegram, he glanced at Wu Sun-fu and said briefly:\\n\\n“What do you propose to do, then?”\\n\\n“I\\'ll do what’s humanly possible. It’s lucky the old man\\nand Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan got out two days ago, otherwise I\\nshouldn’t know what to do with them. At the moment I’ve only\\na pawnshop, a local bank and a rice-mill marooned there, and\\nalthough they’re worth more than a little, they’re not a matter\\nof life or death.... You ask what I propose to do. Well, I’ve\\nwired my agent Fei Little Beard to put my ready cash in a safe\\nplace and move out what goods he can from the business prem-\\nises. Of course, it may be that it’s only a false alarm and that\\nthings will settle down again soon. That garrison is under\\n\\nstrength and something ought to be done about it; we should\\nsend a joint telegram to the provincial government to send down\\nthe security troops immediately to restore order.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu did not look quite like his usual self. He had\\nbeen rambling on before he came to the point—the wire to the\\nprovincial government. He handed Tu Chu-chai the draft which\\nhe had made and pressed the bell on the wall behind him.\\n\\nThe door opened softly and two men entered, the butler Kao\\nSheng and Mo Kan-cheng, the chief clerk in the factory.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu frowned even more when he saw that Mo Kan-\\ncheng had come without being sent for and snapped sternly:\\n\\n“TC didn’t send for you. I told you that you meedn’t come here\\ntoday, but stay and look after the factory. It’s more important\\nfor you to remain there.”\\n\\nThe old clerk was frightened out of his wits by this reproof.\\nHe simply answered “Yes, yes” and stood rooted to the ground.\\n\\n“Has anything gone wrong in the factory?” asked Wu Sun-fu\\noffhandedly, relaxing his features. He was not thinking of the\\nfactory, but of his home town and the threat of a riot among\\nthe peasants. Mo Kan-cheng’s tremulous reply came as a sur-\\nprise:\\n\\n“Things in the factory are none too pleasant, sir... .\\n\\n“What? Out with it! What’s the matter?”\\n\\n“Perhaps it isn’t all that important, but . . . but I don’t like the\\nway things are shaping. We haven’t yet announced the wage-cut,\\nbut the women have somehow found out about it. Since this\\nmorning they’ve been... well, they’ve been going slow. So I\\ncame to ask you, sir... what should we do about it?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s face suddenly darkened and he sat speechless,\\nthe purplish pimples on his face turning livid with rage. All of\\na sudden he sprang up and bellowed like a madman, cursing the\\nwomen workers and cursing Mo Kan-cheng and his subordinates:\\n\\n“So they’re going slow now, are they, the bitches? T’ll show\\nthem a thing or two! And what have you lot in the office been\\ndoing about it all this time? Huh! all you\\'re fit for is loafing\\nabout and skylarking and flirting with the girls! Perhaps it was\\none of your fools who let on about the wage-cut.”\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng just stood there hanging his head and hardly\\ndaring to breathe. His helpless manner served only to fan the\\n\\n”\\n\\nflames of Wu Sun-fu’s rage: his right hand on his hip and his\\nleft clenched and poised on the edge of the steel desk, he glared\\nround the room with eyes ablaze as if looking for something to\\nfix his teeth into. He suddenly discovered the butler Kao Sheng\\nstanding stiffly in the corner, and immediately turned on him\\nfuriously:\\n\\n“What are you doing here?”\\n\\n“I just came in when you rang, sir.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu remembered the telegram and realized that Tu\\nChu-chai was still there, sitting on the other side of the table.\\nBy now he had glanced through the draft and was engrossed\\nin his own thoughts, his eyes closed and a cigar jutting from the\\ncorner of his mouth.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu picked up the telegram and handed it to Kao Sheng,\\nwaved him away and said:\\n\\n“Send this off at once—the quicker the better.”\\n\\nHe sat down on the chromium-plated swivel-chair, scribbled a\\nfew words on a slip of paper, then crumpled it up and threw\\nit into the waste-paper basket. He hesitated, his pen poised.\\n\\nTu Chu-chai opened his eyes, and when he saw Wu Sun-fu’s\\nperplexity he said softly:\\n\\n“Sun-fu, I think the smooth way is better than the rough.”\\n\\n“That’s what I was thinking .. .” replied Wu Sun-fu, a little\\ncalmer now. Rolling his pen between his fingers, he turned to Mo\\nKan-cheng:\\n\\n“Kan-cheng, sit down and tell me all about what happened\\nthis morning.”\\n\\nThe old clerk, who was quite used to Wu Sun-fu’s moods, re-\\nalized that he could now speak up boldly and that there was no\\nlonger any need to keep up the pretence of terrified helpless-\\nness, so he sat down at once in an easy-chair beside the desk\\nand began slowly:\\n\\n“This morning at about nine o’clock, forewoman No. 2, Wang\\nChin-chen, ran into my office to report that Yao Chin-feng in Row\\nNo. 12 had made a mistake and was being insubordinate about\\nit. Then forewoman No. 9 Hsueh Pao-chu asked Yao Chin-feng\\nto come along to my office. Then what should happen but that\\nall the women in Row No. 12 switched off their machines and\\nwere backing up Yao Chin-feng by making a disturbance... .\\n\\nI was just going along to see what I could do to stop it, when\\nI heard a lot of shouting and screaming, and up came Hsueh\\nPao-chu dragging Yao Chin-feng along with her. By this time\\nall the women had switched off their machines... .”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu frowned, looked sharply at Mo Kan-cheng, and\\ncut him short impatiently:\\n\\n“Make it brief. Just tell me how things stand now.”\\n\\n“At the moment only a small proportion of the five hundred\\nand twenty filatures are running ...and the women who are\\nstill working are only spoiling the cocoons.”\\n\\nAt this Wu Sun-fu growled angrily, sprang up, dropped back\\ninto his chair, and asked quickly:\\n\\n“What’s the reason for this go-slow?”\\n\\n“They’re demanding that we sack Hsueh Pao-chu.”\\n\\n“Why’s that?”\\n\\n“They say she hit Yao Chin-feng. ... And they are demand-\\ning a cost-of-living allowance, too. They made the same demand\\nonce before when the price of rice went up to twenty dollars\\nper picul and now they’re bringing it up again.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu snorted and turned to Tu Chu-chai. “Chu-chai,\\nI can tell you it’s no fun running a silk factory. When rice goes\\nup, the workers demand a cost-of-living allowance; but when the\\nprice of silk drops, we make a loss—but no one makes us a silk\\nallowance! Right: go back, Kan-cheng, and tell them this: if\\nthey want a cost-of-living allowance, I will close down my\\nfactory.”\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng said “yes” but his little rat’s eyes stared at Wu\\nSun-fu with great embarrassment.\\n\\n“What now?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir...er... excuse me, but I’m afraid that if you tell\\nthem you’re going to close down the factory just at this moment,\\nit might cause trouble... .”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“This time, the women seem to be more united, as if it’s all\\nbeen arranged beforehand.”\\n\\n“Pooh! What are you—a lot of zombies? You haven’t a clue\\nwhat’s going on until something happens, and then you come\\ncrying to me. Forewoman No. 2, Wang Chin-chen, and the over-\\nseer Pockmarked Li both get my special bonus, don’t they? Yet\\n\\nthey don’t seem to be doing much in the way of keeping an\\neye on the women. You’d think I had too much money and\\nnothing to spend it on, the way I keep feeding those dogs for\\nnothing.”\\n\\nBy now Mo Kan-cheng had plucked up courage again and spoke\\nup. “They do do their best, both of them. They’re continually\\nwatching and listening to see what the women are up to, but\\nyou’d think they had the word ‘informer’ written all over them:\\neverywhere they turn they come up against a brick wall and\\nthey find it difficult to ferret out any information at all. I’m\\ntelling you, sir: you’d think the women were possessed. the way\\nthey go on. Yao Chin-feng used to be quite obedient, but now\\nshe’s one of the ringleaders. All you hear in the workshop now\\nis: ‘The last time we demanded a cost-of-living allowance, you\\nsoft-soaped us with false promises, but this time we really mean\\nbusiness! Don’t you dare tell us you’re going to cut our wages.\\nWe want a cost-of-living allowance. D’you hear? A_ cost-of-\\nliving allowance!’ I hear they’re having trouble in other factories,\\ntoo. You’d think the workers were all possessed by devils.”\\n\\n“Possessed by devils, eh? Ha, ha! I can tell you what sort of\\ndevils, too: high cost of living and hunger. But there’s another\\ndevil, a much more terrible one than that: world depression and\\nslump. .. .”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu broke into loud, cynical laughter, pain and despair\\nwritten all over his purplish face; but he quickly recovered his\\ncustomary firmness and determination. Gesticulating excitedly,\\nhe went on, his lips twisted in a savage smile.\\n\\n“Very well, you devils—we’ll see! Think I’m done for, eh?\\nOh, no! We\\'ll have a go first!—Now, Kan-cheng, how did the\\nwomen come to Know about the wage-cut? One of your people\\nin the office must have let on about it!”\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng was taken aback by this question, and cold\\nshivers ran down his spine. He hesitated, then a sudden idea\\nstruck him, and he said furtively:\\n\\n“T suspect Tu Wei-yueh. That young man has gone daft just\\nlately. All he thinks about all day is Chu Kuei-ying, one of the\\ngirls in Row 19. People are always seeing him going in and out\\n\\nof her house... .\\n\\nThe door suddenly opened, and the voice of Fu-fang inter-\\nrupted Mo Kan-cheng in the middle of what he was saying.\\n\\n“Sun-fu, the men from the International Undertakers have ar-\\nrived with the funeral things, but I don’t think the coffin is\\nquite good enough,” said Fu-fang, pausing in the doorway and\\nlooking in at her husband sitting opposite to her brother.\\n\\n“Hold on; Pl be with you in a minute. Chu-chai, could you\\njust go and have a look at it?”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai, waving a hand, spoke to his wife through the\\ncloud of cigar-smoke:\\n\\n“We shan’t be long. It’s early yet. If the coffin’s no good, we\\ncan change it in plenty of time.”\\n\\n“Rarly? It’s a quarter past twelve already and the visitors are\\nhaving lunch.”\\n\\nSo saying, Fu-fang went away again. Wu Sun-fu turned to\\nMo Kan-cheng and snapped out his orders:\\n\\n“Now, go straight back to the factory and put up a notice an-\\nnouncing a paid half-holiday this afternoon in memory of the\\nlate Old Mr. Wu. See to it that the women go home—we don’t\\nwant them staying in the factory and making trouble. But you\\nand your men will have some special work to do this afternoon:\\nyou will go about among the women, work on them separately\\nand break their unity. You’ve got until this evening to get the\\njob done. Meanwhile, you can call in policemen from the Bureau\\nof Public Safety to guard the factory, and send a report to the\\nBureau of Social Affairs about the trouble. As for that fellow\\nTu Wei-yueh, send him round to me this evening. Got that?\\nAll right, then, make yourself scarce.”\\n\\nHaving got rid of Mo Kan-cheng, Wu Sun-fu stood up, drew a\\ndeep sigh, and muttered to himself:\\n\\n“Damn this factory business! I should have had a bank in-\\nstead of a factory right from the start. If I had, I could have\\nhad something by now to show for it, with my ability and capi-\\ntal. The Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank only had a\\nhundred thousand dollars when they started up, and look at\\nthem now... .”\\n\\nHe paused and stroked his chin, then pulled himself together\\nand smacked his right fist into his left hand.\\n\\n“No! I must carry on! There are not many of China’s na-\\ntional industries left: you can count them, on the fingers of one\\nhand. And the silk industry is especially important to the future\\n\\nof the nation. ... If only the country were something like a\\ncountry and the government were something like a government,\\nChinese industry could really do well in the future... . Chu-\\n\\nchai, I’ve got an idea, but there’s no time to tell you about it\\njust now. Let’s go and see the coffin they’ve sent first.”\\n\\n“Just a minute. I’ve got something important to tell you, too.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai took the cigar-stub out of his mouth and stood\\nup. He moved closer to Wu Sun-fu and told him the whole\\nstory of the “plot” devised by Chao Po-tao and Shang Chung-li.\\nWhen he came to the end, he asked, “Now, Sun-fu, do you think\\nthere’s a catch in it? If you won’t go in, I won’t either.”\\n\\n“A million each? Half the sum cash down today?” Wu Sun-\\nfu asked rather non-committally and with a straight face.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s their idea. Chao Po-tao’s plan is this: this after-\\nnoon, he’ll sell out three million short to bring the price down\\neven more... .”\\n\\n“Yes, that would certainly do the trick. There may be a drop\\nof two or three dollars. Then we cover, I suppose?”\\n\\n“No, not yet. In tomorrow’s first session, we’ll sell another—\\nfive million short, in Chao Po-tao’s name.”\\n\\n“Oh! Then the slump will set in. If Chao Po-tao, the famous\\nbull, sells, the small-fry holders will panic and rush to sell out.\\nThen, of course, when people see the market is falling, a lot of\\nnew bears will be coming on the scene.”\\n\\n“Exactly. So we\\'ll wait until tomorrow’s afternoon session\\nbefore we begin covering. We\\'ll cover slowly and in small\\nlots, here and there, so as not to attract attention. When we\\nget to within a few days of the settlement, we should have col-\\nlected at least fifty million, .. .”\\n\\n“And then the news of the Northwestern Army’s retreat will\\nsuddenly break and there’ll be an uproar!”\\n\\n“exactly. Then all the small-fry will rush to buy and turn\\nbulls. With the settlement and the Dragon-boat Festival only a\\nfew days off, the bears will also be anxious to cover, faced as\\nthey will be with a rapid rise.”\\n\\n“Then we\\'ll unload our fifty million, and they’ll look on us\\nas their saviours!”\\n\\nAt this the two of them roared with laughter together, their\\neyes gleaming with delight and excitement.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu stopped and said briskly, “Done! Let’s go in and\\nwin! But we are making it so easy for the big bull Chao Po-\\ntao to take advantage of this deal, and make a packet out of it\\nfor himself. We must put forward our own terms, in addition\\nto what we shall gain on the bonds. Let’s go and find him and\\ntalk it over.”\\n\\nWith these words they left the library. The “great scheme”\\nwhich Wu Sun-fu had been turning over in his mind for some\\ntime had now flooded his entire consciousness.\\nIt\\n\\nIT was two o\\'clock in the afternoon. The sky was cloudy and\\nthe heat oppressive. The International Undertakers had not\\nyet delivered the coffin ordered by Fu-fang—one with a thick\\npane of glass let into the lid so that Old Mr. Wu’s remains could\\nbe seen. The two sisters, Fu-fang and Huei-fang, had rejected\\nthe first coffin delivered as unsatisfactory and ordered another,\\nso the shrouding ceremony had to be put back one hour. Mean-\\nwhile they kept hurrying the undertakers up both by telephone\\nand by special messengers. The Wus were all ready and were\\nonly waiting for the arrival of the coffin from the undertakers\\nto complete the ceremony.\\n\\nMany of the mourners had already gone and there remained\\nonly a few relatives and close friends and a number of peo-\\nple who had no other calls on their time. They were chatting\\nin scattered groups in the cool of the garden and waiting patient-\\nly for the shrouding.\\n\\nThe dining-room was now deserted except for a handful of\\nservants clearing away the beer and lemonade bottles and\\nsweeping up the litter of fruit peel on the floor. As they worked,\\nthey grumbled among themselves:\\n\\n“Our master’s a hasty one and no mistake! He even tries\\nto rush an important thing like his father’s funeral in one day.\\nYou just can’t do things like that!”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s his quick temper makes him like that. Kao Sheng\\nsays he was in a filthy temper in the library this morning—\\nfrightened Mr. Mo from the factory out of his wits, he did! Old\\nMr. Wu was lucky to get out when he did: another couple of\\ndays and it would have been too late. I hear a telegram came\\nthis morning saying that the peasants are up in arms down there\\nin the country. That’s why he’s in such a state, I suppose.”\\n\\nThis remark was made by Li Kuei. He had originally been\\na footman to Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s parents and, after their death.\\nhad come over to the Wu household. If the thirty-odd servants\\nin the household could be said to have party affiliations, then\\nLi Kuei was on the side of his mistress.\\n\\n“They’ve spent more than five hundred and sixty dollars to-\\nday on cars and tips alone. And the guests got through thirty\\ndozen bottles of beer and lemonade,” said another servant,\\nchanging the subject.\\n\\n“I expect the tip for us will be at least a thousand dollars,”\\nsaid Li Kuei. At the words “a thousand dollars” everyone cheered\\nup, but in a moment their despondency returned, for they knew\\nfrom experience that the tip would be divided up among the\\nservants according to their grades and that even if it were\\ndivided up equally, it would have to go round among more than\\na hundred when you include the ushers, musicians, masters of\\nceremonies and all the others hired for the occasion, so that\\nin the end each one would get only a miserable little sum. At\\nthis prospect they all became half-hearted in their efforts and\\nwere even more lethargic than before the tip was mentioned.\\nThey were just about to give vent to their resentment again when\\n‘someone came in.\\n\\nIt was Fan Po-wen, looking no more cheerful than the de-\\nspondent servants. He stopped in the middle of the room,\\nwheeled round, and muttered to himself:\\n\\n“Why, there isn’t a soul here! I say, Li Kuei, have you seen\\nMiss Pei-shan anywhere?”\\n\\nBut he was off without waiting for a reply. He went through\\nthe other section of the dining-room, out on to the veranda,\\nthen into the drawing-room looking round with wide eyes. The\\nroom was rather quiet just now, and he found none of the ladies\\nthere. Several women servants were keeping vigil, sitting on a\\nbench against the wall and looking like a row of black clay\\nfigures. The body of Old Mr. Wu was lying on its bier in the\\ncentre of the room, heaped about with mounds of flowers among\\nwhich large blocks of ice glittered coldly.\\n\\nFan Po-wen shivered in spite of himself, quickly pushed\\nthrough the white curtains out on to the stone steps in front\\n\\nof the house. He drew a deep breath and looked up at the sky,\\na cold feeling of loneliness and desolation flooding his poetic soul.\\n\\nBy the archway over the stone steps the funeral musicians\\nwere dozing and hugging their instruments. After hours of\\nhard work they were now snatching forty winks while they\\ncould and saving their energy for a final effort at the shrouding\\nceremony.\\n\\nFan Po-wen found everything an eyesore: it was all so con-\\nventional, vulgar and disgusting that he could hardly contain\\nhimself. Just then, Wu Chih-sheng came running up the asphalt\\ndrive full of excitement, as if he had made a discovery. Seeing\\nFan Po-wen standing there alone, he grasped him by the arm\\nand dragged him off with him. Following him absently, Fan\\nPo-wen asked, “Have you seen Pei-shan anywhere?”\\n\\n“1\\'ll tell you about it later. Just now I want you to come\\nalong and see something—quite an eye-opener, I assure you!”\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng led Fan Po-wen through a lilac grove to a\\nquiet corner on the east side of the garden, where there was a\\ngreenhouse, covered over now with a mat awning. To the left\\nof the greenhouse were three foreign-style rooms with open\\nwindows hung on the outside with patterned Japanese screens\\nof fine bamboo. From behind the screens came gusts of laughter.\\n\\n“Why, this is a billiard-room. I don’t play billiards, you\\nknow,” said Fan Po-wen, shaking his head, but Wu Chih-sheng\\nimmediately put his hand over Fan Po-wen’s mouth and whis-\\npered in his ear, “Be quiet. Just have a look, and you\\'ll see\\nwhat kind of billiards they’re playing!”\\n\\nThe two of them tiptoed up to one of the windows and peeped\\nin. A scene of revelry met their eyes. The society girl Hsu\\nMan-li, her feet bare, was dancing gracefully on a billiard-table.\\nHer arms outstretched and one leg held high in the air, so that\\nher whole weight was supported on the point of the other foot,\\nshe pirouetted rapidly on the smooth, soft baize, the hem of her\\ndress flaring out like a parasol and revealing her soft white\\nthighs and her round hips sheathed in pink silk underwear.\\nChu Yin-chiu, Sun Chi-jen, Wang Ho-fu and Chen Chun-yi were\\nsitting on high stools by the billiard-table, clapping their hands\\nand laughing hilariously, while Chou Chung-wei brandished a\\nbilliard cue as if he were conducting an orchestra. Suddenly,\\n\\nHsu Man-li leapt lightly on to the next billiard-table. This feat\\nbrought a roar of applause from the onlookers, but just then she\\nseemed to slip. She twisted and swayed as if she was going\\nto fall, but Col. Lei dashed forward and caught her in time,\\nhugging her to his chest.\\n\\n“No cheating! You shouldn’t take advantage of her like that!”\\nprotested Tang Yun-shan, balancing Hsu Man-li’s high-heeled\\nblack satin shoes on his bald head.\\n\\nThen a riot ensued. The men and the girl struggled together,\\nlaughing and shouting hysterically. The four onlookers jumped\\ndown from their stools and joined in.\\n\\nOutside the window Fan Po-wen pulled Wu Chih-sheng aside,\\nfrowned and said scornfully, ‘““What’s so unusual about that?\\nIs that all you dragged me over here to see? I’ve seen worse\\nthan that!”\\n\\n“But aren’t these people the ‘pillars of society’ who are always\\nholding forth on propriety between the sexes?”\\n\\n“Huh! Don\\'t be so naive. They may talk about morals, but\\nthey still have to dance their death dance. Do you know what’s\\nmeant by the death dance? Well, as the villages become more\\nand more bankrupt, the abnormal development of the cities be-\\ncomes faster, the price of rice and gold soars, the civil war\\nbecomes fiercer, the unrest among the peasantry more wide-\\nspread—and the death dance of the rich becomes wilder. There’s\\nnothing new about it. Why should we be watching it? We\\'d\\nbe better employed looking for Pei-shan and the others.”\\n\\nFan Po-wen turned to go, but Wu Chih-sheng pulled him back.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the billiard-room had become the scene of another\\nperformance. Somebody was croaking a song. Wu Chih-sheng\\nhauled Fan Po-wen back to the window. Hsu Man-li was still\\ndancing on the table, this time not so fast. The short, fat man\\nChou Chung-wei was squatting on the floor and hopping about\\nlike a frog, clicking his tongue and balancing Hsu Man-li’s shoes\\non his head. The singer turned out to be Col. Lei; with his\\nchest sticking out and his head thrown back, he could not have\\nlooked more earnest and serious if he had been singing a\\nmarching-song.\\n\\nWith a glance over his shoulder at Fan Po-wen, Wu Chih-\\nsheng darted to the door of the billiard-room, jerked aside the\\nbamboo screen, burst into the room and shouted:\\n\\n“Bravo! The latest amusement—the death dance!”\\n\\nThe dancing, singing and hopping stopped dead, and the rev-\\nellers stood transfixed with surprise. Just at that moment the\\nsilence was shattered by the mingled sounds of sonas, flutes\\nand trumpets as the funeral musie struck up: the shrouding had\\nat last begun. Chu Yin-chiu jumped up and led the way out,\\nshouting as he ran:\\n\\n“Come on, everybody! They’ve started.”\\n\\nThey all rushed out behind him, including Chou Chung-wei,\\nwho had forgotten that he still had the lady’s shoes on his head,\\nwhile Hsu Man-li stamped her bare feet on the billiard-table and\\nshouted for help. The colonel, seeing an opportunity of dis-\\nplaying his gallantry, snatched her up in his arms and followed\\nthe crowd as far as the greenhouse, where he retrieved her\\ndainty little shoes for her.\\n\\n*\\n\\nWhen the party from the billiard-room reached the house they\\nfound the front steps packed with people. The trees were hung\\nwith white paper lanterns which shed a mournful yellowish\\nlight amid the greenery and the sky was so overcast that it\\nseemed like evening.\\n\\nThe trumpets were hooting and screeching away so weirdly\\nthat they set one’s teeth on edge. An attendant with a large\\nbundle of burning incense in his hand, seeing Chu Yin-chiu’s\\nparty crowding up, began distributing a stick to each of them.\\n\\nFan Po-wen took one and immediately let it drop to the ground,\\nthen, seeing a gap in the crowd, he pushed his way in. Wu\\nChih-sheng followed him, brandishing his incense-stick to clear a\\nway.\\n\\nTang Yun-shan craned his neck to look round, then winked at\\nSun Chi-jen over his shoulder and said, “What are we waiting\\nhere for?”\\n\\n“What about going back to the other place?”\\n\\n“No, but we can-cut through the asphalt path round the back\\nway to the dining-room,” suggested Chou Chung-wei, looking to\\nWang Ho-fu and Chen Chun-yi for support.\\n\\n“Have you noticed? Someone\\'s missing: the colonel and the\\nyoung lady!” said Chu Yin-chiu with a wink, but his voice was\\ndrowned by an even louder blast of funeral music. Chen Chun-\\nyi pulled him along as he followed Chou Chung-wei and the\\nothers when they cut through the veranda in front of the dining-\\nroom. As they passed the trellis with the banksia roses they\\nspotted Col. Lei and Hsu Man-li emerging from a grove and\\nhurrying towards the funeral hall.\\n\\nThey found the dining-room empty, as they had expected,\\nand the door leading to the funeral hall was closed. The moment\\nChou Chung-wei opened it a little he was greeted by a combined\\nblast of trumpets, sonas and flutes, reinforced by the weeping\\nand wailing of the mourners. He was surprised to find right\\nunder his nose a coffin and a heap of funeral paraphernalia. He\\nquickly closed the door again and turned and shook his head.\\n\\n“I think we’d better stay where we are. What does it matter\\nif there’s a wall in between?”\\n\\nAs he said this, he collected all the incense-sticks and without\\nceremony stuck them into a decorative Foochow lacquered vase\\non the table, then sank his bulky frame into a sofa. For a while\\neverybody was silent.\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu, sitting opposite Chou Chung-wei, puffed away\\nfuriously at a Garrick, his eyes closed as if he were thinking\\nhard. Then he suddenly opened them at Chen Chun-yi and\\nsaid, “If people can’t collect their accounts by the end of the\\nquarter, it’s all because of the war. Everybody’s in the same\\nboat. Surely the local banks you deal with can help you out a\\nbit?”\\n\\n“As a matter of fact, I’ve been to see them about it time and\\nagain. They only say money is tight and so on and so forth.\\nIt’s infuriating. ... I think I might approach Tu Chu-chai later\\non; perhaps he’ll help me out,” answered Chen Chun-yi with a\\nsigh. He saw in his mind’s eye the ugly, half-dead faces of the\\nbank managers who had refused him loans, and beside them the\\nbland goat-like face of Tu Chu-chai; he felt the latter held a\\nray of hope for him. But Chu Yin-chiu said coldly and scepti-\\ncally, with a shake of his head:\\n\\n“Tu Chu-chai?—Oh!”\\n\\n“Yes, and what of it? Don’t you think there’s any hope\\nthere? I only need a small sum—even a hundred and twenty\\nor thirty thousand dollars would do,” said Chen Chun-yi hastily,\\nwatching Chu Yin-chiu’s face. Before the latter could answer,\\nChou Chung-wei chimed in:\\n\\n“A hundred and twenty or thirty thousand? You call that\\na small sum? I need only fifty or sixty thousand, and I can’t\\neven get that. Whenever we factory owners call on the bankers,\\nall we get is scowls. But that’s not surprising, really, when\\nyou come to think about it: they naturally prefer to use their\\ncapital to buy government securities. One day’s work on the\\nExchange and they’ve made a hundred thousand dollars. And\\nthat’s mere chicken-feed to them.”\\n\\n“That’s perfectly true,” said Tang Yun-shan. “You couldn’t\\nsay fairer than that. And that’s why I always say that the root\\nof the trouble is that the government’s off the rails. Once it\\ngets on the right track, all government bonds will go to devel-\\noping industry. Then finance and industry will really co-\\noperate, which is more than they do now, when all the financiers\\nare interested in is profits. But to bring stability into politics\\nyou can’t merely depend upon military men. The men who run\\nthe industries, the industrial capitalists, should bring their in-\\nfluence to bear upon politics.”\\n\\nTang Yun-shan was never slow in seizing an opportunity of\\nmaking propaganda for the party he supported. He had always\\nshown solicitude about industrialists, big or small, and known\\nhow to deal with them. Even though his arguments had been\\nheard again and again, he never tired of harping upon them\\nonce more whenever the opportunity presented itself. And his\\ninvariable conclusion was: “Our Mr. Wang Ching-wei* is\\nstrongly advocating democracy and genuinely wants to devel-\\nop China’s industries. China has plenty of money for industry,\\nbut military expenses eat it up.” As Wu Sun-fu shared this\\npoint of view, a close friendship had lately sprung up between\\nhim and Tang Yun-shan.\\n\\nThey had to cut short their conversation when from the funeral\\nhall there came an ear-splitting din of funeral music and wail-\\n\\n* Wang Ching-wei, see footnote, p. 47.\\n\\ning, punctuated by a loud hammering on some wooden object.\\nThe noise continued, but gradually they got used to it and picked\\nup the thread of their conversation again.\\n\\nDistracted by worries about the financial settlement coming\\nwith the Dragon-boat Festival, Chu Yin-chiu regarded Tang Yun-\\nshan’s ideas as sound, but they did not really have any bearing\\non his own personal problem, which was simply how to carry\\nover his security loans so that he would not have to sell his\\nsilk at a painfully cheap price, and so that he would be able\\nto keep his factory running at the same time. In a word, his\\nproblem was to obtain ready cash. Though his debts amounted\\nto over a hundred thousand dollars, he had in hand two hundred\\nbales of fine and coarse silk and a large stock of cocoons. On\\nbalance, he was not in debt. His creditors had no need to be\\nworried about their money, but you’d think he hadn’t a penny\\nto his name the way they kept pressing for repayment. ‘\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu felt irked as he thought about all this. He was\\nsure the bankers had a particular aversion to him, and Tang\\nYun-shan’s ideas didn’t help him solve his problems. He snorted\\nand said icily:\\n\\n“Mr. Tang, whatever you may say, I’m sure the people who\\ngo in for gold and government bonds have a special sort of\\nconscience. Even if the government issues bonds earmarked for\\nindustry, do you think they’ll be enthusiastic about buying them?\\nNo, of course they won’t. The main part of a bank’s business\\nis investment. Subscriptions to bonds are investments of one\\nkind. If they give us a loan, we offer them a security and pay\\nthem interest, don’t we? But they still won’t raise a finger to\\nhelp. So I say they’ve a queer sort of conscience... .”\\n\\n“ta, ha, ha, ha! .. .”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei’s laughter broke in upon Chu Yin-chiu’s\\ngrumbling. The short, fat fellow sprang up and placed himself\\nbetween Tang Yun-shan and Chu Yin-chiu with arms outspread\\nas if trying to separate two brawlers.\\n\\n“Now, now! Stop bickering,” he boomed. “No businessman\\nwill ever miss an opportunity to make money—the more, the\\nbetter. Mr. Chu has his difficulties and the bankers have\\ntheirs... .”\\n\\n“I agree with you there,” broke in Tang Yun-shan, seeing\\na chance to back up his argument. “The greater part of the\\nbankers’ capital is locked up in government bonds. Whenever\\nthe bonds fall, the bankers get a nasty jolt, find themselves in\\nurgent need of cash. ... For instance, Mr. Chu’s creditors\\nare now calling their loans. That’s why I say all the trouble’s\\ncaused by the unstable political situation.”\\n\\n“Mr. Sun Chi-jen’s just suggested something,” continued Chou\\nChung-wei. “It’s a wonderful idea, a very sound idea, indeed.\\nAnd he isn’t joking, either.”\\n\\nAs he said this, his face became red with excitement and ‘his\\nvoice rose and made everyone look round. Tang Yun-shan and\\nChu Yin-chiu turned to Sun Chi-jen expectantly.\\n\\n“Come on, Mr. Sun,” urged Chen Chun-yi, “tell us all about\\nit. What do you propose?”\\n\\nSun Chi-jen did not reply immediately, but just smiled and\\ndrew slowly at his cigar. Wang Ho-fu, who knew what it was\\nall about, could hardly wait any longer. Glancing at Sun Chi-\\njen for approval, he cleared his throat and outlined the latter’s\\n“excellent idea”:\\n\\n“Mr, Sun and I have talked it over several times already.\\nIt’s quite simple, really. It’s like this. We industrialists wiil\\nclub together to set up a bank of our own in order to finance our\\nown enterprises. At the moment cash is pouring into Shanghai\\nfrom further inland; it’s easy enough to sell shares, and we\\nshould have no trouble getting deposits. With a million dollars\\ncapital and a million or two in deposits, we could easily make\\na go of it. If we get permission to issue banknotes later on, so\\nmuch the better. . .. Well, that’s the gist of it. We\\'ve only\\ntalked about it so far: we haven’t actually done anything about\\nputting the idea into operation yet. Now that Mr. Chou’s let\\nthe cat out of the bag, I suppose we’d better talk it over.”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu, though he had a naturally loud voice, purposely\\nkept it down. What with this and the terrible din from the next\\nroom, everybody had to strain their ears to hear what he was\\nsaying. Actually, the idea was “quite simple.” It was not that\\nthe idea itself was new: some industrialists had done it before.\\nWhat was new was that Sun Chi-jen was advocating the\\ncollaboration of men of different trades, not just of one trade\\n\\n—these men, his listeners, for instance, represented widely diver-\\ngent interests conditioned by their different trades. As they\\nlistened in silence to Wang Ho-fu’s unhurried exposition, their\\nkeen minds quickly grasped this fact and each immediately\\nbegan to conjure up visions of his own personal schemes being\\nrealized by such an arrangement. After Wang Ho-fu had\\nfinished, they all sat brooding over his suggestions in silence for\\na while.\\n\\nThen Tang Yun-shan, who was not an industrialist, spoke up:\\n\\n“Mr. Sun’s plan can’t go wrong so long as it is endorsed by\\npowerful men and organized on a large scale, I suggest we ap-\\nproach Wu Sun-fu about it. I don’t think we can do it with-\\nout him. Don’t you think that’s about the size of it, gentlemen?”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it! That’s just what Mr. Sun and I have said\\nall along,” said Wang Ho-fu in his usual loud voice.\\n\\nThey continued their discussion and gradually got round to\\nconcrete plans. Chen Chun-yi and Chou Chung-wei, who were\\nnot very strong financially themselves, hoped that Sun Chi-jen,\\nas a shipping manager, and Wang Ho-fu, as a mine owner, had\\nplenty of capital which they could easily divert to the proposed\\nenterprise. On the other hand, Sun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu\\nthought that the other two, being ex-compradores, must have a\\ndecent sum available. But they all pinned their hopes on Wu\\nSun-fu, who had long been known for his capital, resourcefulness\\nand drive. Chu Yin-chiu, though he talked enthusiastically, had\\nhis doubts whether Wu Sun-fu would be willing to come in on\\nit. He knew that Wu Sun-fu was free from pressure from the\\nbankers and that he was comfortably off when everyone else\\nin the silk industry was feeling the pinch. Four or five months\\nago, before prices had plunged, hadn’t he managed to clear a\\nthousand bales in the export market? This had enabled him to\\nspeed up production to meet delivery, while everyone else in\\nthe industry was thinking of closing down for the time being.\\nBut even this happy man had one sorrow: he was short of dry\\ncocoons. As for new cocoons, it had been a bad season and\\nquotations were high. Of course, he could use Japanese dry\\ncocoons, but the Japanese foreign exchange was going up, even\\nthough Japanese cocoons were free from import duty, so that,\\n\\non balance, Japanese cocoons were just as dear... . Absorbed in\\nsuch calculations as these, Chu Yin-chiu sat pensive and silent.\\n\\nSuddenly a new idea struck him. He looked at Tang Yun-\\nshan and caught his eye.\\n\\n“Mr, Tang,” he said, “to set up a bank would be our salvation,\\nno doubt; but the government shouldn’t just stand by and watch\\nindustry go downhill when it is on industry that national pros-\\nperity and the people’s livelihood depend. You’ve just said that\\nthe government should use all money from bonds for the devel-\\nopment of industry... . Of course, this wouldn’t be practicable\\nat the moment, but the government could at least issue special\\nbonds to save a particular branch of industry which happens to\\nbe in distress. What do you think?”\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu said this for reasons of his own. He was of\\ncourse quite clear about it in his own mind, as he had just spent\\nquite a while working it all out. But Tang Yun-shan did not\\nseem to catch on, and before he could answer, the door of the\\nfuneral hall opened and in came Dr. Ting. Rubbing his hands\\nas usual, the doctor said with a sigh of relief:\\n\\n“Jt’s finished now. The International Undertakers have done\\na good job. Now that they’ve done the colouring, Old Mr. Wu\\nlies in his coffin as if he were asleep. His face looks flushed... .\\nWhy, it’s half past three already!”\\n\\nJust then two servants came in with platefuls of refresh-\\nments: lemonade, ice-cream, iced almond-jelly, fruit consommé,\\ncream layer-cakes, and all sorts of foreign-style delicacies. The\\ntable was laden with eatables, and all conversation was sus-\\npended while the guests attacked them.\\n\\nDr. Ting ran his eyes over the table but shook his head and\\nrefused to touch anything. He was quite well-known as a\\nstickler for wholesome food. Tang Yun-shan was about to tease\\nhim, when the other door of the dining-room opened and a maid\\nlooked in and said, “Could you spare a moment, Doctor?” Mrs.\\nWu Sun-fu was not feeling well. As Dr. Ting hurried off, Wu\\nSun-fu came in from the drawing-room to thank the mourners\\nfor coming. Seeing him come in, Tang Yun-shan quickly put\\ndown his half-eaten cake and cried excitedly, “Ah, you’ve\\ncome just right, Sun-fu! We want your opinion about an im-\\n\\nportant scheme. It was suggested by Mr. Sun Chi-jen and Mr.\\nWang Ho-fu here.”\\n\\nThe two men smiled modestly and outlined their plan. Jerking\\nhis thumb towards Tang Yun-shan, Wang Ho-fu laughed and\\nadded, “We have only been toying with the idea. We hardly\\nexpected that Mr. Tang would bother you with it. You’ve had\\na tiring day, but if you’re interested, we can talk about it some\\nother time.”\\n\\n“Now’s the time!” protested Tang Yun-shan. “Sun-fu is never\\ntired when he is keen on something.”\\n\\nIt seemed that he was more enthusiastic about it than anyone\\nelse. As he ushered people into the other section of the dining-\\nroom he rubbed in once more his theory on industrialists’ unity\\nas a condition of political stability. He maintained that if the\\nindustrialists had their own bank, that constituted an important\\nstep towards their unity.\\n\\nWithholding his opinion for the moment, Wu Sun-fu listened\\nto Tang Yun-shan holding forth. He knew only too well about\\nthe financial standing and abilities of these industrialists before\\nhim. There was not much they could do on their own. As\\nfor himself, he was not one to underestimate himself. If he\\nwent in with them, things would take on a new look, for he had\\nthe knack of making ordinary men into men of ability. Only\\nhe was not sure at the moment whether these men would unani-\\nmously proclaim him their leader. As he pondered, he ran his\\nkeen gaze over them to observe the expression on their faces.\\nSeeing that only Chu Yin-chiu was comparatively indifferent and\\nreserved, he took advantage of a lull in the general conversation\\nto ask him:\\n\\n“What do you think of the plan, Mr. Chu? At the present\\nmoment, we silk manufacturers are having difficulties all round.\\nIt has always been my hope that one day just such a bank should\\nbe organized to help keep industry on a more even keel.”\\n\\n“Mr. Wu, you’re being too modest in asking for my opinion.\\nWe\\'re all old friends here and know all about each other. At the\\nmoment only you have the necessary resources to get things\\ngoing, so we naturally look to you to help us out.”\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu sounded sincere enough, and Chen Chun-yi and\\nChou Chung-wei were the first to clap their hands in approval.\\n\\nBut Wu Sun-fu frowned as it dawned upon him that these three\\nmen’s idea was not to subscribe for shares in the projected bank,\\nbut to get someone else to finance it and supply them with\\ngenerous loans. Wu Sun-fu was about to reply, when Sun Chi-\\njen interjected:\\n\\n“Let’s be quite frank about it. My idea is essentially to set\\nup a bank to finance a few specific industries. The usual run\\nof bankers absorbs deposits and speculates in land, gold and gov-\\nernment bonds. The most they do for industrialists is to make\\nthem occasional loans on securities. But if we set up this bank,\\nwe\\'ll go all out to support a few of the more hopeful industries,\\nsuch as the long-distance coach services in North Kiangsu and\\nthe mines in Honan. As for helping out those industries which\\nare stranded at the moment, that’ll only be one of our minor func-\\ntions.... I am all for the scheme myself; the only trouble is\\nthat I haven’t the resources.”\\n\\nChen Chun-yi and Chou Chung-wei looked at each other in\\nconsternation: they never thought Sun Chi-jen would keep a\\nscheme like this up his sleeve all this time before mentioning\\nit. Since they did not feel that any good could ever come of\\nit for them, their enthusiasm began to cool off. Chu Yin-chiu\\nsmiled grimly, knowing only too well that Sun Chi-jen’s pro-\\nposal for a bank to finance buses and mines was just “a lot of\\neyewash.” Chu Yin-chiu was very good at guessing other peo-\\nple’s thoughts by his own.\\n\\nHowever, Wu Sun-fu’s eyes gleamed with excitement, for Sun\\nChi-jen was a comparatively new acquaintance, and Wu Sun-fu\\nhad hardly expected that this man with his small head and long\\nneck would turn out to be so far-sighted and unconventional.\\nHe felt that he had at last found a fine man after his own heart.\\nWu Sun-fu himself was ambitious, adventurous and plucky, and\\nhe naturally preferred to work with men of his own calibre. He\\nhated to see good industries go to rack and ruin in the hands of\\ninexperienced, inefficient, timorous or mediocre men, and when-\\never he came across such bunglers, he wanted to cut them down\\nwithout mercy and take their enterprises into his own iron hand.\\n\\nHis keen gaze searching Sun Chi-jen’s face, Wu Sun-fu nodded\\nthoughtfully. Now he wanted to see whether Wang Ho-fu was\\n\\nequally go-ahead. He turned to Wang Ho-fu on his left and asked\\ndeliberately, “What’s your opinion, Mr. Wang?”\\n\\n“On the whole I agree with Mr. Sun; but whatever we aim at\\neventually, we should keep our plans fairly flexible at first. With\\nthings as they are at the moment, I don’t think we can expect\\npeople to subscribe for shares in a bank set up for the express\\npurpose of financing new enterprises. I think we should run\\nit as an ordinary bank in the beginning.”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu spoke with his usual bantering smile, which con-\\ntrasted strongly with Sun Chi-jen’s reticence and taciturnity.\\nNortherner as he was, Wang Ho-fu combined a humorous dis-\\nposition with a great tenacity of purpose.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled and struck the arm of his chair with two\\nfingers.\\n\\n“Done!” he said resolutely. “When you two gentlemen lead\\nthe way, I’ll follow.”\\n\\n“You’re joking, Mr. Wu. It’s for us two to follow your lead.”\\n\\n“Ah! You three make a good trio!” interrupted Tang Yun-\\nshan, slapping his thigh and laughing noisily, “you see eye to\\neye and you’re evenly matched in strength and skill. Here’s an\\neternal triangle which will succeed!”\\n\\nHe quickly suppressed his mirth and suggested seriously, “As\\nfar as I can see, you three should start organizing a consortium.\\n\\nAs he said this, he turned to Chu Yin-chiu and the other two\\nin case they should feel out of it. “Do you agree with me, gentle-\\nmen? And all those who are here now will be the promoters.”\\n\\nThese three men, who had been listening in silence, had ex-\\npected that Wu Sun-fu would reject Sun Chi-jen’s wild scheme.\\nNow things had turned out just to the contrary. On top of that\\nTang Yun-shan was pressing them to come in. For the moment\\nthey did not know what to say, for, apart from the fact that\\nthey had no capital to spare at the moment, even if they could\\nobtain some, they would prefer to wait and see before plunging\\ninto such an ambitious scheme.\\n\\nThe conversation had taken a slightly embarrassing turn, but\\nthey were saved by the arrival of the butler Kao Sheng.\\n\\n“Mr. Tu would like to see you, sir,” he said to Wu Sun-fu.\\n“He\\'s waiting in the small drawing-room.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu, apparently guessing what it was about, excused\\nhimself and went out, but Chu Yin-chiu caught up with him in\\nthe doorway and blurted out:\\n\\n“you know I’ve a security loan from Mr. Tu Chu-chai, which\\nis due very soon. I wonder if you’d be good enough to put in\\na word for me?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu avoided his eye but, before he could answer, Chu\\nYin-chiu went on, “Just three months’ grace. That will do.”\\n\\n“But you know I spoke to him about it only the day before\\nyesterday. We\\'re all good friends and ought to help each other\\nout when we can. But so far as I can see, he’s in a tight spot\\nhimself at the moment. Money is tight, and he’s afraid that\\nthings may turn for the worse, so he’s calling all loans as they\\nfall due. You aren’t the only one involved... .”\\n\\n“In that case there’s only one way open to me: I\\'ll have to\\ngo bankrupt!”\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu said this in such an earnest tone that Wu Sun-\\nfu almost believed him. But a sharp glance at his face told\\nWu Sun-fu that this was only Chu Yin-chiu’s diplomacy. Rather\\nthan call his bluff, he said coldly, “It would hardly come to\\nthat. Your assets exceed your liabilities, so how can you talk\\nabout going bankrupt?”\\n\\n“Then the only alternative is that I close down for three\\nmonths.”\\n\\nAt this Wu Sun-fu could scarcely conceal his annoyance, for\\nhe knew very well that just now every silk factory was like\\na powder-magazine: it needed only a single spark to set the place\\nablaze and lead to a general strike throughout the industry. The\\nlast thing he wanted was a strike on his hands just when he\\nwas speeding up production to meet a contract. Chu Yin-chiu,\\nof course, was aware of all this, and his talk of “closing down\\nfor three months” was nothing but a threat. After a moment\\'s\\nhesitation, Wu Sun-fu adopted a different tone.\\n\\n“T\\'ll do my best for you, anyway. I\\'ll let you know the result\\nlater on.”\\n\\nThen, before Chu Yin-chiu could involve him any deeper, Wu\\nSun-fu made good his escape, a malicious smile on his lips.\\n\\nca\\n\\nTu Chu-chai was waiting impatiently in the drawing-room. He\\n\\nhad been taking a large quantity of snuff and sneezed twice.\\nHe wandered absent-mindedly over to the door and glanced out\\njust in time to see Wu Sun-fu escape from Chu Yin-chiu. The\\nmixture of anger and misery in his face surprised Tu Chu-chai,\\nwho supposed that there had been trouble in Wu Sun-fun’s fac-\\ntory or that another telegram had come from the country.\\n\\n“What\\'s the matter?” he inquired hurriedly, stepping forward.\\n“More trouble?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled bitterly but did not reply. He closed the\\ndoor and threw himself down wearily on to a sofa.\\n\\n“Life’s just one long battle,” he said. “We’re walking over a\\nmine field. At any moment you may be blown to pieces!”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai paled at what seemed to be a confirmation of his\\nfears. But Wu Sun-fu’s manner suddenly changed and he smiled\\nbitterly.\\n\\n“So that so-and-so Chu Yin-chiu thinks he can play tricks on\\nme, too, eh?” he said with assumed unconcern. “Hal”\\n\\n“Oh, Chu Yin-chiu, is it?”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai felt relieved and sneezed violently.\\n\\n“Yes, him. The one you saw just now. He wants you to\\nextend your loan for another three months... or rather, at\\nleast three months, by the tone of his voice. Apart from that,\\nhe thinks he can play a mean trick on me— says he’ll go bank-\\nrupt or close down his factory. He’s trying to intimidate me.\\nHe takes us for a pack of fools that he can monkey about with\\nas he likes.”\\n\\n“T see ... and what did you say to him?”\\n\\n“1 said I would see him later.... But, Chu-chai, are you\\ngoing to give him a further extension?”\\n\\n“If he absolutely refuses to settle up, there’s nothing I can do\\nabout it. It isn’t much, though— only eighty thousand dollars,\\nand I hold his pledge: a hundred and fifty bales of medium-\\ngrade dry silk... .”\\n\\nBefore he could finish, Wu Sun-fu jumped up and paced up\\nand down like a hungry caged lion, then sat down again and\\nsettled himself lower into the sofa.\\n\\n“Why bother with him?” he asked sardonically, shaking his\\nhead. “You aren’t a charitable institution, and you shouldn’t\\nlet him take advantage of you.— You don’t really believe he’s\\n\\nshort of money, do you? Well, he’s not. He’s just mean, mean\\nand stupid, and if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s a man\\nwho’s mean and stupid at the same time. I remember some time\\nago he refused to sell his B-grade silk when the price was nine\\nhundred taels and good enough to cover the cost. Pure mean-\\nness! Later on, the price dropped to eight hundred and fifty\\ntaels. He imagined it would go up again, and, instead of selling,\\nbought in fifty bales of Szechuan silk. That will show you how\\nstupid he is, though he wouldn’t have done such a stupid thing\\nif he hadn’t been so mean. He’s just not fit to be in business!\\nAnd he can’t manage his factory properly, either. The silk from\\nhis factory is very poor—full of hairs. He is ruining the rep-\\nutation of the whole silk industry. It’s a crying shame that\\na man like that should have all those first-class new Italian\\nmachines! .. .”\\n\\n“What are we to do, then?” interrupted Tu Chu-chai, who was\\ntotally ignorant of factory management and was getting impa-\\ntient.\\n\\n“What are we to do? Let him have another seventy thousand\\nto make it up to a hundred and fifty thousand.”\\n\\n“What? Another seventy thousand?”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai was so startled that he spilt a pinch of snuff all\\nover his lap.\\n\\n“Yes, 1 said seventy thousand dollars,” said Wu Sun-fu, smil-\\ning. “But I don’t mean you should extend the old loan of eighty\\nthousand and give him a new loan of seventy thousand on\\ntop of that. He must still pay off the old loan when it falls due.\\nWhat we shall do is to give him a new security loan of a hun-\\ndred and fifty thousand dollars and deduct the old loan of eighty\\nthousand plus an interest... .”\\n\\n“I really don’t understand why we have to go about it in such\\na round-about way. All Chu Yin-chiu wants is that the old loan\\nshould be extended, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Look here, old man! It’s like this. The new loan of a hun-\\ndred and fifty thousand dollars would be for one month only.\\nAs for the pledge, we won’t accept any kind of silk, finished,\\nraw, or mixed. We\\'ll accept only dry cocoons. And the agree-\\nment will be that in case of default the creditor shall have the\\nright to: foreclose.... And, besides, you will act only as a\\n\\nmiddleman and nothing more. We\\'ll say that the new loan’s\\nto be negotiated with a certain consortium and that you\\'ll be\\nglad to recommend him.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu stopped and fixed his sharp eyes unwaveringly on\\nTu Chu-chai’s goat-like face. He knew that this elder brother-\\nin-law of his was at once suspicious and avaricious and that he\\ncould never be straightforward and commit himself to anything.\\nWu Sun-fu was now quietly waiting for Tu Chu-chai to work\\nthings out. Meanwhile, he fell to imagining Chu Yin-chiu’s\\ncocoons tumbling into his lap in a month’s time. And perhaps\\nin due course of time —say, three or four months’ time — even\\nthose new Italian machines might come under his own efficient\\nand careful management.\\n\\nJust then the door of the small drawing-room opened and in\\ncame Mrs. Wu Sun-fu, looking rather out of sorts. She sat down\\nquietly in a chair opposite Wu Sun-fu and looked at him as if\\nshe had something to say. He remembered that a short while\\nbefore she had complained of a pain in the chest and had sent\\nfor the doctor. Just as he was going to ask her how she was,\\nTu Chu-chai stood up, sneezed and said:\\n\\n“All right, Vll do as you say.... But, Sun-fu, are you sure\\nhis cocoons will make a good enough pledge? What if they\\ndon’t come to the hundred and fifty thousand dollars?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu burst out laughing.\\n\\n“Chu-chai,” he said, “are you really afraid the pledge’s not\\nworth that much? I’m only afraid Chu Yin-chiu won’t want\\nto part with his cocoons. I expect they will cease to be his in\\na month’s time, unless he acquires the touch of Midas by then,\\nand then we\\'ll see once more what a fool the man is. Anyway,\\nwhy is he hoarding nearly two hundred thousand dollars’ worth\\nof cocoons in that little factory of his? He bought up so many\\nlast year that the prices soared and the rest of us were the\\nlosers. It’s high time someone relieved him of his cocoons.”\\n\\n“Oh, what a snake you are!” exclaimed his wife, her haggard\\nface lighting up with a dazzling smile.\\n\\nThe two men looked at each other and burst out laughing.\\n\\n“That’s settled, then. ... There was something else I wanted\\nto see you about —oh, yes: Chao Po-tao rang me up to tell me\\nhe’d taken the first step. About the second step, there’s ap-\\n\\nparently been an unexpected change in the market, so we’ll have\\nto work out a different approach. He’s waiting for us in the\\nCathay Hotel... .”\\n\\n“Then let’s go,” said Wu Sun-fu briskly. “We can discuss the\\nconsortium idea in the car.”\\n\\nThe two of them went out of the drawing-room and after a\\nmoment the car could be heard starting up outside of the window.\\n\\nLeft alone, Mrs. Wu Sun-fu gave herself up to day-dreaming\\nand let her thoughts wander. The sound of the car took her\\nback seven or eight years to when she was still Miss Lin Pei-yao,\\na student at the missionary school, to the time when, for the\\nfirst time in her young life, she had gone for an outing in a car\\nwith some of her school friends — girls in their teens who never\\ndreamed that the wine of youth would one day be. drained dry.\\nTheir heads were full of visions of valiant knights and handsome\\nprinces from Ivanhoe and The Tempest and of the realm of poesy\\nwith its islands, its ancient castles, its great forests and its\\nmoonlit balconies. Their school, hidden away as it was on the\\nedge of a spacious park outside the city, seemed to them just\\nsuch an enchanted land, and there they used to dream their rosy\\ndreams of the future. She herself, Miss Lin Pei-yao, endowed\\nwith her scholarly father’s idealistic temperament, was especially\\nfond of building castles in the air, and on many a balmy, moonlit\\nnight she would lie awake with starry eyes, enjoying the beauti-\\nful dreams her imagination conjured up.\\n\\nBut these “midsummer night’s dreams” of hers were destined,\\nas such dreams always are, to be short-lived. Her father died\\nafter a short illness, and her mother did not long survive him.\\nThe realities of life were beginning to invade her virgin heart.\\nThen, just when her whole world had crumbled about her ears,\\nanother kind of “tempest,” as heroic and tragic as the other,\\nclaimed her attention: the stirring movement against the Thir-\\ntieth of May Massacre.* There suddenly came into her life a\\n\\n*On May 30, 1925, the students and workers of Shanghai held a\\ndemonstration in the International Settlement to protest against the\\nkilling of a Chinese worker Ku Cheng-hung by the management of\\na Japanese cotton mill in Shanghai for his part in organizing a strike.\\nThe British police in the Settlement opened fire on the demonstrators,\\ninflicting heavy casualties. This atrocity gave rise to a country-wide\\nanti-imperialist movement.\\n\\nyoung man who to her eyes seemed like a knight from the Age\\nof Chivalry. She was frightened and delighted. Then this\\nyoung man, who had flashed through her life like a comet, sud-\\ndenly disappeared and left her heart-broken.\\n\\nAnd after that she had—\\n\\nAt this point in her reverie she shivered and came to with a\\nstart. She jerked up her head as if startled and looked all\\nround. The entire room was as luxuriously and fashionably\\nfurnished as any woman could wish: large oil paintings on the\\nwalls, curios on the sideboard, vases of flowers, expensive fur-\\nniture and, in addition to all this, a parrot in a cage. Never-\\ntheless, Mrs. Wu Sun-fu felt something was missing. Ever since\\nshe had become mistress of this house, this feeling that there\\nwas “something missing” had been preying on her mind on and\\noff.\\n\\nIn her student days she had filled her mind with idealistic\\nimages from the English classics which she had never since been\\nable to forget. During these past few years she had come to\\nknow something of the realities of life, but they had not yet\\nmade her realize that her husky, strong-willed husband, with\\nhis purplish, pimply face, was one of the knights or princes of\\nthe twentieth-century industrial world. These industrial knights\\nand princes might not be able to fence and ride like the knights\\nand princes of the olden days, but they could do wonderful cal-\\nculations on the abacus and drive motorcars. But Mrs. Wu Sun-\\nfu could not appreciate this, nor could she come to realize that\\nshe herself was far from being a mediaeval “lady fayre.”\\n\\n“Visitor!” croaked the parrot, startling Mrs. Wu Sun-fu out of\\nher day-dream. Standing in the doorway was an upstanding\\nyoung man in uniform, a suspicion of a smile on his handsome,\\ndignified face and a twinkle in his eye ~ Col. Lei!\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu looked up with a start: for a split second\\ndream and reality had merged into one in her mind. She could\\nhardly believe her eyes. Col. Lei bowed and came over to her,\\nthe sound of his measured tread finally bringing her back to\\nearth. At the same time, her innate sense of duty and polite-\\nness immediately took possession of her again and she put on\\na smile and rose to greet him.\\n\\n“Why, it’s Col. Leif! Do take a seat.... You wanted to see\\nSun-fu? He’s just gone out.”\\n\\n“Yes, I saw him go, madame,” he replied in a soft, courteous\\nvoice. “He asked me to stay to dinner.”\\n\\nInstead of sitting down, he remained standing about a yard\\naway from her, his bright eyes searching her rather bewildered\\nface.\\n\\nShe instinctively smiled and stepped backwards to sit down\\nagain on the sofa.\\n\\nFot a moment neither of them spoke, and there was an\\nawkward silence.\\n\\nCol, Lei dropped his eyes from Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face to stare\\nat the floor, trembling slightly. Suddenly he thrust his right\\nhand into his pocket, stepped forward, his head still bowed,\\nand blurted out:\\n\\n“Madame Wu, I’m leaving for the front tomorrow morning.\\nThere’s hardly any chance of my coming out of it alive. So\\nthis is the last time I shall see you, the last time I shall be able\\nto speak to you. Madame Wu, I have something here I\\'d like\\nto give you.”\\n\\nHe lifted his head again and drew his hand out of his pocket.\\nIt was a book. He flicked it open in the middle and offered\\nit to her with both hands.\\n\\nIt was a tattered old copy of The Sorrows of Young Werther\\nin Chinese, and between the pages was a faded white rose.\\n\\nMemories of the stormy “Thirtieth of May Movement” launched\\nby the students of Shanghai came flooding back when she saw\\nthis tattered book and its faded rose, making her tremble from\\nhead to foot. She snatched the book from his hands and stared\\nat him, speechless with emotion.\\n\\nCol. Lei forced a smile and seemed to sigh. “Madame Wu,”\\nhe went on, “you may regard the book and the rose as.a gift from\\nme, or, if you like, as something you are looking after for me.\\nYou see, my parents are dead and I have no brothers or sisters,\\nand practically no close friends. There is only one thing I’ve\\ntreasured all my life: this book with its faded rose. Before I\\ngo to the front I want to give these treasures to the person I\\n\\n”\\n\\ntrust most. ...\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu let out a sudden cry and her face flushed.\\n\\nCol. Lei paused a second, then went on urgently and insistently:\\n\\n“Madame Wu, I’ve chosen you to look after them, and I hope\\nyou won\\'t refuse them. I can never for one moment forget\\nhow I came by the book and the rose. One evening five years\\nago, an evening just like this, a close, muggy evening, I received\\nthis flower from the hand of a most dignified, noble, and lovely\\nlady — my reward for my adoration of her. This book The Sor-\\nrows of Young Werther has witnessed our — Madame Wu, I hope\\nyou won’t mind if I say—our love? But, poor student that I\\nwas, I dared not hope... circumstances would not permit it.\\nMadame Wu, you must have seen that. And then... you must\\nsee now why I suddenly ran away from the angel I worshipped.\\nI went to Canton and entered the Whampoa Military Academy.\\nLater, I followed the colours from Kwangtung to Peking and\\nrose from company commander to regimental commander. I\\ncrawled in and out of piles of corpses, was nearly killed several\\ntimes and I lost everything except this book and this rose, which\\nI never parted with for one moment. But after I’d escaped\\nfrom the jaws of death, what did I find when I got back! I\\nsearched Shanghai for six months and more before I found my\\nluck was out. Now my hopes are dead and my courage is gone.\\nMadame Wu, I’m going to battle again— this time to die. But\\nI can’t let this book and this rose be shattered to pieces on the\\nbattlefield. Now I’ve found the right person to look after this\\ntattered book and this faded rose for me... .”\\n\\nCol. Lei’s voice shook, and beads of perspiration broke out on\\nhis forehead. He took a deep breath and sank on to a nearby\\nchair. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face had turned pale from red and she\\ngazed at him dumbfounded.\\n\\nCol. Lei smiled bitterly and suddenly straightened up as if\\ntorn by some inner conflict. He stood up abruptly and went up\\nto her again.\\n\\n“Madame Wu,” he said slowly and hoarsely, “I’m glad I’ve had\\nthe opportunity of telling you all this. Now I can die content.”\\n\\nHe raised his hand in a salute and turned to go.\\n\\n“Lei Ming! Oh, Lei Ming!”\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu had sprung up and called after him in a\\nquavering voice.\\n\\nCol. Lei stopped in his tracks and wheeled round. But she\\nhad nothing to say to him. Her face crimsoned, her eyes swam\\nand her chest heaved violently. Suddenly she stretched out her\\narms; Col. Lei ran to her and she threw herself into his arms\\nand buried her face in his shoulder. Col. Lei bent his head and\\ntheir lips came together.\\n\\n“My dear!” squawked the parrot, startling them out of their\\nembrace. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu started as if woken from a dream and\\npushed Col. Lei away; then, clutching the book to her breast,\\nshe ran out and upstairs to her room, where she flung herself on\\nthe bed. Soon the white embroidered pillowcase was wet with\\nher hot tears.\\nTV\\n\\nON the afternoon of Old Mr. Wu’s funeral, in the tovn of\\nShuangchiao, about seventy miles from Shanghai, Tseng Tsang-\\nhai, Wu Sun-fu’s uncle on his mother’s side, was reclining on an\\nopium-couch in his large, gloomy house, having one of his\\nhabitual fits of temper.\\n\\nNow in his fifties, this senior member of the landed gentry\\nwas known in those parts as the “Local King.” Since at the age\\nof forty, he had had his first and only son, whom he doted on,\\nhis greed, avarice and meanness had become worse than ever.\\nUnfortunately, the boy was a good-for-nothing, with the result\\nthat his father, who should have been enjoying his retirement\\nby now, had to continue to manage the household affairs on his\\nown and even bother himself with such trivialities as getting in\\nprovisions.\\n\\nBesides, for the last two or three years he had had a run of\\nbad luck. When for the first time the Kuomintang flag had\\nflown over the town of Shuangchiao, there had been a great deal\\nof noisy but serious shouting of such slogans as “Down with the\\ndespotic landlords and gentry!” Greatly alarmed, Tseng Tsang-\\nhai had fled from the town and gone to stay in Shanghai for a\\nwhile. Later, the youngsters who had been responsible for the\\ndisturbance either escaped or were arrested, and Shuangchiao\\nreturned to normal again. But from then on Tseng Tsang-hai’s\\nrégime did not continue to go unchallenged, for another group\\nof youngsters far from shouting “Down with the landlords!” in-\\nstalled themselves in the town as “New Nobility” and began to\\nusurp many of the privileges which Tseng Tsang-hai had enjoyed\\nexclusively until then. He found it hard to believe that his own\\nstatus had been so undermined and reduced. The “New Nobility”\\nnot only had as much say in the running of the town as he did,\\n\\nbut even seemed quite anxious to oust him completely. Whenever\\nhe was thwarted by them he would grumble, “When you’re old\\nyou’re treated as a back number.” His only consolation was a\\nrather forlorn hope about his son’s future.\\n\\nThis afternoon, Tseng Tsang-hai was fuming on his. opium-\\ncouch, not because he was being hounded by the “New Nobility”\\nagain, but because the telegram from Wu Sun-fu announcing the\\ndeath of his father had arrived much too late. When the tele-\\ngram was put into his hand, he had been overjoyed to see that\\nit was from his nephew, a famous man in Shanghai who was\\nalways getting his name in the papers, He had thought the\\ntelegram must be some urgent message from his nephew seeking\\nhis advice. The fact that even his important nephew looked to\\nhim for advice put him in a different category altogether from\\nthe “New Nobility” who only yesterday had been a pack of sniv-\\nelling young puppies. But when the telegram turned out to be\\nan obituary notice, his spirits sank. He was furious. What an-\\nnoyed him was that this was nothing more than a commonplace\\nnotice of death, instead of some important matter requiring his\\nadvice—it was not the sort of thing he could carry around in\\nhis pocket to show to people and brag about. And then the\\ntelegram had been delivered appallingly late. On top of that,\\nhis nephew had failed to show him the courtesy due to an uncle:\\nhe had sent only an ordinary telegram—and even that only as\\na matter of form—instead of a specially chartered boat to fetch\\nhim to Shanghai. In his bygone days of power and prestige he\\nwould, under similar circumstances, have given the telegraph\\noffice hell for the delay, but, as it was, he was now an old man\\nwho did not count for much and there was nothing he could do\\nexcept fume and rage in silence.\\n\\nSuddenly he scrambled off his opium-couch and paced up and\\ndown. He took the telegram to the window where the light was\\nbetter and perused it carefully once more. His anger flared up\\nagain and he felt an overwhelming urge to go and storm at the\\n“muddlers” at the telegraph office, when his labourer Ah Erh\\ncame in perspiring and spattered with mud. Finding his master\\nin an ugly mood, Ah Erh just stood back panting noisily.\\n\\n“Ah, you\\'re back, eh? I was thinking that Chilichiao Village\\nhad been shifted during the night so that you couldn’t find it!\\n\\nI was just going to report you missing to the police. ... You\\'d\\nbetter watch your step! If you carry on the way you\\'re going,\\nyou\\'ll find yourself in prison one of these days!”\\n\\nAs Tseng Tsang-hai pronounced this threat, he tilted his head\\non one side and glared at Ah Erh. He always launched into a\\ntirade like this whenever Ah Erh came home: late from an\\nerrand, though he would never have done anything about it.\\nBut, this time, Ah Erh had the bad luck to walk in just when\\nhis master was boiling with rage. Then Tseng Tsang-hai really\\nlost his temper at the sight of Ah Erh standing there just pant-\\ning and mopping his face instead of reporting the result of his\\nerrand at once as he usually did.\\n\\n“You scoundrel, you!’ shouted Tseng Tsang-hai hoarsely,\\nstamping his foot. “Speak up, can’t you? How much did you\\ncollect?”\\n\\n“Not a penny. — They’re having a meeting in the village today\\nand they were banging gongs everywhere to let people know\\nabout it—”\\n\\nAh Erh stopped short and lifted the hem of his blue jacket\\nto wipe his face once more. As he closed his eyes he could see\\nseveral thousand villagers at a meeting with countless red ban-\\nners fluttering on their hoes, and several thousand terrible eyes\\nblazing. His ears instantly rang once more with crashing of\\ngongs and the angry roar of the crowd. He felt his heart pound-\\ning as if it would burst and he went hot and cold all over.\\n\\nTseng T\\'sang-hai had no idea what was going on in Ah Erh’s\\nmind and Ah Erh’s unusual reticence made him see red.\\n\\n“To hell with their bloody meeting! Your business was to\\ncollect debts for me. Didn’t you tell them: ‘If you don’t settle\\nup today, Mr. Tseng’ll send the police round tomorrow and put\\nyou under arrest’? Didn’t you tell the bastards that?7—Meeting\\nbe damned!”\\n\\n“All right, then: you carry on and send the police! But you\\nwon\\'t see me going there again—not even if you cut off my head.\\nAll the villagers have joined some association. ... The moment\\nthey see me they know what I am there for. They swear at\\nme and try to keep me there and want me to... .”\\n\\nThere was a note of suppressed defiance in Ah Erh’s voice\\nand he did not even say “sir.” This was no small offence, but\\n\\nfortunately Tseng Tsang-hai was too busy worrying about his\\nuncollected debts to notice it. He cut Ah Erh short with a thump\\non the table.\\n\\n“Blast their association!” he roared. “Chen Lao-pa—I know\\nhe’s a committee member of that confounded peasants’ associa-\\ntion. He’s a money-lender himself, and he allows them to get\\naway with their debts to me! I’ll call him to account! I’ve never\\nheard of such nonsense! Perhaps you’re lying to me, you\\nscoundrel—I don’t suppose you went near the place! Mark my\\nwords: I\\'ll find out if you didn’t, and you won’t get away with\\nit...”\\n\\n“It isn’t Chen Lao-pa’s association. It’s a new one. Nobody\\nknows about it except the people in the village. People here in\\nthe town haven’t heard about it yet. They had their first meet-\\ning this morning—they were beating gongs to call the people up.\\nThere were thousands there—all barefoot and wearing short\\njackets; there wasn’t a single gown among them. They’re all\\ngenuine poor villagers. .. .”\\n\\nAh Erh had begun his tale gleefully, unabashed by Tseng\\nTsang-hai’s threats; but he broke off suddenly when he saw that\\nhis master had gone deathly pale, and that his hands were trem-\\nbling as he collapsed on to the opium-couch and closed his eyes.\\nDuring the ten years that Ah Erh had worked for him, Tseng\\nTsang-hai had always seemed a formidable figure, so it came as a\\nrevelation to see him shaken and unnerved like a defeated\\nfighting-cock.\\n\\nAh Erh suddenly wavered. A good-natured fellow at heart,\\nhe could not bear to see his master in such a bad way. If he\\nwere to cause this old opium-smoker to drop dead from fright\\nit would be a terrible crime! The gods would surely punish him\\nby cutting short his life! However, he need not have worried,\\nfor Tseng Tsang-hai suddenly opened his bloodshot eyes and\\nglared fiercely, and his face became livid. He sprang up, seized\\nthe opium-pipe, sprang forward in a rage, and aimed a blow at\\nAh Erh’s head.\\n\\n“You scum, you!” he screamed. “You\\'re as bad as they are!\\nHow dare you lot start a rebellion!”\\n\\nCrack! ... the long ivory opium-pipe broke in two. It had\\nmissed the labourer’s head altogether, for Ah Ern nad warded It\\n\\noff with his brawny, sun-tanned arm, but this attack made his\\nblood boil and he stood his ground with glaring eyes. Still\\nbrandishing the broken half of the pipe and thundering away,\\nTseng Tsang-hai snatched up a pewter candlestick and hurled\\nit at Ah Erh’s face. This, too, went wide of the mark; but when\\nit hit the ground the sharp spike at the top pierced Ah Erh’s\\nshin and made it bleed. Ah Erh’s eyes blazed with anger. “Kill\\nthe bloody old fleecer!” the villagers at Chilichiao had shouted,\\nand this phrase now came back to him with particular vividness,\\nand made him clench his fists. If Tseng Tsang-hai tried to come\\none step nearer, he was more than ready to fight!\\n\\nSuddenly a pandemonium of cursing and screaming broke out\\nin another room and the next moment an attractive young\\nwoman burst in upon them, weeping and wailing, and threw\\nherself on Tseng Tsang-hai, so that the old man was nearly\\nthrown off balance.\\n\\n“What\\'s the matter, Ah-chin?” asked Tseng Tsang-hai de-\\njectedly, leaning on the table. Hard on the first woman’s heels\\ncame another, tall and sturdy, and immediately the room rang\\nwith their shouting and cursing. Shaking his head and sighing,\\nTseng Tsang-hai took refuge on his opium-couch, where he lay\\nwith closed eyes. Although he was known far and wide as an\\nold hand at manipulating lawsuits, he was utterly helpless when\\nit came to sorting out the quarrels between these two women—his\\ndaughter-in-law and his unofficial concubine. He had no alterna-\\ntive but to leave them to it and take no notice.\\n\\nAh Erh had slipped out of the room, leaving the two women\\nscreaming abuse at one another while a wet-nurse with Tseng\\nTsang-hai’s grandson in her arms and a scullery-maid stood\\nunder the eaves outside, listening and watching. Tseng Tsang-\\nhai was taking comfort in a sizzling opium-pipe, regretting the\\nbroken ivory pipe and wondering what this new association in\\nChilichiao Village was all about. He now felt rather sorry that\\nhe had let himself go like that in front of Ah Erh just now. His\\nscheming mind was soon busy on another train of thought: So\\nthe Communists are egging the villagers to join an association\\nand to hold meetings, are they? That means they must have\\nsomething big up their sleeve! But there’s nothing to be afraid\\nof, really: there’s the battalion of regulars in the town, besides\\n\\nthe local security corps. This would be a good opportunity to\\nget the Bureau of Public Safety to round up some of the Com-\\nmunists and deal with them—and how about calling my debtors\\nwho won\\'t pay up Communists. ... Then another thing: nobody\\nin the whole town has heard about what’s going on in Chilichiao\\nVillage! These “New Nobility” here who are always trying so\\nhard to squeeze me out are just asleep! At the thought of the\\nignorance of the “New Nobility” Tseng Tsang-hai’s haggard face\\nlit up with a smile of complacency. He knew now how he\\ncould recover all the debts owing him, principal and interest,\\nand also how he could expose the incompetence and weakness\\nof the “New Nobility.” If they had not even heard of the exist-\\nence of Communists in the village, what business had they to\\nbe where they were?\\n\\n“Very well, I\\'ll do it,” he suddenly said aloud. “I’ll teach the\\n‘New Nobility’ a lesson! Ha, ha!”\\n\\nWell pleased with himself, Tseng Tsang-hai cackled triumphant-\\nly and laid down the opium-pipe. His hoarse voice filled the\\nroom, and not until he heard it himself did he realize that the\\nwomen’s brawl had somehow stopped completely. He looked\\nround in surprise and discovered his concubine sitting at a table\\nopposite the opium-couch, her face buried in a handkerchief as\\nif she’ were crying.\\n\\n“ah-chin!” Tseng Tsang-hai called softly. No answer. He did\\nnot know what to do. He hoisted himself up on the couch and\\nwas intending to go across and say something to soothe her,\\nwhen she uncovered her face and glared disdainfully at him. She\\nhad not been weeping at all, though her eyes were red.\\n\\n“I’m going back home to the country tomorrow,” she shrilled\\n“I’m not going to stay here to be insulted and ill-treated. What\\ndo you take me for?”\\n\\nSuddenly she started crying—or rather sobbing, for she shed\\nno real tears.\\n\\n“Oh, what do you keep quarrelling with that woman for?\\nI’ve no time to deal with her. Just wait until Chia-chu comes\\nhome, and then I’! tell him to take his wife in hand. And I\\'ll\\ntell him to give her a good hiding, and then you’ll be even with\\nher. Come now, it’s nothing much, really. Don’t take that sort\\nof woman seriously.... Now, you go and see if my bird’s-\\n\\nnest porridge is ready. I want to have it straight away, because\\nI’m going out on urgent business.”\\n\\nWhile he was saying this, he walked over and wiped her face\\nwith his loose, opium-stained sleeve, as if to dry her tears, but\\nshe shook her head, looked askance at him and snorted:\\n\\n“Hm! Do you mean all that?”\\n\\n“Of course I mean it! When I say someone must be punished,\\nyou can be sure that they will be. I’m master here; I don’t have\\nto lift a finger—somebody else’ll do it for me. Remember when\\nyour husband came here to make trouble not long ago? I\\npromised to punish him for you, didn’t I? And didn’t I get the\\npolice to deal with him? This time, it’s a bit different, though:\\nyou can’t very well hand your own daughter-in-law over to the\\npolice. Ill have to get my son to deal with her. He’ll be home\\nany moment now, and then I\\'ll tell him to give the bitch a good\\nhiding. And what I say goes.”\\n\\n“Huh! So what you say goes, does it? What about that gold\\nring you promised me last month? You still haven’t—”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s a different matter, though: that costs money.\\n—Anyway, what’s the use of a gold ring? You can only wear it\\non your finger, but it won’t do you any good there. Wouldn’t it\\nbe much better if I put the money in the bank to earn some\\ninterest for you? Now, run along and see to my porridge, and\\nwhen I come home, I’ll give you a passbook for a hundred dol-\\nlars. Satisfied?”\\n\\nShe apparently was, for she went out looking rather pleased\\nwith herself. He chuckled, gratified by his diplomatic coup. He\\nreturned to his couch and began cheerfully roasting a large bead\\nof opium.\\n\\nHardly had he put the pellet into the bowl of the pipe and\\nbegun drawing at it, when pandemonium broke out again in\\nthe back of the house, this time with a man’s voice adding to the\\ndin: his son Chia-chu had come on the scene. Tseng Tsang-hai\\ngripped the pipe harder and sucked away at it as if nothing had\\nhappened, when a shrill accusation caught his ear above the\\nhubbub of cursing and shouting:\\n\\n“You shameless hussy! The old man can’t satisfy you, so you\\ngo and set your cap at the young one! You don’t imagine I’m\\ngoing to let you get away with that, do you?”\\n\\nThe voice was his daughter-in-law’s and was answered by a\\nlaugh from the concubine Ah-chin. Suddenly, the son’s voice\\nbroke in with an angry roar, while his wife sobbed and swore,\\nand soon the sounds of weeping, cursing and fighting had blurred\\ninto a chaos of noise.\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai stopped smoking. He must try to understand\\nwhat she had meant by: “The old man can’t satisfy you!” Al-\\nthough all this was not so important to him as his financial af-\\nfairs and he could afford to disregard it, nevertheless he felt\\nrather upset and ill at ease. What perturbed him more was the\\nidea that his son was quite willing to beat his wife not out of\\nfilial duty and obedience to his father, but for another reason\\naltogether! Tseng Tsang-hai became quite miserable at his loss\\nof authority over his son.\\n\\nSuddenly, heavy footsteps roused him from his reverie. His\\nson Chia-chu stood before him: an ugly, wild-looking youth of\\nnineteen. Throwing a book he was holding on to a chair with a\\nthud and sitting down on a square stool by the couch, he looked\\ntowards his father.\\n\\n“Chia-chu,” said Tseng Tsang-hai, before his son could open\\nhis mouth, “Old Mr. Wu has died. I had a telegram from your\\ncousin Sun-fu. You’re free at the moment, so you can go to\\nShanghai tomorrow to offer our condolences. — And you can get\\nyour cousin to find you a job while you’re about it.”\\n\\nHe spoke slowly as he put forward the idea he had just worked\\nout, while his heart contracted at those phrases “the old man...\\nthe young one... satisfy you!”\\n\\n“I don’t want to go to Shanghai. I’ve some urgent business\\non my hands. Give me fifty dollars.”\\n\\n“What! Money again?” exclaimed Tseng Tsang-hai, rolling\\nover and sitting up. “Ah, you don’t realize how difficult it is to\\nmake money. ‘Urgent business,’ eh? You’d better tell me ail\\nabout it first.”\\n\\nInstead of answering his father at once, Chia-chu fumbled in\\nhis pocket and pulled out a black card, which he thrust under\\nhis father’s nose.\\n\\n“What do I want money for? I’m throwing a party!” he swag-\\ngered. “Look at this: see what it is?”\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai’s sharp eye and alert mind told him at once\\nthat it was nothing less than a Kuomintang party card! He was\\nrapturous. He snatched it, rubbed his eyes, and examined it closely\\nin the light of the opium lamp: yes, it was a party card, right\\nenough. It had on it his son’s photograph and the inscription:\\n“Party Membership Card No. 23, so-and-so District... .””\"— “So\\nyou rank as high as twenty-third, eh?” the old man muttered\\ngleefully to himself. He picked up his spectacles from the opium-\\nplate, settled them on his nose, and carefully examined the party\\nseal stamped on the card. When he was satisfied, he went over\\nrespectfully to his son and urged him solemnly:\\n\\n“Look after it, son, and don’t lose it.”\\n\\nHe broke into a happy laugh and patted his-son on the\\nshoulder.\\n\\n“So you’re emerging from obscurity at last!” he went on. “T\\'ve\\nalways said you won\\'t find a puppy in a tiger’s den! —Give a\\nparty by all means. Have all your friends in this evening to\\ncelebrate. Will fifty dollars be enough? No, Ill give you a\\nhundred. And then tomorrow night I\\'ll invite my old friends in\\nas well. Oh, yes, I’ve got something else to tell you. Just a\\nminute, till I’ve finished this pipe.”\\n\\nThe old man felt triumphant. He lay down on the couch again\\nand began drawing hard at his pipe. His son was smirking with\\nsatisfaction, but as he couldn’t find anything more to brag about,\\nhe joined his father on the couch and carefully tucked his party\\ncard away in an inside pocket. Both of them treasured this\\ncard, but for quite different reasons. To Chia-chu it was as good\\nas a passbook with which he could always get plenty of money\\nto splash around out of the old fool.\\n\\nWhen Tseng Tsang-hai had finished his pipe, he picked up the\\nteapot, put the spout to his lips and gulped down several mouth-\\nfuls of tea.\\n\\n“Chia-chu,” he said in a low voice, “I’ve got some important\\ninformation for the police. I was planning to go and tell them\\nmyself, but now I think you ought to go instead. Now that you’re\\na brand-new party member, you ought to assert your authority\\nand try your hand at something important and distinguish your-\\nself! Yes, this is a rare opportunity for you. That’s two strokes\\nof luck we’ve had today!”\\n\\nChia-chu was rather taken aback by the idea of having to go\\nand see the police, and could only gape and stare foolishly. He\\nwas obviously not at all keen on the idea, and in any case he\\nwould not know how to go about discussing things with the\\npolice.\\n\\n“Ah, I can well imagine you’ve got stage-fright!” said Tseng\\nTsang-hai half reprovingly and half affectionately. He shook his\\nhead, then suddenly changed the subject:\\n\\n“Chia-chu, have you any idea how many secret opium-dens\\nthere are in the town? Do you know how many men go to see\\nMademoiselle San— the girl who lives behind the grocer’s shop\\nin Chien Street? And do you know how much is smuggled\\nthrough the customs barrier every month?”\\n\\nTseng Chia-chu just stared, not knowing what to say. As a\\nmatter of fact, he was a regular customer of ladies of the town\\nlike Mademoiselle San, but it was none of his business how many\\nmen they might be entertaining besides himself. As for opium-\\ndens and smuggled goods, he had never given them a thought.\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai slapped his thigh and laughed happily.\\n\\n“you don’t know? Naturally a young man dcesn’t bother his\\nhead about such things. But, now you’re a party man— one of\\nthe elite! If you’re going to do your job properly, you must get\\nto know about local conditions. You should go around and try\\nto find out about this and that. Information won’t come and\\nknock at your door. ... However, don’t worry: your old man\\nknows all the ropes and he’ll soon show you your way around!”\\n\\nTseng Chia-chu had turned red in the face, perhaps because\\nhe was ashamed of having his ignorance shown up by his father;\\nor it may have been that he was becoming impatient because the\\nhundred dollars had not yet materialized. He pursed his lips\\nand remained silent. Just then, his wife came in in high dudg-\\neon. She sat her child on a chair and put one arm round it,\\nthen turned to her husband as if she were going to say some-\\nthing, but before she could open her mouth the child started cry-\\ning. At the same time it wet itself: the chair was soaked and\\nsome dripped on to the floor.\\n\\nChia-chu scowled and screwed up his face with exasperation.\\nHe sat up abruptly on the couch and was just going to rave at\\n\\nhis wife, when he saw that the child was scrabbling his feet\\non the book he had just brought in.\\n\\n“Hey, you little beast!” he roared as he sprang forward and\\nsnatched the book from under the child’s feet. He looked at it:\\nit was dripping wet and torn beyond recognition. As he pulled\\nit out the child lost its balance and almost fell off the chair.\\nTerrified by the realization that it had done something wrong,\\nit stopped crying and took refuge in its mother’s bosom with its\\nlittle mouth wide open.\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai’s expression changed abruptly when he saw\\nthat the soiled book in his son’s hand was no other than The\\nThree Principles, a theoretical treatise of the Kuomintang. He\\nsprang off the couch and stamped his foot.\\n\\n“God Almighty!” he wailed. “Fancy letting the child wet all\\nover this of all books! If people get to hear about this, there\\'ll\\nbe hell to pay! Oh, God! What a thing to happen!”\\n\\nThe child, terrified, began howling again. Tseng Chia-chu did\\nnot really understand why his father should be making such a\\nfuss over a book; nevertheless, having a vague idea that some-\\nthing terrible had happened, he flew into a rage, and suddenly\\ncaught hold of his wife and began thrashing her. As the din\\nof howling from mother and child and shouting and cursing\\nfrom Chia-chu rose about his ears, Tseng Tsang-hai shook his\\nhead and sighed; there was nothing he could do but lie down\\nand smoke again. After a while he remembered that he had to\\ngo to the police station on important business, so he got up, shook\\ndown his long gown, and departed, leaving the pandemonium\\nbehind him.\\n\\n*\\n\\nThe streets were crowded as usual. Shuangchiao Town had a\\npopulation of nearly a hundred thousand and boasted a few local\\nbanks, pawnshops, silverware shops, as well as a power-house, 2\\nrice-mill and an oil-refinery owned by Wu Sun-fu. Most of these\\nestablishments had sprung up during the past four or five years.\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai walked with leisurely strides through the\\nstreets, looking at the shops and the modern places of amuse-\\nment, thinking that there were now many more opportunities of\\nmaking money than in days gone by when he had been the\\n“Local King.” If he had not had a run of bad luck for the last\\n\\ntwo or three years, he would doubtless have made a cool hundred\\nthousand dollars out of the boom. Although he had a chance of\\nmaking a come-back any day now, just the same, he couldn’t\\nhelp feeling regretful about what he had missed. He slowed\\ndown and had to stop in front of the Tai Pai Restaurant, so dense\\nwere the crowds.\\n\\nSuddenly a voice hailed him from behind: “Where are you\\noff to at such a moment?”\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai glanced over his shoulder, to see Li Sze, the\\nopium seller. In a way he and the opium-seller were intimate\\nfriends and did not stand on ceremony, but before so many peo-\\nple in the street Tseng Tsang-hai was embarrassed by the\\nfamiliar manner of this fellow who tugged at his sleeve and called\\nhim just plain “you.” Anybody would think an opium-seller\\nwas the social equal of a man who had always prided himself\\non his family and position. It irked Tseng Tsang-hai, but he\\ncould not very well say anything, as he had to reckon with the\\nfact that Li Sze’s underworld influence was growing daily with\\nthe mounting prosperity of the town. Restrained by this con-\\nsideration, he had to stifle his displeasure, and, in spite of him-\\nself, greeted Li Sze with a nod.\\n\\n“I’m going to the police station,” he replied with a smile, “on\\nsome official business.”\\n\\n“You\\'d better turn back,” Li Sze advised him pretentiously.\\n“Whatever your business, there’s nothing doing today.”\\n\\nHe spoke with a note of arrogance in his voice, as if he were\\nthe superintendent himself.\\n\\n“Why? Have they got a new superintendent?” asked Tseng\\nTsang-hai sarcastically, annoyed at the other’s tone of voice.\\nHardly were the words out of his mouth when he regretted it:\\nhe could not afford to offend an influential man like Li Sze.\\n\\nLuckily, Li Sze did not notice the implication. He led Tseng\\nTsang-hai over to a quiet spot across the street, where he put\\nhis mouth to the old man’s ear and whispered:\\n\\n“Haven’t you heard the news?”\\n\\n“What news?”\\n\\n“A Communist detachment’s arrived at Chilichiao Village.\\nThey’re coming to raid the town tonight!”\\n\\nAt this Tseng Tsang-hai’s heart missed a beat and he paled.\\nHe did not mind about there being Communists in Chilichiao and\\nthe news that they were coming to raid the town. What upset\\nhim was that Li Sze had stolen a march on him and that his secret\\nwas a secret no longer! The opportunity of gaining some kudos\\nfor himself or his son had slipped through his fingers. Yet, old\\nstager that he was, after the initial shock he immediately gather-\\ned his wits about him and shook his head in feigned disbelief.\\n\\n“You don’t believe it?” Li Sze went on in a confidential whisper.\\n“Listen, I’ll tell you something; there’s hardly anybody knows\\nabout it yet. I heard it from somebody at Colonel Ho’s place.\\nThe colonel’s concubine’s cleared out already. She went on\\nPockmarked Wang’s boat. True as I stand here!”\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai’s face was now quite ashen, for he had begun\\nto realize that the situation was really serious. When earlier\\nin the day he had heard from his labourer Ah Erh about the\\nmass meeting in Chilichiao Village and the beating of gongs and\\nso on, he had dismissed it as something staged by a lot of help-\\nless, unarmed peasants; but now it looked as if the Communists\\nwere armed and meant business. His fear was now not of some-\\none stealing his son’s thunder, but of losing his life and property.\\n\\n“How many rifles have the Communists got?” he asked\\nanxiously.\\n\\n“About a hundred, so I’ve heard.”\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai felt somewhat relieved. Although his plan\\nfor making a name for his son had fallen through, he was\\ncomforted by the thought that there was no real danger. He\\nsmiled and glanced at Li Sze’s cunning face.\\n\\n“Only a hundred?” he said calmly and unconcernedly. “Nothing\\nto be afraid of. We\\'ve got a whole battalion of troops stationed\\nhere.”\\n\\n“Yuh! We may have, but they haven’t been paid for three\\nmonths.”\\n\\n“And then there’s the local security force.”\\n\\n“Fleven out of ten of them opium-addicts!—I should advise\\nyou to be careful, though, and hide up for a while. It’s no joke,\\nthis time. There have been rumours flying about for the past\\ntwo days, but of course, you’ve been too busy cuddling your con-\\ncubine on the couch all day to notice what’s going on outside.\\n\\n—But it may not be as bad as all that. Though you\\'d better be\\ncareful and watch out. I don’t mind telling you I’ve given or-\\nders for my men all over the town to load their guns in case.\\nNo sleep for them tonight!”\\n\\nWith this Li Sze hurried off.\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai stood cog:tating a while but could not make\\nup his mind what to do. If he moved.out, it would cost him\\na lot of money. Better sit tight for the time being and risk\\nit. If anything really did happen, and his life and property were\\nthreatened, he could always take his cue from the battalion com-\\nmander’s concubine and slip away to the county town.. Now that\\nhe had no secret to win himself some glory with, there was no\\npoint in going to see the police superintendent, so he decided to\\ngo home.\\n\\nThere was someone waiting for him in the hall when he ar-\\nrived home. The moment Tseng Tsang-hai saw that the man\\nhad a little tuft of beard under his chin, he recognized him as\\nFei Hsiao-sheng, better known as. Fei Little Beard, Wu Sun-\\nfu’s agent in the town. :\\n\\n“Ah, you’re back, Mr. Tseng. I just came to tell you that\\nMr. Wu Sun-fu has sent me a wire asking for a hundred thou-\\nsand dollars to be remitted to him within three days. I should\\nlike your advice.”\\n\\nWhen Fei Little Beard came straight to the question of money,\\nTseng Tsang-hai’s face fell at once.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking through the books,” Fei Little Beard went\\non with a smile, “and I find that you owe Mr. Sun-fu’s local\\nbank here some twelve thousand dollars, and that the loan has\\nlong been overdue. I didn’t really want to mention it, but Mr.\\nWu sounded very strict in his letter and I haven’t managed to\\ncollect the whole amount, so I have to come and ask you to help\\nme out. I shall be very grateful for anything you can do to\\nhelp.”\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai’s face fell. There was no love lost between\\nhim and the agent. Tseng Tsang-hai had often told people\\nright and left that Fei Little Beard, during the several years he\\nhad been Wu Sun-fu’s caretaker, had lined his pocket at Wu\\nSun-fu’s expense, at the same time doing everything possible\\nto prejudice his nephew Wu Sun-fu against him, with the result\\n\\nthat all he could get in the way of a loan was a miserable twelve\\nthousand dollars. Now Fei Little Beard was coming round dun-\\nning him and giving himself airs as his master’s agent. Tseng\\nTsang-hai, deciding that he ought to be taken down a peg, an-\\nswered sarcastically:\\n\\n“You are a good and loyal servant to my nephew, Mr. Fei!\\nI’ll surely recommend you for promotion.—Now I have some\\nnews that will surprise you: my brother-in-law died soon after\\nhe arrived in Shanghai. I’ve had a telegram from my nephew\\nasking me to go to Shanghai and supervise the funeral. I’m\\nleaving tonight. As for the money, I\\'ll see him about it myself,\\nso you needn’t bother about it now.”\\n\\n“T see,” said Fei Little Beard, with a faint smile which hinted\\nthat he had seen through Tseng Tsang-hai’s bluff. “I’ve also\\nreceived a telegram from Mr. Wu Sun-fu about his father’s\\ndeath. But, of course, I didn’t know he’d asked you to go and\\nsupervise the funeral.”\\n\\nHe made no further mention of the money, but rose to go.\\nHe was just about to take his leave when Tseng Tsang-hai\\nstopped him.\\n\\n“What\\'s the hurry?” he said. “I’ve got something else to tell\\nyou.—Now, if Sun-fu wants as much as a hundred thousand dol-\\nlars, it must be for an emergency. Tell me how much you\\'ve\\ncollected so far.”\\n\\n“Only half the required amount, fifty thousand dollars.”\\n\\nFei Little Beard sat down again, still wearing a smile, but\\nimplying by his tone of voice that he was not altogether pleased\\nat Tseng Tsang-hai’s prying. Old fox as he was, Fei Little Beard\\nknew that Wu Sun-fu had not much respect for his uncle,\\nbut he was still his master’s uncle, and he didn’t dare be too\\nrude to him. But Tseng Tsang-hai’s high-handed manner was\\ngetting too much for him to stomach. The old man was definite-\\nly overreaching himself this time, putting on airs as if he were\\nsomebody of importance.\\n\\nBut, far from toning down his insolent manner, Tseng Tsang-\\nhai pursued:\\n\\n“Only fifty thousand? You haven\\'t sent it yet, I suppose?\\nWell, then, give it to me and I\\'ll take it to Sun-fu myself when\\nI go.”\\n\\nFei’s eyebrows shot up: he could hardly believe his ears.\\nHe tugged at his little beard and stared at Tseng Tsang-hai’s\\nthin face.\\n\\n“Go and fetch the money at once,” the latter continued firmly.\\n“you may hold me responsible for it. Don’t you know about\\nthe Communists in Chilichiao Village? They’re coming to raid\\nthe town this very night. We can’t leave all that money lying\\naround here tonight; I must take it with me to Shanghai. Sun-\\nfu’s interests are as important to me as my own. In this emer-\\ngency I can’t just stand by and see him lose money like that.”\\n\\n“Oh. . . that! Early this morning I heard the rumour and\\nsent Mr. Sun-fu a telegram asking for his instructions. If there\\nshould be any trouble tonight, I’ve made arrangements for look-\\ning after the money all right. After all, it’s my job and I\\nshouldn’t like to bother you about it.”\\n\\n“But could you really bear such a heavy responsibility in an\\nemergency such as this?”\\n\\n“Yes, I shall be all right, Mr. Tseng,” Fei Little Beard said\\nfirmly. “Thank you for your kind offer all the same.”\\n\\nHe rose to go, but suddenly sat down again and turned to look\\ninto Tseng Tsang-hai’s face, which betrayed his rage and mor-\\ntification.\\n\\n“Mr. Tseng,” he inquired, “where did you get the news that\\nthere’s going to be trouble tonight?”\\n\\n“Colonel Ho told me so himself, just after he’d received a\\nsecret report, and. . .er. . . it seemed as if Colonel Ho\\nwas a bit scared himself. Do you know who went to the county\\ntown on Pockmarked Wang’s boat this morning?”\\n\\n“Yes: Colonel Ho’s concubine, going to return a call from\\nthe Magistrate’s wife. —Ah, I see!. . . But I don’t suppose\\nyou’ve heard the news, Mr. Tseng: at two o\\'clock this afternoon\\nthe colonel told the Chamber of Commerce that he accepted\\nfull responsibility for the defence of the town. But he also said:\\n‘We haven’t been paid for three months. What about making\\nup the men’s pay to raise their morale?’ Then he asked them for\\na loan of thirty thousand dollars.”\\n\\n“Did the Chamber of Commerce let him have it?”\\n\\n“Of course it did—cash down. . . . Ah, it’s getting dark!\\nI must hurry off.... What time do you leave, Mr. Tseng?\\n\\nI’m afraid I shan’t be able to see you off on the boat. Please\\nforgive me.”\\n\\nFei Little Beard made a low bow, then made off in great\\nhaste.\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai hypocritically bowed Fei Little Beard out\\nof the hall, then came back fuming with rage. He paced round\\nthe hall grinding his teeth and groaning. During the past three\\nhours he had thought up many wonderful plans, but now they\\nhad all fizzled out. He had even failed to get that fifty thou-\\nsand dollars out of Fei Little Beard. He could not have hated\\nhim more if he had murdered his father.\\n\\nWhile searching in his mind for some means of revenge,\\nTseng Tsang-hai walked absently along a veranda to the door\\nof the lounge. Inside, on the opium-couch, a tiny yellow flame\\nwas dancing in the opium-lamp. <As he blundered in, there was\\na sudden scuffle and two dark figures sprang up on the couch.\\nEven in the dim light of the lamp he recognized one of them\\nas his son and the other as his concubine.\\n\\n“You swine!” he screamed.\\n\\nThen suddenly there was a mist before his eyes and he felt\\na burning sensation around his heart. As his legs gave way\\nbeneath him, he instinctively felt for a chair and collapsed\\nweakly on to it, his few straggling wisps of beard twitching\\nwith emotion.\\n\\nWhen the mist cleared, Ah-chin was gone and Tseng Chia-chu\\nwas crouching on the couch like a frightened dog, gazing ap-\\nprehensively at his father.\\n\\nHis son’s incest, Ah-chin’s brazenness, Fei Little Beard’s vil-\\nlainy, the Communist threat from Chilichiao Village — all these\\nwere seething and churning together in his mind. He wanted\\nto roar his resentment and reassert himself, but he did not know\\nquite where to begin. Finally his jealousy got the upper hand,\\nand he turned on his son.\\n\\n“you swine!” he raved hoarsely. “If you’re such a glutton,\\nyou might at least go and pick up your women outside: I\\nwouldn’t mind that. But you’d rather stay at home and have it\\non tap, wouldn’t you, you scum? If you put her in the family\\nway, what are you going to call it—brother or son? That bitch\\nAh-chin—”\\n\\nHe was cut short by the crackle of rifle-fire in the distance.\\nThis was the signal for an immediate outburst of prolonged fir-\\ning. It was like a firework display on New Year’s Eve. Tseng\\nTsang-hai jumped and cried frantically:\\n\\n“Oh, God! We\\'re done for!—Come on, you young swine, get\\noutside and see what’s happening, and quick about it! See which\\ndirection they’re coming from and how far away they are!”\\n\\nBut Tseng Chia-chu did not budge; he just cowered down even\\nlower. Suddenly Ah-chin- rushed in sobbing and wailing, her\\ndishevelled hair hanging over her face. She clutched hold of\\nTseng Tsang-hai and wrapped herself round him like a snake.\\n\\n“It was your son made me do it!” she sobbed. “I tried to stop\\nhim, but he, he—”\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai knocked her away with a vicious slap in the\\nface; he was too enraged to say anything. Meanwhile, the sound\\nof firing was coming nearer, and angry shouts could be heard\\nin the street. Chia-chu’s wife ran in crying with her baby in\\nher arms, followed by a whole troop of women nurses, kitchen-\\nmaids and chamber-maids, in a terrified, hysterical flock.\\n\\nSuddenly the firing became louder than before and the stutter\\nof a machine-gun was added to the noise. The old man was\\nrushing in mortal terror into the back of the house when his\\nservant Ah Erh dashed in, running into him full tilt and throw-\\ning him to the floor.\\n\\n“Quick!” gasped Ah Erh, with not even a glance at his master.\\n“Hide in the back, in the kitchen-garden! And keep your heacs\\ndown! There’s bullets flying about everywhere and soldiers all\\nover the place—all round the house!”\\n\\n“So the Communists are on the run, are they?” asked Tseng\\nTsang-hai gleefully, scrambling to his feet with a sudden spurt\\nof energy and clutching at Ah Erh’s sleeve.\\n\\nIt’s the soldiers fighting the security force ... the soldiers\\nare fighting among themselves!”\\n\\n“Teha! Get out with your blasted drivel!” snarled Tseng\\nTsang-hai, the master again, when he heard Ah Erh’s reply.\\nLooking round sharply, he saw a red glow reflected on the walls\\nround the yard—somewhere down the street a fire was blazing\\naway. The staccato chatter of a machine-gun was heard again.\\nSupposing that the worst was over, Tseng Tsang-hai ordered the\\n\\nwomen to collect up all the valuables and some clothes, while\\nhe himself took the opium-lamp and went over to a desk in the\\ncorner of the room, where he opened a deed-box and took out\\na large sheaf of land-deeds, IOUs and passbooks and stuffed them\\ninto his pockets. His son suddenly sprang off the opium-couch,\\nwhere he had been crouching motionless all the while, and\\njoined his father in the rummage. Suddenly there was a noise\\nof shouting which seemed to come from just behind them. Tseng\\nTsang-hai dropped the papers in terror and ran towards the\\nbackroom: but in the dark doorway he bumped into someone\\nand a hand clutched at his sleeve.\\n\\n“Oh, save me from them, sir!” wailed a woman’s voice.\\n\\nIt was Ah-chin again. Just at that moment a flaring light\\nlit up the room from outside and in the glare Tseng Tsang-hai\\nsaw several men, each with a torch in his hand. When Ah-\\nchin recognized, one of them as her husband, she was terrified.\\nHer knees gave way beneath her and she sank to the floor, where\\nshe buried her face in her hands and collapsed in a heap.\\nTseng Tsang-hai took advantage of the confusion to make his\\nescape. He fied blindly and in a twinkling he had vanished.\\n\\n“Now, you shameless hussy!” thundered Ah-chin’s husband.\\n“where is the old swine?” But Ah-chin just sobbed. Two of\\nthe men had caught hold of Chia-chu and were hustling him over\\nto a young man who was standing there.\\n\\n“The old perisher’s bolted out the back way!”\\n\\n“No need to go after him, Chin-pao,” cried several voices\\ntogether. “The lads out the back’ll spot him all right.”\\n\\nJust then, Chia-chu’s wife burst into the room, her hair all\\nover her face. Seeing her husband held by two men, she hurled\\nherself upon them; but someone seized her by the hair from\\nbehind and pulled her sharply off.\\n\\n“what do you think you’re on?” he roared.\\n\\n“What am I on? What have you got hola of my husband\\nfor?”\\n\\nShe threw herself to the floor and began screaming hysteri-\\ncally. Seeing Ah-chin squatting nearby, she rolled over, seized\\nhold of her with both hands, and bit her shoulder savagely.\\nIn a moment the two women were fighting in a heap on the floor.\\n\\n“you are the cause of all the trouble, you bitch!... You\\ndon’t care whether they’re old or young—you\\'ll have them\\nall...) . VU kill you! W’ll kill you!”\\n\\nShouts were heard and torches flashed in the back of the\\nhouse, and soon three men, one of whom was Ah Erh, dragged\\nTseng Tsang-hai into the room. The old man was smothered\\nin dirt from head to foot, and was desperately imploring them\\nto spare his life. Ah-chin’s husband darted forward and crashed\\nhis fist into his face.\\n\\n“You old swine!” he rasped through clenched teeth. “Don’t\\nwant to die, eh?”\\n\\n“Kill him! Lynch him, the bloody old shark!”\\n\\nA sudden roar of anger swept through the room, but the\\nyoung man wearing a pistol came across and restrained them.\\n\\n“Shut up, all of you!” he rapped out sternly. “He\\'ll be tried first!”\\n\\n“Come on, then: let’s try him! He’s a money-lender, a blood-\\nsucker! He took my farm, the old shark! .. .”\\n\\n“The old swine took my wife and had me beaten up by the\\npolice!”\\n\\n“He\\'s always setting the police on us! He ought to be lynched!”\\n\\n“Ah! and I suppose you\\'re in the Kuomintang as well, aren’t\\nyou?” cried the young man with a pistol, raising his voice\\nabove the din.\\n\\nTseng Tsang-hai’s heart missed a beat at this question. For\\nsome inexplicable reason he decided that there was hope for him\\nyet. He pulled himself together and looked at the young man\\nstraight in the eye in the glare of the torchlight.\\n\\n“No, not at all,” he assured him vehemently. “No one hates\\nthe Kuomintang more than I do. I’ve had quite a number of\\nthem arrested and shot in my time. If you don’t believe me, you\\ncan make an investigation—Oh, yes, Ah Erh here can tell you\\nabout it, Ah Erh, . . .”\\n\\n“If you were not in the Kuomintang before, I am sure you are\\nnow!”\\n\\nThe young man cut him short. With a glance at Chia-chu,\\nwho was gazing at him with startled eyes, he continued, “And\\nwhat’s your son?”\\n\\n“Ym not. one! I’m not in the Kuomintang!” Tseng Chia-chu\\nprotested desperately. But hardly were the words out of his\\n\\nmouth when Ah-chin, who had stopped fighting for the moment,\\nsprang up and shrieked:\\n\\n“Oh yes you are! Just now you showed me that black card\\nand threatened me with it and made me. . . . Oh, forgive\\nme, Chin-pao! They forced me to do it. I couldn\\'t stop them.”\\n\\nThen the machine-gun fire started up again. The young man\\nglanced outside, then pulled out his pistol and shouted:\\n\\n“Two of you stay here on guard. The rest of you come with\\nme and bring the old shark and his son with you.”\\n\\nAs they clattered out with their flaring torches, Tseng Chia-\\nchu’s wife, who had been sitting on the floor gaping blankly,\\nnow sprang up and ran weeping after them. Just as she got\\noutside, she tripped over something and fell flat on her face.\\nAh Erh, who had been left behind on guard with another man,\\nhelped her to her feet.\\n\\n“Have you gone off your head?” he cried roughly. Then,\\nas if to console her, “It’s nothing to do with you. They\\'re\\nthe ones who’ve done wrong and they’ll have to suffer for it,\\nnot you. Now get in the back, and don’t go rushing about.”\\n\\n*\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tseng Tsang-hai and his son were being hustled\\nthrough the streets, where they saw peasants in red scarves and\\narmed with a varied assortment of weapons, running here and\\nthere in twos and threes. They brushed past Li Sze, the opium-\\nseller, who was being walked away by a group of unarmed\\npeasants. Tseng Tsang-hai tried to catch his eye, but he was\\nhurried by so quickly that even this was not possible. They\\nwere now heading west, in the direction of the firing. Every\\ntwo or three minutes came the angry chatter of a machine-gun.\\nAll the shops and houses were shuttered and barred, with an\\noccasional ray of light escaping through the crack of a door.\\n\\nGusts of wind carried smoke and smuts and a smell of burning\\n—somewhere another fire was blazing away.\\n\\nAfter turning a corner they found their way blocked by a\\nmilling crowd. Not far ahead was the high front wall of the\\nHung Chang Pawnshop. The two Tsengs and their captors were\\nsoon swallowed up in the motley, jostling crowd of variously\\narmed peasants and soldiers in red scarves. Suddenly, from\\n\\nthe top of the pawnshop wall, there was flash and a burst of\\nmachine-gun fire raked the street below. The Tsengs, at the\\ncorner of the street, suddenly found themselves in the line of\\nfire.\\n\\n“Scatter! Quick!” thundered a voice from the middle of the\\ncrowd. Tseng Tsang-hai and Chia-chu were bundled across the\\nstreet by their captors and they all lay flat under the eaves of a\\nshop while rifles cracked all round them. Tseng Tsang-hai looked\\nlike a corpse, except that his staring eyes still rolled in terror.\\nChia-chu’s terrified gaze was riveted on the flashes from the\\nmuzzle of the machine-gun ahead of him. There was a sudden\\ncrackle of rifie-fire from behind the pawnshop and a plume of\\nsmoke curled up against the sky. As it thickened, a red glow\\nappeared and tongues of flame shot upwards: the pawnshop\\nwas on fire. The machine-gun fire died down a little, and at\\nthe same time a deafening roar rose around them.\\n\\n“Charge! Charge!”\\n\\nInnumerable figures sprang up from the ground and from their\\nhiding-places round corners and under the eaves of the shops,\\nthen charged forward like a whirlwind.\\n\\nThe men guarding the Tsengs joined in the charge, but two\\nof them immediately turned back and withdrew with their pris-\\noners down the street. Before the four of them had gone more\\nthan a few steps, the machine-gun on the pawnshop wall raked\\nthe street with final burst, and they threw themselves to the\\nground. Another wave of peasants and red-scarfed soldiers\\ncame rushing up the street towards the pawnshop and swept\\nover them as they lay there.\\n\\nThe chatter of the machine-gun gradually petered out.\\n\\nTseng Chia-chu, hugging the ground, at first thought it was\\nall up with him. Then he tentatively moved his limbs and\\nfound, to his surprise, that he was intact and unhurt. He sat\\nup and looked at his father: he was doubled up on his side,\\nwith blood oozing from his gaping mouth. The two peasants\\nwere also dead. Tseng Chia-chu gazed in stunned silence for a\\nmoment, then sprang up and ran for his life.\\n\\nPanic-stricken, he ran into a deserted lane. He tripped over\\nsomething and fell, but bounced up again immediately. He\\n\\ninstinctively looked over his shoulder in the direction of the\\npawnshop and saw the flames leaping up against the sky and\\nshedding a red glow all round. Shouts and cries could still be\\nheard against the background of intermittent rifle-fire. While\\nhis attention was distracted, he again stumbled against the ob-\\nject on the ground. He automatically looked down: it was a\\ndead man with a red scarf around his neck and a pistol still in\\nhis hand. An idea suddenly took shape in Chia-chu’s mind:\\nhe unwound the red scarf from the dead man’s neck and wound\\nit around his own, then snatched the pistol from his hand and\\nran on.\\n\\nThe firing had now almost ceased, and all that could be\\nheard were the crackle of the fire and the confused clamour of\\nvoices in the distance. The lane was as quiet as the grave:\\nevery door was shut fast, and there was not a glimmer of light\\nto be seen. Chia-chu continued on his way, peering right and\\nleft as he went like a hungry stray dog on the prowl. As he\\nneared the end of the lane he suddenly stopped. In front of him\\nstood a two-storeyed house with a light in the window. He\\nhesitated a moment, then went up and knocked at the gate, a\\nsavage gleam in his eye.\\n\\n“Thank God, you’re back!” came a young woman’s voice as\\nthe gate opened, but when she saw it was a stranger standing\\nthere pointing a pistol at her with murder in his eyes, she let\\nout a scream and ran back into the house. Chia-chu ran after\\nher without a word. They ran across the yard and as she\\nreached the door of the room with a light in the window, the\\nwoman tripped over. Disregarding her, Chia-chu burst into\\nthe room, where he was met by the terrifted face of a wrinkled\\nold woman and vaguely heard her shriek.\\n\\nHe bounded up the stairs and into a bedroom. A lamp was\\nburning and the bed was hung round with a white curtain. He\\nripped the curtains aside and saw a child’s rosy little face above\\na green silk quilt. He quickly raised the quilt and let it fall\\nback, then whirled round and made for a wardrobe. He flung.\\nopen the door and began rummaging around inside.\\n\\n“Mummy! Mummy!” the child began crying. Chia-chu started\\nat the noise and in a panic he fired at the bed. The deafening\\n\\nreport sounded even louder and more appalling in the stillness\\nof the little room. Startled, Chia-chu let the pistol drop to the\\nground. The child cried louder still, and footsteps pounded up\\nthe stairs. The next moment the young woman burst screaming\\ninto the room and flung herself at the bed. She picked up the\\nchild and, hugging it to her, she leant motionless as a statue\\nagainst a table by the bed and stared dumbly at the intruder.\\n\\nMore out of instinct than anything, Chia-chu picked up the\\npistol and aimed it at the mother and her child, his face as\\nblack as thunder and his heart thumping wildly. As he stood\\nthere, the old woman tottered in and fell trembling on her knees\\nin front of him.\\n\\n“Don’t kill us, kind sir! Please don’t kill us! Take our jewel-\\nlery and money, but don’t—”\\n\\n“Give ’em here, then! And quick about it!” Chia-chu rapped\\nout, feeling calmer and dropping the muzzle of the pistol towards\\nthe floor.\\n\\nThe child began whimpering again, murmuring “mummy” and\\nburying its face against the young woman’s breast. She smiled\\na little to know that her baby was still alive.\\n\\nChia-chu’s heart beat faster, for he suddenly recognized her\\nnow that she had smiled: she was the wife of a haberdasher in\\nthe main street, a woman he had often gazed at with lustful\\neyes. He glanced from her to his pistol, then stepped forward.\\nHe suddenly seized hold of her, flung her on to the bed, and\\ntried to strip her. She was so stunned by this sudden assault\\nthat for a moment she seemed paralysed but she soon gathered\\nher wits about her and began resisting frantically, her blazing\\neyes riveted on Chia-chu’s savage face.\\n\\n“Please spare us, your honour! Have mercy on us! Please\\nleave her alone!” shrieked the old woman desperately, her\\nvoice quavering with emotion. She tottered over, grasped his\\nlegs, and tried to pull him off. The trinkets and silver coins she\\nhad brought for him spilled out jingling on ‘to the floor.\\n\\n“Keep off!’ Chia-chu roared, and viciously kicked the old\\nwoman away. As he did so, the young woman wrenched herseif\\naway from him, rolled out of his reach and sprang to her feet.\\n\\nli\\n“Now I know who you are!” she shrilled hysterically. “I know\\nyou! you\\'re that old shark Tseng Tsang-hai’s son! That\\'s who\\nyou are!”\\n\\nChia-chu’s face became suffused with rage. In a panic he\\npicked up the pistol from the edge of the bed and fired point-\\nblank at the young woman.\\nVv\\n\\nTwo days later, the Shanghai newspapers reported the peasant\\nrising in Shuangchiao Town in a few lines in obscure corners.\\nSuch occurrences had, of late, become so frequent that they had\\nlost their news-value, and in any case they only upset the readers,\\nso the papers kept such news-items down to a minimum. Besides,\\nthe readers had got so used to news of this kind that they treated\\nthem just as they did the frequent cases of kidnapping in the\\ncity: they just glanced over such items and thought to themselves:\\n“What, again?” at the same time congratulating themselves that\\nthe place in question did not happen to be their own home town.\\n\\nThe long years of increasingly violent civil war and peasant\\nunrest had, in a way, trained the rich in the virtue of keeping\\ncalm — although their fear of finding themselves involved in a\\nsudden upheaval also grew with each passing day.\\n\\nIt was with mixed feeling that Wu Sun-fu read the news about\\nhis home town in the morning paper. He had just finished\\nbreakfast and was sprawled on the sofa with his paper, while. his\\nwife sat opposite him on a chair, puckering her brows slightly\\nand looking cross and depressed. Suddenly Wu Sun-fu threw the\\nnewspaper aside and laughed ironically.\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu’s heart missed a beat. She nerved herself to\\nlook at her husband, though her face had paled slightly. Sensi-\\ntive as she was, she thought he was sneering at her. He must\\nhave found out her secret! Her pallor suddenly turned to a\\nflush of shame.\\n\\n“What’s the matter, Pei-yao?” asked Wu Sun-fu tautly, as if\\nmaking an effort to control himself. “Humph! It had to be, I\\nsuppose, and now it’s happened!”\\n\\nShe felt his dreadful; piercing eyes searching her face.\\n\\nHer face paled again, and her heart began thumping with fear.\\nThen something seemed to snap inside her head and she sud-\\ndenly decided to make a clean breast of everything. The thought\\nof her husband making a scene gave an ugly look to her face.\\n\\nBut Wu Sun-fu was too engrossed in his worries about Shuang-\\nchiao to notice her unusual mood. He swung himself off the\\nsofa and paced up and down, shaking his fists angrily. He stopped\\nand looked down at his wife’s bent head.\\n\\n“So it?s happened at last,’ he muttered to himself. “Oh!\\nShuangchiao Town! Three years ago, my ideal—”\\n\\n“Shuangchiao Town?” she interrupted, looking up sharply. She\\nsuddenly realized that his ironical laugh and “it’s happened”\\nreferred to something else. She felt slightly relieved but rather\\nashamed of herself. She could not suppress a blush, and the\\nexpression in her eyes was one of mortification and guilt. She\\nfelt sorry for her husband, and if at this moment he had shown\\nher a little love, she would willingly have buried her head in his\\nshoulder and told him everything. She would have told him\\nshe was sorry and would have sworn to be a good and faithful\\nwife to him.\\n\\nBut Wu Sun-fu merely laid his hand lightly on her shoulder\\nand said dully:\\n\\n“yes. A mob of rebellious peasants has broken into our home\\ntown. For three years I’ve spared no effort to try and build it\\nup into a model town, and now it’s all finished! Oh, Pei-yao,\\nPei-yao!”\\n\\nThis cri du coeur acted electrically on her and she imme-\\ndiately warmed to him. But when she looked up at his face,\\nshe sensed straight away that this cry was not for her but for\\nhis Shuangchiao Town, his “ideal of a model town.” She went\\ncold again and felt like bursting into tears.\\n\\n“Two or three months ago I began to fear that trouble of this\\nkind was brewing,” he continued, quite unaware of the con-\\nflicting emotions in his wife’s mind. “And now the inevitable’s\\nhappened!...\\n\\nHe narrowed his eyes and looked past her, then suddenly ex-\\nploded furiously.\\n\\n“How I hate them—those idiots in charge of the town! What\\nthe hell were they doing? They’ve got a whole battalion there\\n\\n”\\n\\nand two machine-guns! Are they afraid of hurting somebody,\\nor what? Pah!—And what the devil’s that idiot Fei Little Beard\\nup to? I suppose he’s dead! He hasn’t even answered my tele-\\ngram. A whole day’s gone by, and still not a word from him!\\nIf I hadn’t happened to see the news in the paper, I’d never have\\nknown! We might as well be waiting in the dark to have our\\nthroats cut, for all we know about what’s going on!”\\n\\nHe stamped his foot, then threw himself fuming on to the\\nsofa. He picked up the paper, glanced at it with a frown, and\\nthrew it aside. He switched his narrowed eyes to his wife. Her\\nsilence exasperated him.\\n\\n“Pei-yao,” he demanded as calmly as he could, “why don’t you\\nsay something? What are you thinking about?”\\n\\n“Well, er, I should say ... well, one’s ideals are bound to fall\\nto the ground sooner or later.”\\n\\n“What on earth do you mean? ...” he bellowed angrily, his\\neyes bulging with indignation. Then suddenly he fell silent,\\npicked up the paper again, and held it up in front of his face.\\nHe was not really reading it but just fuming inwardly behind\\nit. He was firmly convinced that his anger was “justifiable” in\\nthe circumstances. Normally, he was calm, firm and full of\\nself-confidence; for he knew how to fight his opponents. He\\ncould be cruel, but he could also be smooth and sly. He might\\nsometimes storm and rage, but that did not necessarily mean\\nhe was really angry. What made him really angry was when\\nhe found his own men muddling and bungling, as he had the\\nday before yesterday with Mo Kan-cheng; and at times like that\\nhe became so angry that his health was threatened. But now\\nhe was more furious than ever, now that Shuangchiao Town had\\nfallen to the rebels, because his arm, long as it was, could not\\nreach those responsible for the fiasco.\\n\\nHis thoughts travelled from those responsible for keeping the\\npeace in Shuangchiao to their superiors in the county, in the\\nprovince, and even to the supreme authorities responsible for\\nthe whole country. The more he thought about it, the more mud-\\ndled and upset he became. He threw down his paper and stared\\ndown absently at the carpet with its modern designs and the\\nparquet floor around it, as he sat there as motionless as a statue.\\n\\nThe exquisitely furnished room was silent except for the rustle\\nof the parrot in its cage as it preened its feathers.\\n\\nThe butler Kao Sheng opened the door quietly and peered\\nround it. Sensing the tense atmosphere, he suddenly hesitated\\nas if he had been struck dumb and stood transfixed in the door-\\nway, not knowing whether to come in or not, his eyes appealing\\nmutely to his mistress.\\n\\n“what is it?” asked Mrs. Wu Sun-fu irritably, glancing at her\\nhusband as she spoke. Wu Sun-fu looked up sharply to see\\nKao Sheng with a couple of visiting cards in his hand.\\n\\n“All right,” he said gruffly, with a gesture of impatience.\\n“Show them into the drawing-room.”\\n\\nHe stood up and paced to and fro for a moment, then looked\\nat himself in the mirror to make sure that his expression was\\nback to normal. Satisfied, he went across to his wife and patted\\nher gently on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Pei-yao,” he said, “for two days now you\\'ve looked worried\\nand rather depressed. Don’t fret so much about things: Yu\\nthink of something! You’ve always been delicate.”\\n\\nHe took her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze, as if to trans-\\nfuse some of his own courage and optimism into her. Without\\nwaiting to see what effect his words had had, he let go of her\\nhand and strode out of the room.\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu leaned back in her chair, her head resting\\non the top of the back and her eyes brimming with tears. She\\nunderstood what her husband had said, every word of it, but she\\nknew, too, that she would never be able to make him understand\\nher own thoughts and feelings: he was too engrossed in his\\n“pusiness” for that. A strange sensation welled up inside her,\\nbut whether it was one of bitterness or pleasure she could not\\ntell.\\n\\n*\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was smiling as he stepped into the drawing-room.\\nThe first to rise and greet him was Tang Yun-shan.\\n\\n“Sun-ful” he cried, and began sympathetically: “I hear your\\nhome town has been captured by the rebels. It just proves how\\nincompetent the provincial authorities are!”\\n\\n“We\\'ve only just seen the news in the morning papers,” broke\\nin Wang Ho-fu, gripping Wu Sun-fu’s hand and sighing sympathet-\\n\\nically. “But I suppose you’ve had a detailed report from your\\npeople in the town. Is it really as bad as the papers say, after\\nall? They say there were quite a lot of troops stationed there—\\na whole battalion, wasn’t it? How on earth did they let it\\nhappen?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled and asked his visitors to sit down.\\n\\n“It’s only in China,” he began calmly, “that you find this\\nstrange phenomenon: our bandits are quite extraordinary in their\\nviolence.—I’ve only just read about it myself in the morning\\npapers. No other news has come through yet. I’ve no idea how\\nbad the situation really is, and I don’t know what to do about\\nit—But where’s Sun Chi-jen got to?”\\n\\n“He’s been detained on business,” muttered Tang Yun-shan in\\nreply, lighting a cigarette. “He asked me to stand in for him.”\\n\\nWhile he was trying to speak and draw on his cigarette at the\\nsame time, the smoke caught in his throat and made him cough.\\n\\n“We didn’t choose a very fortunate moment for our meeting,”\\nsaid Wang Ho-fu tactfully, with a smile at Wu Sun-fu, “just when\\nthere’s been trouble in your home town. As you\\'ve only just\\nheard the news yourself, I’ve no doubt you’ll be busy enough\\ntoday making arrangements, so I suggest we put off our meet-\\ning to another day.”\\n\\nBefore Wu Sun-fu could reply, Tang Yun-shan jumped in first.\\n\\n“Out of the question!” he cried. “I don’t imagine for one\\nmoment that Sun-fu will agree to that. Sun-fu’s no milksop:\\nhe’s a man of action and initiative. I’ve yet to see him dithering\\nand dawdling over anything! And when it comes to a piddling\\nlittle problem like this, he just slaps on his thinking-cap and\\nthere you are—it’s solved! Well, don’t let’s waste any more time!\\nLet’s get down to business!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu and Wu Sun-fu could not help smiling at the tone\\nof voice in which he said this: it was the one he always used\\nwhen dealing with politicians and party officials.\\n\\n“Well, so far as Tu Chu-chai’s concerned,” began Wu Sun-fu,\\ngetting down to the matter in hand, “I’ve discussed it with him\\ntwice already, and he\\'ll probably come in with us, I think. But\\nhe won’t be able to make up his mind for sure until after the\\nDragon-boat Festival. He always takes his time, you know, and\\nthat’s his strong point. I should say there is a four-to-one chance\\n\\nof his coming in on it. If you remember, gentlemen, we decided\\nthe night before last to work on the principle of keeping our\\nnumbers down when necessary. In view of this I don’t think we\\nshould co-opt Chu Yin-chiu, Chen Chun-yi and Chou Chung-wei.\\n—Though, of course, the decision on that rests with you two\\ngentlemen.”\\n\\n“will there be enough of us without them, then?” interjected\\nTang Yun-shan anxiously, then cackled inanely.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled without answering, knowing well that all\\nTang Yun-shan wanted was to rope in a whole group of indus-\\ntrialists, regardless of whether they had any capital or not,\\nand organize them into a body which would engage in political\\nactivities. And when it came to the tortuous mazes behind the\\nscenes of the business world, Tang Yun-shan was a complete\\nnovice. Wu Sun-fu, who had been to Europe and America, was\\nnot an old-fashioned merchant, but a modern industrialist, and\\nalthough he always kept one eye on politics, his main attention\\nwas firmly on the profit-and-loss aspect of his business, and from\\nthis aspect it never for one moment wavered.\\n\\nWang Ho-fu had just been sitting there with a smile on his\\nlips, stroking his moustache and nodding; when he saw that\\nWu Sun-fu just smiled faintly in reply to Tang Yun-shan’s ques-\\ntion, he intervened himself.\\n\\n“What do you mean, Yun-shan?” he asked. “Are you afraid\\nof someone else snapping them up?—yYou needn’t worry about\\nthat!: I used to think Chou Chung-wei and Chen Chun-yi had\\npots of money, seeing that they started off as compradores, and\\nthat’s why I had ideas of including them. But now I under-\\nstand from Sun-fu they’ve got nothing left but their signboards.\\nIn business, whether you\\'re setting up a bank or anything else,\\nyou must be realistic. You can’t afford to run a business as a\\nsweepstake.-Don’t you agree, Sun-fu?”\\n\\n“All right, all right!” interjected Tang Yun-shan hastily. “IU\\naccept the decision of the majority.” Then, with a rapid glance\\nat his companions’ faces, he opened his briefcase and took out\\na large folder.\\n\\n“Now, I have here,” he went on, “Sun Chi-jen’s draft plan\\nfor the project. Shall we look at it now?”\\n\\nThe “draft plan” turned out to be a brief note containing a few\\nlines on three points: firstly, a capital of five million dollars,\\none-third of which to be collected first; secondly, a few new\\nenterprises—textiles, buses, mines, chemicals; and thirdly,\\nfinancial aid for several enterprises already in existence—certain\\nsilk factories, silk goods manufactories and steamship companies.\\nAs a matter of fact, it was no more than a summary of various\\npoints which had been brought up on a previous occasion.\\n\\nAs Wu Sun-fu glanced over the “plan,” the words conjured\\nup in his mind visions of a forest of tall chimneys belching black\\nsmoke, a fleet of merchantmen breasting the waves and a column\\nof buses speeding through the countryside. He smiled with satis-\\nfaction. These were no castles in the air. An experienced in-\\ndustrialist like him did not mind a humble beginning so long\\nas he had a large-scale plan to work to. This optimism was\\nconfirmed by the experience which he had accumulated in build-\\ning up his home town from scratch. His first step had been to\\nset up a small power-house in Shuangchiao Town as the starting\\npoint for building up his “Shuangchiao kingdom.” There, his\\nachievements had not been insignificant; but his scope had been\\nlimited by the small population—barely a hundred thousand.\\nHis activities in Shuangchiao Town had been mere child’s play\\ncompared with this present scheme.\\n\\nAs he reflected along these lines, Wu Sun-fu felt that the fall\\nof Shuangchiao Town was not such a terrible blow after all.\\nHis pimply face shone with excitement as he laid Sun Chi-jen’s\\n“draft plan” on the table. He looked at Wang Ho-fu and was\\ngoing to say something to him, when Tang Yun-shan unexpectedly\\ninterjected:\\n\\n“Since we\\'re not going to ask Chu Yin-chiu and the rest of\\nthem to come in with us, why should their factories be included\\nfor financial assistance? Isn’t that being rather inconsistent?—\\nOf course,” he added hastily, with a self-conscious laugh, “I don’t\\nreally understand all the ins and outs of the business—I just\\nwondered, that’s all.”\\n\\nThere was a note of suspicion in Tang Yun-shan’s voice: al-\\n‘though he didn’t quite understand what it was all about, he\\n.seemed nevertheless to have a shrewd idea that there was a catch\\nin it somewhere.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu and Wang Ho-fu exchanged amused glances and\\nburst out laughing. They turned to look at Tang Yun-shan’s\\nface with its mixture of cunning and naivety, then he, too, burst\\nout laughing. Not expecting to get an answer from either of\\nthem, he picked up the plan and looked through it for something\\nelse to talk about, but Wu Sun-fu snatched it from him and said:\\n\\n“There’s something in what you say, Yun-shan. Anyway, since\\nyou’re one of us now and are going to be manager of our bank\\nor whatever it is, we ought to let you in on what’s going to\\nhappen. Well, now, the reason we want to keep Chu Yin-chiu\\nand the others out of it is because they have no capital and if\\nthey come in they’ll be partners in name only and won\\'t be\\nany earthly use to the business. On the other hand, their fac-\\ntories are a part, however small, of Chinese-owned industry.\\nThey are now going downhill and it looks as if they\\'ll soon have\\nto close down. I£ they do, it’ll be a loss to our national industry.\\nIf they are eventually bought out by foreign interests in Shang-\\nhai, it’ll mean an increase in foreign influence in China and an\\neven greater loss to Chinese industry. So it’s up to us to assist\\nthem for the good of Chinese industry. It’s in pursuance of\\nthis aim that all the enterprises earmarked for aid in the plan\\nhave been included.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu stopped abruptly, bringing his forefinger down with\\na crack on the table to emphasize his point, his face beaming\\nself-righteously. He spoke with such earnestness and lucidity\\nthat he made Tang Yun-shan feel rather small and regret his\\nsuspicions. Even Wang Ho-fu, his customary smile replaced by\\nan air of seriousness, was deeply impressed by Wu Sun-fu’s\\narguments.\\n\\n“You\\'re quite right, Sun-fu,” he agreed solemnly. “I can see\\nyou have the country’s best interests at heart. Chinese indus-\\ntries have been going for about fifty or sixty years now, and,\\neven if we don’t count the government enterprises run by such\\nmen as Li Hung-chang in the Ching dynasty, there have still been\\nscores of privately run industries; but what success have they\\nhad? It’s always been the same old story: through mismanage-\\nment, most of them have gone broke and fallen into the hands\\nef foreign businessmen. —I tell you, Yun-shan, it’s a crying\\nshame when an enterprise is left in the hands of incompetent\\n\\nfools. They do neither themselves nor their country any good,\\nand in the end they play into the hands of the foreigners. So\\nwe must be careful not to bungle things in the same way in our\\nown enterprise, and if necessary we must advise even our closest\\nrelatives and friends to stop playing the fool, and make way for\\nsomebody who can do the job properly.”\\n\\nTang Yun-shan burst out laughing again. Now he understood\\nwhat it was all about. He was not so stupid, after all.\\n\\nThe three of them then got down to discussing some of the\\nnew enterprises included in the plan. No longer an “outsider,”\\nTang Yun-shan began to feel almost like an expert. He quoted\\nfreely from the section on “Industrial Construction” in Dr. Sun\\nYat-sen’s book Plan for China’s Construction. He held that, as\\nsoon as the civil war was over, genuine democracy would be\\nput into practice, and Sun Yat-sen’s projects, the “Great Eastern\\nHarbour” and the “Four Big Trunk Railways,” would be built\\nin a very short space of time. In view of this, he suggested\\nthat they should invest now in sites close to the projected great\\nharbour and the railway lines for their future enterprises. As\\nhe put this to them, he opened his briefcase and fished out a\\nmap. He then marked certain spots on it with a pencil, giving\\nan enthusiastic commentary as he did so. When he had finished,\\nhe drew a sigh of relief, as if he had just completed a monu-\\nmental task, and turned to his two industrialist friends.\\n\\n“Well, gentlemen, what do you think of my idea?” he beamed.\\n“Sun Chi-jen thinks quite highly of it. Later on I\\'ll draw up a\\nmore detailed plan in writing so that we can publish it when\\nwe get going and advertise for shares in the bank.”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu had nothing against it, but he hesitated to commit\\nhimself. Instead, he turned and looked expectantly at Wu Sun-\\nfu, waiting for him to give his opinion first, for he considered\\nWu Sun-fu wiser, more resourceful and more decisive than\\nhimself.\\n\\nBut, strange to say, Wu Sun-fu, who was known for his drive\\nand ability to make snap decisions, now hesitated and looked\\nworried, for in his opinion the “Great Eastern Harbour” and the\\nrailways were so many castles in the air. It is true he was im-\\naginative, but he was also a realist. He always believed in incor-\\nporating a high ideal in a plan at the very outset and keeping\\n\\nit in view as one’s ultimate objective, but he would not accept\\na mere castle in the air. After a moment’s hesitation he said\\nwith a reluctant smile:\\n\\n“Yes, I suppose that’s not a bad idea. We need something in\\nthe way of an attractive signboard. Actually, our plan could\\nconsist of two parts: Yun-shan’s idea for the first part, and Sun\\nChi-jen’s draft for the second; we could call the first part the\\nexternal aspect and the second the internal aspect, the first being\\nfor public consumption as our ultimate objective and the second\\nconstituting our immediate objective. In this way, we\\'ll have\\nsomething solid to get on with, and then one day, when the\\n‘Great Eastern Harbour’ and so on have been completed, we\\'ll\\nbe able to expand even more. How does that sound to you,\\nHo-fu?”\\n\\n“A capital idea!’ Wang Ho-fu cried gleefully, completely won\\nover. “It can’t go wrong!”\\n\\nHis jubilation was interrupted by the arrival of the butler\\nKao Sheng, who hurried in and whispered something in Wu\\nSun-fu’s ear. The other two noticed that Wu Sun-fu winced\\nmomentarily. He sprang up, excused himself hastily, and hurried\\nout of the room.\\n\\nWang Ho-fu and Tang Yun-shan remained still for a moment,\\nand the only movement was of the latter’s shiny bald head, and\\nof the smoke of his cigarette, which spiralled upwards from\\nhis lips like bubbles rising to the surface of a pond. Suddenly,\\nhe stubbed out his cigarette and dropped it into the ashtray.\\n\\n“Capital five million dollars, one-third of which cash down,”\\nhe muttered to himself. “That’s a little over one and a half\\nmillion. Hm, you can’t do much with that!”\\n\\nHe glanced at’ Wang Ho-fu, who appeared not to have heard\\nhim, but was quietly relaxing with closed eyes, or perhaps he\\nwas busy with some plan of his own. Tang Yun-shan looked\\nat the plan once more and counted the new projects listed there.\\nThere were at least five of them, including even some heavy\\nindustries. Now, even he, layman as he was, could not believe\\nthat five million dollars was enough to go round, let alone a mere\\nmillion and a half. An exclamation suddenly burst from his\\n\\nlips:\\n\\n“Ah! there’s a great flaw in this! A very great law! We\\nmust definitely go into it with Wu Sun-fu!”\\n\\nStartled, Wang Ho-fu opened his eyes wide, but when he saw\\nYun-shan’s serious expression, he burst out laughing. Tang\\nYun-shan, however, who ordinarily roared with laughter on the\\nslightest pretext was in no laughing mood now.\\n\\n“B—but, Ho-fu!l” he spluttered. “Five million won’t be\\nenough, will it?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu came back into the room just in time to see Tang\\nYun-shan agitatedly pointing at the draft, and to hear him say\\n“Five million won’t be enough, will it?’ He understood in a\\nflash, but for the moment he was too preoccupied with what Tu\\nChu-chai had just told him on the telephone about an unfavour~\\nable development in the stock market to make any comment, so\\nhe just let him rave on.\\n\\nWang Ho-fu, realizing what was the matter, began to explain\\nit to Tang Yun-shan in simple terms:\\n\\n“It’s like this, Yun-shan: we intend to do things step by step,\\nnot start all the enterprises at once—”\\n\\n“Then why should we be applying for a government licence for\\neverything in the plan?” protested Tang Yun-shan with a glance\\nat Wu Sun-fu.\\n\\n“Yes, but taking out a licence first,” explained Wang Ho-fu\\ntestily, becoming impatient of Tang Yun-shan’s naivety, “is just\\nlike making advance bookings at a theatre.”\\n\\n“To tell the truth,” joined in Wu Sun-fu, dropping into a chair,\\n“the first thing we’ll do once the business gets going won’t be to\\nset up new enterprises, but to help out those of the old ones which\\nare a bit shaky. But, all the same, we have to make advance\\nbookings, so to speak, for new enterprises.”\\n\\n“That’s all very well,” retorted Tang Yun-shan, “but what\\nhappens if they don’t want us to help them out? Your million\\nand a half capital will be standing idle!”\\n\\n“Ah, but we\\'ll have a way of making them want to!” Wu\\nSun-fu assured him with a sardonic smile.\\n\\n“Yun-shan, money need never stand still. And how far do you\\nthink a mere million and a half would go if you put it into gov-\\nernment bonds?”\\n\\n“Ho-fu’s right,” corroborated Wu Sun-fu. “Since our com-\\npany is to be essentially a financial scheme, it\\'ll be one of the\\nmain lines of our business to speculate in government bonds.”\\n\\nAll this only made Tang Yun-shan all the more confused. He\\nscratched his bald head and stared at the other two as if he\\nwere apologizing for being such a “greenhorn,” though deep down\\nhe had more than a suspicion that they were deliberately avoid-\\ning the point at issue.\\n\\nThe door opened, and the butler Kao Sheng could be seen out-\\nside standing politely aside to allow a visitor to pass into the\\nroom. It was Sun Chi-jen, beaming all over his face. It was\\nobvious at a glance that he was the bearer of good news. Tang\\nYun-shan’ was the first to notice him.\\n\\n“Ah, Chi-jen!” he cried, jumping up. “You\\'re just in time!\\nI was just getting out of my depth. I herewith relinquish my\\noffice as your locum tenens!”\\n\\nSun Chi-jen gave a start, thinking that something must have\\ngone wrong, but he was reassured when Wu Sun-fu and Wang\\nHo-fu burst out laughing and hurried forward to greet him. They\\nassured him that they had discussed his plan and passed it\\nunanimously, and that they would get going as soon as a date\\nhad been fixed.\\n\\n“Chi-jen, I understood you were otherwise engaged,” Wu Sun-\\nfu said. “I’m glad you managed to get here after all.”\\n\\n“? had an appointment with a friend of mine,” replied Sun\\nChi-jen, sinking into a rocking-chair. “Nothing important, really,\\nbut in the course of our discussion I stumbled on just the sort\\nof thing we want—” His long neck swung round towards Wu\\nSun-fu.\\n\\n“Guess what it is, Sun-fu!” he beamed. “Well, in three days\\nwe can set up our company!”\\n\\nThis was news indeed! Everyone looked overjoyed but no\\none spoke: they just turned and looked expectantly at Sun Chi-jen.\\n\\n“Now you know it takes a long time to get a licence from the\\nMinistry of Finance for a banking company, but we can’t really\\nafford to wait. If we called ourselves a consortium, we could\\ntake out a licence more easily, but our activities would be rather\\nlimited, and we don’t want that. But now I have a solution:\\nThere’s a certain trust company which is willing to co-operate\\n\\nwith us—I say ‘co-operate,’ but actually, of course, we’ll control\\nthe concern. The reason I dashed over was to break the news,\\nso that we could discuss it and decide what to do. If you all\\nthink it would be a good idea, we can work out the terms we\\nshall offer them.”\\n\\nSun Chi-jen spoke slowly and deliberately, but his little head\\nwagged with excitement.\\n\\nAn animated discussion ensued: questions, replies, pondering,\\nand planning. The atmosphere was suddenly charged with ex-\\ncitement and tension. They expected Wu Sun-fu to subscribe\\ntwo hundred thousand dollars within a week, but he felt rather\\nhard put to it to do it, for just lately he had borrowed close on\\na million dollars—from various banks and money-lenders to pay\\nhis share in Chao Po-tao’s “bull company” and on top of that he\\nstill had no idea how much he had lost in the incident in his\\nhome town. Consequently, his financial “manoeuvring power”\\nhad been much reduced. Nevertheless, he made up his mind on\\nit and agreed to Sun Chi-jen’s proposal, which was that within\\na week of the trust company accepting their terms, the three of\\nthem should each pay in two hundred thousand dollars as his\\nshare of the initial capital, so that they could begin operations\\nwithout more ado.\\n\\nThey also decided that their first move would be to make a\\nloan to help out the two industrialists Chu Yin-chiu and Chen\\nChun-yi.\\n\\n“You\\'ll arrange things with the trust company, then, Chi-jen,”\\nsaid Wu Sun-fu with enthusiasm. “I think we’d best leave that\\nside of it entirely to you.” He was quite confident of success,\\nlike a general on the eve of a decisive battle.\\n\\n“Shan’t we try to get any more subscriptions of shares, then?”\\nTang Yun-shan asked hopefully.\\n\\n“No!—” chorused the others firmly.\\n\\nTang Yun-shan forced a smile, though he was inwardly rather\\ndisappointed. It was now quite clear that he would never have\\nthe opportunity of seeing his masterpiece, his great industrial\\nscheme, in the papers. But he quickly swallowed his disappoint-\\nment and soon he was talking and laughing again.\\n\\n*\\n\\nAfter seeing his visitors off at the gate, Wu Sun-fu returned to\\nthe drawing-room and paced confidently up and down for a while.\\nBy now it was ten o’clock and time for him to go to the factory.\\nHe went into his study and wrote out two telegrams, one to the\\ncounty government and one to Fei Little Beard, care of the\\ncounty government. Then he rang for Kao Sheng and gave him\\nhis orders:\\n\\n“Mr. Tu Chu-chai’ll be ringing up later on. Ask him to get\\nin touch with me at the factory. Two telegrams for Li Kuei to\\nsend off at once. And now the car!”\\n\\n“Very good, sir. Are you going to the factory now, sir? There’s\\na Mr. Tu from the factory to see you—he’s been waiting some\\ntime at the lodge. Will you see him now, sir?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu had forgotten that he had sent for Tu Wei-yueh,\\nand this was the second time he had come. The first time he\\nhad waited a whole evening without seeing a sign of Wu Sun-\\nfu, and now he’d come just when he was busy. After a mo-\\nment’s hesitation, Wu Sun-fu said rather impatiently, “Oh, all\\nright; show him in.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu sat down at his desk. He glanced over the staff\\nlist, trying to remember what Tu Wei-yueh looked like, but with-\\nout much success. There were so many petty clerks in the fac-\\ntory that even he, shrewd as he was, could not be expected to\\nremember them all individually. His thoughts wandered to the\\n“pep-talk” he had given the women the day before, and the\\nvarious reports submitted by Mo Kan-cheng. Yes, everything\\nseemed to be going smoothly. All he had to do was to use a\\nlittle more tact, and the storm would probably blow over.\\n\\nHe felt so relieved at the thought that when Tu Wei-yueh came\\ninto the room, his purplish face, usually so stern, was brightened\\nby a ghost of a smile,\\n\\n“So you’re Tu Wei-yueh, are you?” said Wu Sun-fu, leaning\\nforward slightly and darting his keen eyes over the young man.\\nTu Wei-yueh bowed but made no reply. He showed no signs of\\nnervousness, but returned Wu Sun-fu’s glance frankly. As he\\nstood there, erect and dignified, his clear, healthy face was com-\\npletely expressionless and his bright eyes were alert and com-\\nposed.\\n\\n“How long have you been at the factory?”\\n\\n“Two years and ten days,” Tu Wei-yueh answered briefly and\\nquietly. His exactness pleased Wu Sun-fu.\\n\\n“Where do you come from?”\\n\\n“I’ve the honour to be a fellow-townsman of yours.”\\n\\n“Oh ... from Shuangchiao Town, eh? Who vouches for your\\ngood conduct?”\\n\\n“Nobody.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was amazed. He reached out for the staff list for\\nmore information about this young man, when the latter himself\\nexplained:\\n\\n“As you may remember, I came with a letter of recommenda-\\ntion from Old Mr. Wu, your father. You put me in the General\\nOffice as a junior clerk. Since then I’ve never been told that I\\nneed someone to vouch for me.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s face twitched in what could have been a smile. He\\nremembered now: two years ago, his late father had recom-\\nmended this young man as the son of an old friend of his, who\\nalso happened to be a pupil of Wu Sun-fu’s grandfather. Wu Sun-\\nfu, who had never liked his father’s way of life and his old-\\nfashioned outlook, now suddenly looked at Tu Wei-yueh with\\ntransferred disfavour. He scowled and came straight to the point.\\n\\n“It’s been reported to me that it was you who let on about the\\nwage-cut and so caused the sit-down strike the other day.”\\n\\n“That’s right: I told some of the women that a wage-cut was\\ncoming soon.”\\n\\n“You did, did you? Quite the little talebearer, aren’t you?—\\nYou know damn well it’s against the regulations!”\\n\\n“I don’t remember seeing anything of the kind in your Factory\\nRegulations, Mr. Wu,” Tu Wei-yueh replied calmly, gazing com-\\nposedly at Wu Sun-fu’s angry face.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu narrowed his eyes and looked at Tu Wei-yueh, who\\njust stood there with a quiet dignity, his features betraying not\\nthe slightest sign of uneasiness. He was the first employee who\\nhad not quailed before Wu Sun-fu’s basilisk eye. Wu Sun-fu\\ncould not help secretly admiring this cool and courageous young\\nfellow. His face relaxed a little as he said in a milder tone of\\nvoice:\\n\\n“In any case, you shouldn’t have told them. Can’t you see\\nwhat a lot of trouble it’s caused?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I can’t agree with you there. Since there’s going\\nto be a wage-cut, what difference does it make whether the\\nwomen know about it now or later on? Besides, even if you\\nhadn’t decided to cut their wages, they’d have gone on strike\\njust the same. It was bound to happen sooner or later.”\\n\\n“what the devil do you mean by that?”\\n\\n“Just this: the women already know that you’ve got a con-\\ntract for a large quantity of silk and that you\\'re speeding up\\nthe work to meet the order on time. Naturally enough, this is\\nan opportunity for them and they don’t want to miss it.”\\n\\nAt this, Wu Sun-fu’s face became convulsed with rage.\\n\\n“What!” he rasped through clenched teeth. “They know\\nabout my contract? They know even this? I suppose you told\\nthem that, too, did you?”\\n\\n“In a way, yes. They’d heard about it from some other source,\\nand ‘when they came and asked me, I just confirmed it. I couldn’t\\nhave told them a lie. I’m sure you\\'ll agree, Mr. Wu, that a man\\nwho tells lies is the last man to rely upon.”\\n\\nWith a bellow of rage, Wu Sun-fu banged on the table and\\nsprang to his feet.\\n\\n“You scoundrel!” he roared. “You\\'re just toadying to the\\nwomen!”\\n\\nTo this Tu Wei-yueh did not reply, except to bow slightly and\\nsmile his calm smile.\\n\\n“I know you carry on with some girl named Chu. You\\'re\\njust trying to get round her!”\\n\\n“Mr. Wu, please don’t drag my private affairs into it said\\nTu Wei-yueh calmly and defiantly, a glint of resentment in his\\nkeen eyes as he stared Wu Sun-fu in the eye.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s expression had also changed: he now looked firm\\nand cold-blooded, and much more formidable than when he was\\nranting and raving. Tu Wei-yueh could see from all this what\\nwas coming to him, yet he was not in the least perturbed. He\\nwas intelligent, resourceful and courageous, but he was also\\nstubborn. He was not without a certain affection for his job\\ntoo, but he would never stoop to fawning on his employer in\\nthe way Mo Kan-cheng did. He stood there with a faint smile,\\ncalmly awaiting Wu Sun-fu’s final disposal of him.\\n\\nyr\\n\\nAn oppressive silence fell upon the room. Wu Sun-fu stretched\\nout his hand to press the bell on the wall. At a touch of\\nhis finger, Tu Wei-yueh’s fate would be sealed. However, he\\nsuddenly changed his mind, took his hand away, and turned to\\nscan Tu Wei-yueh’s face once more. Alertness, calmness, cour-\\nage: he could see them all in the youngster’s face. A young\\nman like this, if properly handled, could be very useful, he\\nmused, There was no one to touch him on the whole of his\\nstaff. But was he reliable? These days, the more ability, drive\\nand initiative a young man had, the more likely he was to have\\nwild ideas. But that was something he could not tell at first\\nsight. Wu Sun-fu thought hard and long, and when he finally\\nsat down his expression was not so fearsome as it had been a few\\nmoments ago, though his voice was still harsh when he spoke\\nagain:\\n\\n“The way you behave is nothing short of egging the women on\\nto make trouble.”\\n\\n“You ought to realize, Mr. Wu, that that is something nobody\\ncould do!”\\n\\n“You\\'re just an agitator!” Wu Sun-fu raved angrily.\\n\\nNo answer. Tu Wei-yueh merely drew himself up and smiled\\nsardonically.\\n\\n“What are you sneering at?”\\n\\n“Am I sneering? If I sneer, Mr. Wu, it’s because I should\\nhave thought you would at least have realized that everyone\\nmust live and that everyone wants a decent standard of living.\\nThat fact alone is the most powerful incentive to agitation.”\\n\\n“Tst! Nonsense! The women have more sense than you.\\nThey realize that there are other points of view to be considered\\nbesides their own. They realize that capital and labour must\\nwork together. Didn’t you see the way they quietened down when\\nI explained things to them yesterday? And don’t the trade\\nunion people support me, and aren’t they doing their best to\\nfind a solution? Oh, yes, I know there are some dangerous\\nelements among the women, inciting them to make trouble.\\nThey pretend to have the women’s interests at heart, but all the\\ntime they’re trying to take the bread out of their mouths by\\nlosing them their jobs. I’m in possession of detailed information\\nabout them and I know these dangerous elements are just the\\n\\ndupes of someone outside who\\'s just leading them up the garden\\npath. I’m for peace, myself, and I don’t like the idea of enforc-\\ning high-handed measures; but as the owner of the factory I’m\\nlike the head of a family, and as such I can’t allow any black\\nsheep among my employees. I’ll have to expose the evil inten-\\ntions of the trouble-makers, so that the women may know them\\nfor what they are, and fight them themselves from within!—”\\n\\n“Mr, Wu, was it just to tell me all this that you summoned me\\nhere twice?” Tu Wei-yueh asked disdainfully, his face still not\\nbetraying a flicker of emotion, as soon as Wu Sun-fu paused for\\nbreath.\\n\\n“Fh? What else were you expecting?”\\n\\n“Nothing. But I should have thought that you might have had\\nsomething else to say.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu stared at the young man in astonishment and was\\nbeginning to wonder whether he had not a madman to deal with.\\n\\n“Get out!” he suddenly stormed. “And leave your badge here!”\\n\\nSlowly and calmly, Tu Wei-yueh took out his employee’s badge\\nand laid it on the table. He smiled, bowed slightly, and turned\\nto go, when Wu Sun-fu suddenly called him back.\\n\\n“Just a minute! If you\\'ll just come down to the factory with\\nme, you\\'ll be able to see for yourself how quiet everything is\\nnow and how game the women are to consider the interests of\\nthe factory as a whole!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh turned and looked Wu Sun-fu in the eye. The\\nsmile had never left.his face, and Wu Sun-fu could see now that\\nit was not the smile of a madman at all.\\n\\n“What are you smiling at?”\\n\\n“I\\'m smiling... at the thought that it’s usually calm before\\na storm—so calm that there isn’t even a breath of wind!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s face suddenly purpled, but he immediately pulled\\nhimself together. His experienced eye had at last discovered\\nsomething unique in Tu Wei-yueh’s attitude, something which\\ntold him that this young fellow was decidedly not mad, but\\nsomething quite out of the ordinary. Wu Sun-fu asked as polite-\\nly as he could:\\n\\n“Do you mean to say the information I’ve had from Mo Kan-\\ncheng is incorrect? Do you mean to say that the trade union\\npeople will side with the women to fight against me?”\\n\\n“I’ve no idea what Mo Kan-cheng’s told you. No, I don’t think\\nthe trade union people would turn against you. But surely you\\nmust know how little use they really are to you?”\\n\\n“Eh? Do you mean—?”\\n\\n“These union people may be rather important in your eyes,\\nbut the women don’t care a damn for them.”\\n\\n“You mean they’re useless?”\\n\\n“It’s not quite as simple as that. If the women had confidence\\nin them, they’d naturally be very useful; but as they seem to\\nbe on your side, the women don’t trust them. This so-called\\ntrade union’s nothing more than a figure-head—no, I don’t think\\nyou could even call it that any longer, for even a mere figure-\\nhead, as you’re probably well aware, has its uses as a stimulant,\\nand our trade union hasn’t even that much usefulness. Now\\nthat the unrest among the women is getting really serious, the\\nunion has been shown up for the empty bubble that it is. They\\nwant to do as you tell them and at the same time keep up the\\npretence of representing the interests of the women. I suppose\\nI’d better be frank with you: the union leaders want to come to\\na secret understanding with you, while at the same time they\\nstill put on an act with the women of protecting their interests.”\\n\\n“What do you mean, ‘understanding’?”\\n\\n“They want a five per cent rise in the monthly bonus and a\\nspecial two-dollar bonus for the Dragon-boat Festival.”\\n\\n“What! A bigger bonus and one at the festival as well?”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s the idea they’re putting into the women’s heads.\\nThey hope such a concession will stave off the women’s demand\\nfor a cost-of-living allowance. If they can’t even do this for\\nthem, their bubble will be pricked. Since they run the union,\\nit’s inevitable that they should try to play this sort of trick.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s face became distorted with rage.\\n\\n“So that’s their game, is it?” he snarled. “How is it that Mo\\nKan-cheng hasn’t told me anything about it? Has he fallen\\nasleep on the job?”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled cynically.\\n\\nAfter a moment Wu Sun-fu calmed down and eyed Tu Wei-\\nyueh narrowly.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you come and tell me all this earlier?” he\\ndemanded abruptly.\\n\\n“You didn\\'t ask me earlier, Mr. Wu,” replied Tu Wei-yueh\\ndryly, a self-satisfied glint in his eye. “Anyway, I shouldn\\'t\\nhave thought a mere clerk doing odd jobs in the office and earn-\\ning twenty dollars a month would be expected to send in reports\\nof this kind. But things are different now that you’ve taken\\nback my employee’s badge: now I am just the son of your\\nfather’s friend. We\\'re just two friends chatting about this and\\nthat—the union, conditions in the factory, and so on. I don’t\\nmind discussing these things now that there’s no danger of\\narousing jealcusy or being accused of crawling or stabbing\\nanyone in the back.”\\n\\nFeeling the sting in Tu Wei-yueh’s remarks, Wu Sun-fu forced\\na smile; he couldn’t help admiring this formidable young man.\\nHe couldn’t understand how it was that he had failed to notice\\nhim before when he had been at the factory for two years.\\n\\n“You appear to be a young man of strong will,” he said tenta-\\ntively.\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Wu,” smiled Tu Wei-yueh. “Except for my will-\\npower, there’s nothing else I’ve got that I can take a pride in.”\\n\\nThe insinuation in his reply seemed quite lost on Wu Sun-\\nfu, who bent his head in thought for a moment, then suddenly\\nburst out:\\n\\n“So they want an increased bonus and a special bonus into\\nthe bargain, do they? I just can’t agree to that. Can you see\\nany way of putting an end to the trouble without giving in to\\nthem?”\\n\\n“You can refuse if you like, but if you do the trouble will end\\nin quite another way.”\\n\\n“you think the women would dare to riot?”\\n\\n“That depends on how you go about it, Mr. Wu.”\\n\\n“The way you look at it, I must give them something, then\\n—isn’t that so? All right, then: I may as well help the union\\npeople to play their trick.”\\n\\n“you can do it that way if you like.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was none too pleased at this reply. He glanced\\nquickly at the smiling face of Tu Wei-yueh.\\n\\n“What else can you suggest?”\\n\\n“Just work it out, Mr. Wu: how much would it cost you,\\nif you did what the union people want you to do?”\\n\\n“About five thousand dollars, I suppose.”\\n\\n“Right,” continued Tu Wei-yueh calmly. “Five thousand dol-\\nlars is not what you\\'d call a large sum of money. But perhaps\\na smaller sum than five thousand could produce even greater\\nresults, if only you can find someone who knows how to make\\ngood use of it.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s thick eyebrows seemed to twitch, but his face be-\\ntrayed not a flicker of emotion. His keen eyes gradually fas-\\ntened themselves upon Tu Wei-yueh’s face in a penetrating gaze\\nthat seemed to go right through him, so that even Tu Wei-yueh,\\nfor all his coolness, felt rather ill at ease. He dropped his head\\nand bit his lip.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu suddenly stood up and boomed, “Do you know what\\nthe women are up to now?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t. I expect you\\'ll find out when you get to the\\nfactory,” countered Tu Wei-yueh, looking the other in the face\\nand drawing himself up to his full height. Wu Sun-fu could not\\nhelp laughing good-humouredly. He realized that once this\\nyoung man had made up his mind not to give anything away,\\nthere was nothing he could do to make him. His obstinacy\\nannoyed him rather, but he admired his firmness, and had now\\nmade up his mind to enlist the young man as an ally. He picked\\nup a pen and, without sitting down, scribbled a few lines on a\\nsheet of note paper and gave it to Tu Wei-yueh.\\n\\n“I took your badge away just now,” he said with a gracious\\nsmile, “and now I’m giving you this in exchange.”\\n\\nThe note said briefly: “To Mr. Mo Kan-cheng. This is to\\ninform you that as from this month Mr. Tu Wei-yueh’s salary\\nwill be increased by fifty dollars. Wu Sun-fu, May 19.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh glanced over the note and laid it on the table.\\nHe said nothing, and his face was as expressionless as before.\\n\\n“What!” gasped Wu Sun-fu, staring at Tu Wei-yueh in amaze-\\nment. “Don’t you want to work for me?”\\n\\n“Thank you very much for your kindness, Mr. Wu, but I\\ncouldn’t accept it. This piece of paper won’t enable me to do\\nanything worth while.”\\n\\nFor the first time Tu Wei-yueh betrayed some emotion in his\\nvoice, as he frankly returned Wu Sun-fu’s gaze.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu did not say anything, but quietly pressed the bell\\non the wall; then, picking up his pen again, he added a few\\nwords to the note: “All inspectors and forewomen below Mo\\nKan-cheng will take orders from Tu Wei-yueh as from today.\\nDisobedience will not be tolerated.” He threw down the pen and\\nturned to the butler who had just come into the room. “Send\\nthe car round to take Mr. Tu here to the factory.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh read the postscript, looked at Wu Sun-fu intently\\nfor a moment, then bowed: “As from today, I have the privilege\\nof serving you, Mr. Wu.”\\n\\n“If a man’s got ability, I\\'ll always give him a fair chance. I’m\\nwell aware that there are a lot of very able young men about\\nthese days, but unfortunately I’m always too busy to be able to\\nspend much time getting around among the younger people.—\\nAnd now you can go back to the factory and tell the women\\nthat I\\'l do my best to give them satisfaction. — And if you want\\nto see me about anything, just drop in any time.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s face beamed with satisfaction, for his keen powers\\nof observation and appraisal told him that the trouble in the\\nfactory would soon be over.\\n\\n*\\n\\n_ However, a man like Wu Sun-fu could not be content with\\na single achievement. He began pacing the floor, sunk in\\nthought. Suddenly a doubt began to trouble him: was he such a\\ngood judge of men after all? Though he had always kept his\\neyes open for capable men, he had overlooked this Tu Wei-yueh\\nuntil this moment. Another thing: he had not been able to\\nanticipate this trouble in the factory, and right up till yesterday\\nhe still had no accurate idea of how strong the women really\\nwere. As a matter of fact, he had been blinded and deceived\\nby his own underlings, and even found himself under the menace\\nof his unruly workers. Now, even though he had high hopes\\nof finding a solution to the immediate problem—and a solution\\nwhich was to his advantage—nevertheless it had cost him a\\npretty penny. Taking things all in all, it had been a serious\\nsetback for him.\\n\\nIt was not that he grudged spending an extra two or three\\nthousand dollars—he sometimes lost more than that in a few\\ngames of mahjong, and gladly—but to have to pay out because\\n\\nof his subordinates’ inefficiency was a different matter and he\\nwould have to put a stop to it. Foreign businessmen, he mused,\\nwere naturally more far-sighted and they knew how to manage\\nthings with a rod of iron, but then they had loyal and competent\\nstaff. It was this last that lay behind their ability to deal with\\ndifficult situations easily and make a success of everything they\\ndid. In industrially backward China, on the other hand, there\\nwas no such force of trained staff available. The office staff\\nhe had in his factory were no better than a lot of hangers-on\\nsponging on a local squire: all they were fit for was dodging\\ntheir work, fawning on him, and making a mess of everything.\\nAs these thoughts passed through his mind, Wu Sun-fu suddenly\\nlost hope in the future of China’s youthful industry. There was\\nnot even a reserve of staff to fill the lower administrative grades,\\nto say nothing of the higher grades.\\n\\nPeople like Mo Kan-cheng, for instance, were not fit to be\\nanything more than rent and debt collectors in a country town.\\nThe forewoman Wang Chin-chen and the overseer Li the Pock-\\nmarked were a couple of scoundrels whose only abilities were\\nbluffing, bickering, beating the women, and taking his bribes.\\nFor all that, he had not got rid of them because it was so diffi-\\ncult to find competent, reliable staff. Besides, with his own\\neagle eye watching over things all the time, there should never\\nhave been any trouble. How was he to know that he was on\\nthe verge of disaster? It must be that the women are not so\\ntractable as used to be!\\n\\nThe more Wu Sun-fu pondered as he paced to and fro, the\\nmore depressed he became. He had always believed in hiding\\nhis fits of depression from other people, even from his wife. It\\nwas this custom that had enabled him to win the trust and re-\\nspect of other people, and he also regarded it as the best method\\nof self-discipline. But there was one disadvantage: whenever\\nhe locked himself up and fretted and brooded alone, he was al-\\nways acutely aware of his loneliness. He felt like a commander-\\nin-chief racking his brains without a trusted aide-de-camp to\\nconfide in or an able staff-officer to advise him. Just a short\\nwhile ago he had taken a liking to Tu Wei-yueh and promoted\\nhim on the spot to a position of great responsibility; but he was\\nsuddenly assailed by doubts—not about the young man’s talents,\\n\\nabout which he had no qualms, but about his ideas. Nowadays,\\nhe believed, the more intelligent, capable and spirited a young\\nman was, the more dangerous were his ideas, and the more\\nlikely he was to be possessed by the “evil creed” of communism.\\n\\nThis worry nagged at Wu Sun-fu until he was on the verge of\\ndespair. Middle-aged men like Mo Kan-cheng were useless and\\nyoung men like Tu Wei-yueh were dangerous. Yet how could\\nhe keep the wheels of industry turning on his own? He scowled\\nwith frustration and clenched his teeth, then picked up the tele-\\nphone and barked into it: he had decided to tell Mo Kan-cheng\\nto keep an unobtrusive eye on Tu Wei-yueh.\\n\\nBut when he heard Mo Kan-cheng humming and hawing like\\nan imbecile at the other end of the line, Wu Sun-fu suddenly\\nchanged his mind and rasped sternly at him instead:\\n\\n“Have you received my note?... Right! All the staff will\\nobey Mr. Tu’s orders—and no shirking!... Money? Well,\\nhe’ll want some for—um, ‘expenses’. . . . Let him have what\\n\\nhe wants, and he can account to me personally. Understand?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu put down the receiver and smiled grimly. Now\\nthat he had taken the plunge and put Tu Wei-yueh on trial, he\\nwould have to keep an eye on this likable yet alarming young\\nman himself. And he had to show himself consistent and firm\\nof purpose and not let his employees know that he could some-\\ntimes waver—that he had put a man in a job and yet hesitated\\nto trust him.\\n\\nHe left the library in a hurry and walked along the veranda\\nto the drawing-room.\\n\\nHis bulletproof motorcar was waiting for him in front of the\\nsteps outside the drawing-room, and his chauffeur and Old Kuan,\\nhis bodyguard, were chatting idly.\\n\\nThe door of the small drawing-room was ajar and Wu Sun-fu\\nheard sounds of gay youthful laughter coming from inside. He\\nfrowned and automatically glanced to see his wife, Lin Pei-shan,\\nand Fan Po-wen with their heads together. He had seldom\\npaid attention to them, but this time he felt suddenly annoyed.\\nCoughing tactfully, he stepped into the room with an expression\\nof displeasure on his face.\\n\\nSurprised, the three of them started apart to reveal a fourth,\\nAh-hsuan, who had been hidden between Mrs. Wu Sun-fu and\\n\\nFan Po-wen. The boy was still engrossed in some book or other\\nquite unaware of Wu Sun-fu’s presence. The latter walked up\\nto them, glaring round the room and finally stopping to fix his\\ngaze on Ah-hsuan.\\n\\nAh-hsuan suddenly came to and looked quickly up and, seeing\\nwho it was, self-consciously put the book down. Lin Pei-shan\\nhad gone over and sat down by the window and was tittering\\nbehind her hand. Wu Sun-fu had only intended to assert his\\nauthority, but he was becoming really annoyed. He restrained\\nhimself, however, and casually picked up the book and glanced\\nat it: it was a collection of Fan Po-wen’s verses.\\n\\n“Modern poetry, eh? You youngsters are very fond of that\\nsort of thing, aren’t you!”\\n\\nHis tone and smile conveyed a hint of sarcasm. He glanced\\nat Fan Po-wen, and began idly turning the pages. When a poem\\ncaught his eye:\\n\\nGone are the lovely banks of the Su\\n\\nWhose winding way was edged with tender green,\\nUsurped by motorcars like beetles black\\nEnveloped in a swirl of yellow dust;\\n\\nAnd the vulgar villas of the idle rich\\n\\nHave sullied the quiet grace of West Lake.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu broke into a contemptuous laugh. He suddenly re-\\nmembered that Fan Po-wen had often accused the “vulgar bour-\\ngeoisie”’ of not understanding that sublime and sacred subject—\\nArt. This view of Fan Po-wen, which he had thought merely\\nridiculous before, was now offensive to him. Modern youth were\\njust like that: either romantic and decadent, or radical and per-\\nverted. As he looked at the poet Fan Po-wen standing before\\nhim, his mind flashed to Tu Wei-yueh who had just left him.\\nSince he could not very well give the poet a lecture he turned\\nto take it out on his younger brother.\\n\\n“Well, well, Ah-hsuan! You’ve only been in Shanghai a few\\ndays, and you’ve already become a man of culture! Unfortunate-\\nly, only a talented man can be a poet, and one could hardly\\neall you talented!”\\n\\n“But there’s a famous saying that a poet can be either a genius\\nor an idiot,” put in Fan Po-wen sarcastically, with a knowing\\n\\nwink at Lin Pei-shan. “In Ah-hsuan one can catch a glimpse of\\nthe poet. Anyway, he’s much more hopeful than Mammon sit-\\nting in his golden palace.” This witticism made Lin Pei-shan\\ngiggle uncontrollably and even Mrs. Wu Sun-fu couldn’t help\\nsmiling. Wu Sun-fu and Ah-hsuan, however, remained serious;\\nthen Ah-hsuan looked up quickly in bewilderment to see that\\nWu Sun-fu was frowning. Though not a “poet” himself, Wu\\nSun-fu understood quite well what Fan Po-wen meant. He\\ndetested people who showed off their cleverness in glib phrases,\\nand believed that only a nincompoop could indulge in such petty\\ntricks of speech just to get a laugh from the ladies. He glared\\nbriefly at Fan Po-wen and turned to go, when the latter said:\\n\\n“I say, Sun-fu, I really don’t understand why you have to stay\\nin the silk business. There are lots of other ways of making\\nmoney, you know.”\\n\\n“Silk’s the only Chinese industry that can win back some of\\nthe money that’s going out of the country,” replied Wu Sun-fu,\\nas if he grudged an answer; his dislike of the poet was more in-\\ntense than ever.\\n\\n“Oh, is it? Chinese silk goes abroad, is made into silk goods,\\nand then sold back to China. Look at Pei-yao and Pei-shan—\\nthey’re wearing Chinese silk from abroad! Last month I hap-\\npened to be in Hangchow and I noticed that on nine looms out\\nof ten they were using Japanese rayon. This year alone Shang-\\nhai merchants have imported over eighteen thousand bales of\\nJapanese rayon at a cost of some nine million eight hundred\\nthousand dollars! At present the export of Chinese silk to\\nEurope is at a standstill, and the New York market is flooded\\nwith Japanese silk, while Chinese silk is just piling up in the\\nmanufacturers’ warehouses. And while you are bemoaning the\\nfact that there is no market for your silk, Chinese silk goods\\nmanufacturers are importing Japanese rayon. Isn’t that a curious\\nphenomenon and a handicap to Chinese industry?”\\n\\nFan Po-wen delivered himself of this oration as if he was\\nanxious to free himself of the stigma of “romantic poet,” but\\nfor all that, Wu Sun-fu’s dislike of the poet was in no way les-\\nsened; in fact, it made him dislike him all the more. As an\\nindustrialist, he was not interested in such superficial views\\non the bad luck of Chinese silk. The chief mission of an in-\\n\\ndustrialist, as he saw it, was to develop industry, to increase\\nthe number of factory chimneys, and to expand the market.\\nIf his silk went through a factory in a foreign country and came\\nback to China in modified form, that was not his concern, It\\nwas the job of the government to take care of that. An in-\\ndustrialist could not cut off his nose to spite his face!\\n\\n“Ha! the same old platitudes!” snorted Wu Sun-fu cynically,\\nas he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. In the doorway he\\nturned his head to call his wife into the dining-room, where he\\nwarned her sternly:\\n\\n“Pei-yao, I think you should keep an eye on your sister, and\\nnot let her fritter away her time as if she were still a child.”\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu stared at her husband, not knowing what\\nto make of it.\\n\\n“Po-wen,” he went on, “may be intelligent and witty, but\\nhe’s got no ‘go’ in him. I don’t like to see Pei-shan going round\\nwith him all the time. Fu-fang’s told me that she would like\\nto make a match between her and Tu Hsueh-shih. So far as\\nI can see, Hsueh-shih’s the more promising of the two.”\\n\\n“Oh... I see,” his wife answered hesitatingly after a long\\npause, still staring at him. “Don’t you think we’d better leave\\nher to make her own choice?”\\n\\nShe did not like Fan Po-wen particularly—-she lately changed\\nher mind about him—nor did she think highly of Tu Hsueh-shih.\\nShe had a plan of her own for her sister.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu frowned irritatedly, but said no more. With a\\nglance at his wife, who stood there deep in thought, he slipped\\nout into the garden, got into his car, and snapped at his\\nchauffeur:\\n\\n“The club!”\\nVI\\n\\nFAN Po-wen and Lin Pei-shan were sitting together on a red\\nbench in a shady, secluded corner of Jessfield Park. They had\\nbeen there for half an hour.\\n\\nFan Po-wen had Lin Pei-shan’s handbag in his hands and\\nwas toying with it, with that debonair and carefree expression\\non his face which a poet must have. His head on one side, he\\nwas listening with rapt attention while she murmured softly\\nand desultorily, her voice rising and falling. Though they were\\nsheltered by a clump of cypresses from the gaze of passers-by\\nand from the slanting rays of the setting sun, Fan Po-wen felt\\ntiny beads of perspiration breaking out on his temples—but\\nwhether it was because there was no breeze or for some other\\nreason it was hard to tell.\\n\\nLin Pei-shan was wearing a thin, light-blue frock, low-cut and\\nsleeveless. She was sixteen and just at the age when her devel-\\noping figure had reached a plump perfection. Her rounded\\nbreasts seemed to be bursting out of the close confines of her\\nlace-edged white silk slip. As she talked she traced lines on\\nthe grass with the point of her shoe. She was lively yet dis-\\npassionate, as if she was not telling him about herself at all,\\nbut about someone else who did not concern her.\\n\\nHer voice gradually tailed off and soon she stopped altogether;\\nthen, with a sparkling smile, she tilted back her head to gaze\\nat the reddening clouds overhead.\\n\\n“Go on, Pei-shan!” urged Fan Po-wen, turning suddenly to-\\nwards her after sharing her contemplation of the sky for a while.\\n“you’re keeping me in suspense, you know.” Once more he\\nwiped his perspiring brow, then fixed his eyes a little nervously\\non her pretty face.\\n\\nLin Pei-shan returned his look, but without the least sign of\\nnervousness or excitement—just a languid smile. Then, sud-\\ndenly, she giggled and made a gesture as much as to say “That’s\\nall.”\\n\\n“There’s nothing more to tell,” she said in her clear, tinkling\\nvoice. “I’ve told you everything. Aren’t you satisfied?”\\n\\n“I’ve heard enough, but not understood enough,” Fan Po-wen\\nflashed back. Lin Pei-shan giggled and stretched herself, letting\\none arm flash past Fan Po-wen’s face as she did so. The breath\\nof fragrance from her arm so unnerved him that he completely\\nforgot what he had been going to say. He could only gaze, in-\\nfatuated, at her round bright eyes beneath slender eyebrows, her\\ngleaming white teeth between scarlet, slightly parted lips, her\\nsmooth white neck and her swelling breast; and as he gazed, all\\nsorts of vague, confused thoughts chased each other through his\\nbrain. When his eyes went up again to her face, he found her\\nas calm, dispassionate and impersonal as she always was. Her\\nsmile was tender, but apparently without any special significance.\\nFan Po-wen felt something nagging at his mind and suddenly\\nremembered what it was he was going to say:\\n\\n“T really can’t understand why Sun-fu doesn’t agree that you\\nand I—”\\n\\n“That’s Sun-fu’s affair,” she broke in before he could finish.\\n“There’s no point in going over it again!” Neither her face nor\\nher voice betrayed any unusual excitement or annoyance.\\n\\nFan Po-wen was taken aback at her reply: her indifference\\npuzzled him. He waited a moment, then, as she seemed to\\nconsider the subject closed, he tried another approach:\\n\\n“And there’s something else which I don’t understand—why is\\nit that your sister disagrees, too?”\\n\\n“I’ve no idea. I just told you what she told me. What’s the\\npoint of bothering our heads about it?”\\n\\nShe sounded so detached and impersonal that he began to feel\\nexasperated. With an effort, he resisted the temptation to scin-\\ntillate, and said simply:\\n\\n“Don’t be so silly, Pei-shan! Surely you don’t just go around\\nrepeating like a parrot what your sister says? Why don’t you\\ntry to think for yourself? You speak as if your own feelings\\nweren\\'t involved: it is as if you had become completely detached\\n\\nfrom yourself and were looking at yourself from a distance. —\\nPei-shan, you ought to be yourself. Haven’t you any ideas of\\nyour own? Do try to find yourself!”\\n\\n“But I’m here, sitting beside you. It’s me that’s been talking\\nwith you all this time!—-If there is another me, I’ve never\\nknown it, and I don’t want to know, either. My sister told me\\ncertain things in confidence and asked me to keep them to my-\\nself, but since you kept asking me and since some of the things\\nshe said concern you, I just repeated what she said to me. But\\nnow you want to know what my own ideas about it are—well,\\nas a matter of fact, I never have any definite ideas about any-\\nthing. I always feel there’s good and bad to everything, and\\nI’ye never really worried what anyone thinks of anything. —\\nWell, are you still not satisfied?—Oh, it’s really difficult to know\\nwhat else to say!”\\n\\nHer voice was soft and tender and she smiled, as she spoke\\nwhich made Fan Po-wen feel a little better, in a way. But he\\nwas conscious that she had said a great deal without touching\\nthe crucial point—her real attitude towards him.\\n\\nHe drew a sigh and rested his chin dejectedly on his upturned\\npalm, while his eyes strayed from the grass beneath his feet\\nto her shapely calves. On a sudden impulse, he snapped open\\nher handbag and looked in the little oval mirror inside the flap.\\nHe saw a face which was neither too round nor too pointed, a\\nfine-looking intellectual face, rather triangular. It was a little\\npale at the moment, but the pallor was tinged with a sadness\\nthat would appeal to any sensitive young girl. The mirror\\ntrembled, and the reflection suddenly disintegrated and became\\nall eyebrows and eyes—long thick eyebrows matched by. long,\\nintelligent eyes. When the eyes and the eyebrows were viewed\\nas a whole, however, a restless melancholy could be discerned\\nbehind the expression of intelligent awareness. In short, it was\\na face to win the love and sympathy of a sentimental girl of,\\nsay, twenty. If it chanced to attract a girl of sixteen like Lin\\nPei-shan — lively, innocent, and free from worldly cares — it was\\nsimply because of its well-shaped lips, always parted in a\\nmysterious smile and always ready with an amusing quip. After\\ngazing in the mirror awhile, he sighed and snapped the handbag\\nshut. When he looked up at her again, he found a tender\\n\\nsmile still playing round her lips, and when he looked into her\\nlimpid eyes, he seemed to see all the little confidences and\\nintimacies he had ever shared with her reflected there. Could\\nall this be swept away by Wu Sun-fu’s or his wife’s “dis-\\napproval,” then? Never! He was suddenly filled with an excite-\\nment and a boldness such as he had never known before.\\n\\n“Pei-shan! Oh, oh, Pei-shan!” he cried, suddenly grasping\\nher hand.\\n\\nInterpreting this cri du coeur as just another of his customary\\nendearments, she neither moved nor spoke, but merely glanced\\nat him in reply. She had a far-away look in her eyes, and was\\nclearly thinking of something else, something far removed from\\nthe present scene. But Fan Po-wen had no inkling of this. Her\\nhand seemed warmer and softer than ever before, and the mere\\ntouch of it set him a-tingle. Although it was quite commonplace\\nfor them to hold hands, at this moment it held a strange attrac-\\ntion for him. He moved his head closer, intending to steal a\\nkiss, but as he was almost touching her cheek, his courage sud-\\ndenly failed him: he was afraid of being snubbed. He covered\\nhis embarrassment by repeating lamely:\\n\\n“But why should Pei-yao now object to it?”\\n\\n“Oh, dear! Didn’t I just tell you I don’t know?”\\n\\nHer reply came quickly, as if she was surprised at the question.\\nThen she smiled again. Her reply was tempered with a certain\\nwarmth, which he took to imply: “It’s entirely up to you. To\\nme, it’s all the same.” His heart gave a leap and his face flushed\\nhotly. He looked at her with desire in his eyes, from her face\\ndown to her breasts and from her breasts back up to her face:\\nEverything radiated a youthful charm and an irresistible warmth\\nand softness. A sudden idea flashed into his bewildered mind:\\njust a little firmness on his part, and she would yield, wouldn’t\\nshe? He was about to put his idea into action, when he. was\\nstartled by a rustle in the clump of cypresses behind them. He\\nstarted nervously, and his boldness suddenly evaporated.\\n\\nA cool breeze sprang up, and birds were twittering in the\\ntrees opposite. A flock of pigeons fluttered down on to the grass\\nin front of them and began strutting about, stopping now and\\nthen to cock their heads on one side and look at the young\\ncouple. Fan Po-wen shifted his attention to the pigeons. There\\n\\nwas something of the poet about their deportment, and he was\\ntempted to write a short poem about it.\\n\\nLin Pei-shan, who seemed to be deep in thought all this time,\\nsuddenly gave a strange little laugh, as if to herself, and gently\\nwithdrew her hand from his. “I want to go back now,” she\\nsuggested as she stood up. “I’ve been sitting on this hard bench\\nso long that I’m stiff all over.”\\n\\nHis poetic mood was immediately extinguished. He stood up\\nand looked at her in bewilderment, wondering why she was\\nin such a hurry. Though sitting in the park had not contributed\\nmaterially to the solution of his problem — twice he had made\\nup his mind to take the plunge and each time his courage had\\nfailed him — yet how poetic it had been, just the two of them\\nquietly sitting there alone! He would have preferred to stay\\nthere, but he did not want to disagree with her (he had always\\ndone as she suggested), so he just heaved a disgruntled sigh.\\n\\nIn the ordinary way, his gentle passive resistance would have\\nmade her say something which he could have used to bring\\nabout a favourable turn in the situation. But today she was\\nnot her usual self: she just took her handbag from him and\\ndeclared icily:\\n\\n“T really do want to go home! I’m just fed up with every-\\nthing here!” Without waiting for his reply, or even asking him\\nto accompany her, she turned on her heel and walked briskly\\ntowards the park gate. In a few seconds she was out of sight\\namong the trees. He went after her a short way and looked\\nall round, but there was no sign of her.\\n\\n*\\n\\nHe stood in frustration for a few moments, not knowing what\\nto do for the best. At first he thought of running straight to\\nthe park gate and waiting for her there. But his masculine\\npride — the wounded pride of a young man when snubbed by a\\ngirl with whom he had been on good terms—stopped him.\\n\\nFan Po-wen walked disconsolately on through the park, look-\\ning as if he had lost something. The sun was sinking fast and\\ncouples began streaming into the park. They brushed past him,\\nchattering and laughing, and seemed to be sneering at him and\\ngiving him suspicious glances. He envied and hated them at\\nthe same time, especially the men, who looked just like the rich,\\npotbellied businessmen that he so despised. He felt quite out of\\nplace in such self-confident, arrogant company.\\n\\nNow, should he go back to Wu Sun-fu’s place and dally with\\nher again? No, he thought, no self-respecting man would do\\nthat! What about going back to his room in the Tai Lai Hotel,\\nthen? No, that was the last thing he wanted to do. Suddenly\\nthis carefree poet wished he had a home to go to--a home with\\nparents and brothers and sisters; but he had none. He felt\\nhe must be the loneliest man in the world. Then, true to the\\ntime-honoured tradition among depressed poets, an idea began\\nto form in his mind: death. He paced along with bent head,\\nhis fertile imagination toying with the idea of dying. To think\\nof him, a young poet with a carefree air which would make any\\ngirl’s heart flutter, suddenly dying in front of all the members\\nof the fair sex who were gracing the park on this lovely May\\nevening! What a shock that would be for them! Would it not\\nbring every female in the park, all the shy, soulful, sentimental\\nyoung girls, to weep tears of sympathy over his handsome dead\\nbody—or, at least, make their dear hearts beat faster? Would\\nthat not be the most fitting, the most poetic death a poet could\\ndie? He could imagine no better way of turning his sorrow\\ninto happiness and his defeat into victory!\\n\\nAs luck would have it, a conveniently placed pond lay just\\nahead. This was as good a place as any, for all the young couples\\nwould stop when they reached this point, to sit on the benches\\nround the pond. “I’ll do what the great poet Chu Yuan* did!”\\nhe thought, as he made quickly for the pond; but, to his dis-\\nappointment, there were hardly any suitable girls on the benches\\nto witness the tragedy. Several foreign children were sailing a\\ntoy boat on the pond. A girl in white and a boy in grey were\\nlaunching a handsome two-foot yacht. Its three red silk sails\\nbellied out in the wind as the yacht sailed majestically away,\\nleaving a faint trail of white in its wake, while the children\\nran along the bank beside it, whooping and laughing.\\n\\n* A great Chinese poet (340-278 B.C.). Exiled because of his patriot-\\nism and fearless criticism of the collaborationists, he finally drowned\\nhimself.\\n\\nFan Po-wen’s poetic mood suddenly returned, and he soon had\\na couple of decent lines of poetry. All thought of suicide vanished\\nfrom his mind as he decided that the poem was well worth\\nfinishing, but before he could work out the third line, the wind\\nveered and a sudden gust made the little yacht heel over and\\ncapsize,\\n\\nTo. tell the truth, Fan Po-wen was even more dismayed and\\nupset at this unexpected disaster than the children themselves.\\nOn the voyage of life, he thought, one is often caught in such\\nsqualls, squalls which can capsize one’s little boat. Man, poor\\ncreature, is nothing more than the sport of the inscrutable wind\\nof fortune. Again he steeled himself, stepped back with a flour-\\nish, and tensed himself for a plunge into the pond. But just then\\nhe -was seized by a sudden doubt, a doubt miraculously rein-\\nforced by the sound of a voice calling him from behind.\\n\\nHe straightened up and looked round to find Wu Chih-sheng\\nstanding just behind him and smiling at him.\\n\\nHardly knowing why, Fan Po-wen blushed, and stole a glance\\nat Wu Chih-sheng’s face and was relieved to see that his friend\\nhad apparently not realized his intention. He smiled as naturally\\nas he could as he went across to greet him.\\n\\n“On your own?” said Wu Chih-sheng. “Just watching children\\nplaying, eh?”\\n\\nWas there just a hint of suspicion in his voice? Whatever it\\nwas, there was something odd in the way he said this.\\n\\nFan Po-wen gave a silent and evasive nod, but Wu Chih-\\nsheng pressed him further, “Really alone?”\\n\\nFan Po-wen again nodded and fcrced an uneasy smile. He\\nwanted to escape, but decided after all that Wu Chih-sheng’s\\ncompany was perhaps preferable to roaming up and down alone.\\nHe only hoped his friend would talk about something else. As\\nif in answer to his prayer, Wu Chih-sheng immediately changed\\nthe subject.\\n\\n“Have you heard about Chang Su-su? I thought you told me\\nthe other day that she was often brimming over with poetic\\nsentiments —”\\n\\n“Why? what’s the matter with her now? Down with the\\nplague?”\\n\\n“No, she’s not the type to be infected so easily! No, the trouble\\nis, she can’t get on with Li Yu-ting. The professor doesn’t\\nmeasure up to her expectations and she’s quite down in the\\nmouth about it.”\\n\\nAt this news Fan Po-wen laughed gleefully. He felt grateful\\nto Wu Chih-sheng for telling him, and became his usual face-\\ntious self again.\\n\\n“But of course!” he said. “It was as inevitable as one and\\none making two! How could a girl like Su-su, who craves for\\n‘strong stimulation,’ ever be satisfied with a dry-as-dust pro-\\nfessor? But I’m surprised at her, of all people, letting it get her\\ndown! It isn’t worthy of her poetic spirit!”\\n\\n“But Professor Li’s just as disappointed in Chang Su-su, you\\nknow!”\\n\\n“What! That dull schoolmaster so good that he —?”\\n\\n“He’s certainly very good at some things — money matters, for\\ninstance,”\\n\\n“Oh!... So it’s a question of money, is it?”\\n\\n“Of course! He’s heard that her father’s practically broke now,\\nso he’s every reason to be disappointed in her.”\\n\\nWhen he heard this, Fan Po-wen stared in open-mouthed\\namazement for a moment, then suddenly burst out laughing.\\n\\n“Humph!” he shrugged. “These bourgeois make me sick with\\ntheir ‘money’!”\\n\\n“That’s because you make them sick with your modern poetry!”\\nsaid Wu Chih-sheng sardonically, but with assumed seriousness.\\nFan Po-wen flushed, then immediately paled. He glared resent-\\nfully at Wu Chih-sheng and turned to walk away. He seemed\\ngenuinely upset, but he had only a couple of yards when he\\nturned and came back. He laid his hand on Wu Chih-sheng’s\\nshoulder, and said in a low, serious voice:\\n\\n“I hear they’re going to make a match between you and Lin\\nPei-shan.”\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng’s face registered nothing. He glanced uncon-\\ncernedly at Fan Po-wen, and replied unhurriedly, “Oh, but I’ve\\nheard a different story.”\\n\\n“What’s that? Come on, out with it!”\\n\\n“In this modern age men choose their women, but women also\\nchoose their men. Men toy with women, but women also toy\\nwith men!”\\n\\nFan Po-wen’s face fell and he was tempted to walk away.\\nHe decided this was his unlucky day: everywhere he turned, he\\nran up against a brick wall. It was exasperating. Even his\\nsense of humour seemed to have deserted him, leaving him in\\nan irritable mood. But Wu Chih-sheng pretended not to notice.\\n\\n“To tell you the truth,” he said solemnly, looking Fan Po-wen\\nstraight in the eye, “Lin Pei-shan’s waiting for you.”\\n\\nFan Po-wen started violently, supposing that she hadn’t gone\\nhome after all, but was still in the park waiting for him.\\n\\n“Where’s she waiting for me?” he asked agitatedly.\\n\\n“In her heart, of course —She’s waiting for you to get the Nobel\\nPrize for Literature!”\\n\\nAs he said this, Wu Chih-sheng burst out laughing. Without\\na word, Fan Po-wen turned on his heel and stalked away, this\\ntime in earnest, and disappeared into the trees. Wu Chih-sheng\\ngazed after him with a smile, but he couldn’t help feeling a lit-\\ntle amazed that the poet should stalk off in a rage like this,\\nwithout even a glance over his shoulder, He waited a minute\\nor two until he was sure that the poet was gone for good, then\\nran up on to a mound hidden in a clump of trees lying back\\nfrom the pond.\\n\\n“tHuei-fang!” he called. “It’s getting late. We\\'ll have to get\\na move on if you want to see the zoo.”\\n\\nHuei-fang was leaning against a willow, dabbing her eyes with\\na handkerchief. Without a word, and with only a glance at Wu\\nChih-sheng, she followed him out of the trees. Her eyes were\\nred from crying. When they had gone a short way, she caught\\nup with him and asked him faintly, “Chih-sheng, was he going\\nto throw himself into the pond? He looked as if he was.”\\n\\n“1 didn’t ask him.”\\n\\n“Why not? Well, you should have done, then.—When we were\\nfollowing him just now, he kept behaving strangely, all the way\\nhere. I thought then that there was something wrong. And\\nwhen we met Lin Pei-shan on the way in, she looked a bit out\\n\\nof sorts, too. aa\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng burst out laughing. He gazed at his cousin a\\nmoment before he went on:\\n\\n“Fan Po-wen will never commit suicide, though he’s threatened\\nto do so over and over again. When you thought he was con-\\ntemplating suicide, he was actually composing a poem—QOde to\\na Pond, perhaps. No, a poet like him would never really take\\nhis own life. You needn’t worry about him!”\\n\\n“Humph! I should worry! It’s no concern of mine! Though—”\\n\\nShe blushed as she stopped short and walked on with bent\\nhead. Deep down in her heart she held a picture of Fan Po-wen\\nas a gentle creature deserving of sympathy. She fell back be-\\nhind Wu Chih-sheng again. When they had gone a little farther,\\nshe sighed softly, and, a tear trickled down her cheek.\\n\\n*\\n\\nAn indefinable sadness had come over Huei-fang these last few\\ndays. Her heart seemed as taut as a drum, and the slightest\\nstimulus from others’ joy or sorrow set it vibrating in sympathy.\\nWhen she was alone in her room, she felt numbed by an icy\\ndespair. In company, she felt out of place and nervous, as if\\neveryone was brow-beating her. She felt quite alone in the\\nworld, and wanted more than anything a sympathetic friend, so\\nthat she could fling her arms round his neck and cry her eyes\\nout, and pour out all her troubles to him. These few days in\\nShanghai had seemed an eternity. Her heart was full, but there\\nwas no one to tell.\\n\\nPerhaps it was her loneliness, and this alone, that made her\\nsympathize so easily with the love-lorn Fan Po-wen. However,\\nas she walked along with Wu Chih-sheng, her own troubles and\\nthe changing scenes and faces about her gradually drove the\\npoet’s dear, sad face from her mind. At the zoo, she was at-\\ntracted by a bear in a cage—a huge, black thing pacing to and\\nfro like a philosopher, then rearing up on its hind legs and shak-\\ning its big clumsy head like an idiot. This made her smile, and\\nfor a moment she forgot even her own unhappiness.\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng ran across a fellow-student and fell into con-\\nversation with him. His friend, a brilliant-looking youngster\\ndespite his tousled head of hair, kept glancing at Huei-fang as\\n\\nthey talked together. Their voices gradually dropped to a whis-\\nper, but she caught occasional snatches without really paying\\nmuch attention to what they were saying.\\n\\n“Your flancée?”\\n\\n“No—my cousin!”\\n\\nHuei-fang blushed. Though she did not understand the for-\\neign word “fiancée” she guessed what it meant from Wu Chih-\\nsheng’s answer. She turned away embarrassed and walked over\\nto a cage in which she saw a family of monkeys leaping and\\ngambolling about. They reminded her of a troupe of perform-\\ning monkeys she had seen several years before at a temple fair\\nat home. She could still remember one of them—it kept grin-\\nning and showing a mouthful of gleaming white teeth. That was\\nher last, happy memory of the temple for when she was fourteen\\nand already looked a well-developed young lady, her father, the\\nlate Old Mr. Wu, would not let her go to the temple fairs any\\nmore because he thought the sexes mingled too freely there.\\nNow, at the sight of all these monkeys, memories of her child-\\nhood days came flooding back, and she just stood there dreamily\\nin front of the cage, looking to see whether one of the monkeys\\nwould grin at her.\\n\\nBut of all these monkeys not one grinned. They seemed to\\nhave acquired something of a townsman’s nervousness, for all\\nthey seemed to be doing was scuttling and leaping all over the\\nplace and chattering hysterically. Huei-fang was rather disap-\\npointed, and she was just going to turn away and look for Wu\\nChih-sheng, when something unusual caught her eye. On a\\nwooden box in the corner of the cage were two monkeys, one\\nlounging lazily on its back and the other hunting for lice in the\\nfirst one’s fur, a serious expression on its face. You could tell\\nfrom their intimate manner that there was some close link be-\\ntween them, she thought—yes, that was it! They were husband\\nand wife! Huei-fang just stood there and gazed at them, while\\nan indescribable mixture of feelings tumbled through her mind:\\nsomething akin to gladness—or was it desolation? It was both\\nof these and a sort of empty yearning besides. She did not dare\\nlook, yet she could not bear to tear her eyes away: she just\\nstood there in a trance, until roused by Wu Chih-sheng’s voice.\\n\\n“Come on, they’re closing in a minute.”\\n\\nStartled, she turned her head and gazed blankly at Wu Chih-\\nsheng, not really taking in what he said. Then a sudden blush\\nspread from her tender dimpled cheeks over her whole face.\\n\\nShe felt ashamed and flustered, as if he had read her secret\\nthoughts. She was on the verge of crying, but managed to blink\\nthe tears away. Without a word she turned and walked blindly\\non. The zoo had become almost deserted, but she was quite\\nunaware of the fact. She had only gone a few steps, when she\\ncame to a seat. She sat down dazedly and buried her face in\\nher handkerchief.\\n\\n“Huei-fang, are you feeling all right?” asked Wu Chih-sheng\\nsoftly, obviously blind to what was going on inside her. “The\\nzoo is closing at five, and the keepers are coming round to turn\\nus out.”\\n\\nThis blindness of his was hardly to be wondered at, for he had\\nonly mixed with modern city girls like Lin Pei-shan and Chang\\nSu-su and so, of course, was a complete stranger to the secret\\nsorrows and emotions of old-fashioned “boudoir maidens” like\\nHuei-fang. What was surprising, however, was that his very\\nignorance gave Huei-fang a sense of relief, and she gathered\\nsome comfort from his gentle, sympathetic voice. She uncovered\\nher face and smiled bravely up at him with tear-bright eyes,\\nthen stood up and replied with a trace of shyness:\\n\\n“I’m all right now—let’s go home, then.”\\n\\nThe sun was already disappearing below the horizon, the eve-\\nning breeze was cool and exhilarating, and every moment brought\\na fresh wave of visitors into the park. Wu Chih-sheng would\\nhave preferred to stroll about a little longer, or go and have a\\ndrink at the soda-fountain which had been set up under a mat\\nawning, but Huei-fang was shy of the large crowds, especially\\nthose young couples who always seemed to be looking at her so\\nsuspiciously. She insisted on going home, though she knew she\\nwould not be any happier when she got there.\\n\\nThey were walking back past the pond, where all the benches\\nwere now fully occupied, when they noticed a young man sitting\\non the grass against a tree not far from the pond, his head bent\\nas if he was having a nap. Even from a distance, Huei-fang’s\\nsharp eyes told her that it was Fan Po-wen. She glanced at\\nWu Chih-sheng inquiringly. Wu Chih-sheng, who had also spot-\\n\\nted him, smiled at her and nodded, then crept up behind Fan\\nPo-wen and clapped his hands over his eyes from behind.\\n\\n“Take your hands away! Who is it? Stop messing about\\n\\nFan Po-wen’s protests were half-hearted and he made no at-\\ntempt to move. Huei-fang came up behind Wu Chih-sheng and\\nstood watching for a moment, then stepped lightly round the\\ntree and stood beside Fan Po-wen. Wu Chih-sheng only held\\nhis hands tighter over Fan Po-wen’s eyes, though he could not\\nhelp laughing.\\n\\n“Wu Chih-sheng, is it? I’d know that laugh anywhere. If\\nI’ve guessed wrong, you can cut my head off!”\\n\\n“you didn’t have to guess: I gave myself away.—-Now, guess\\nwho’s here with me.”\\n\\nThis time, Fan Po-wen refused to guess. He just struggled to\\nshake himself free, while his face became quite red from his\\nexertions.\\n\\n“Let go of him, Chih-sheng!” pleaded Huei-fang, feeling sorry\\nfot Fan Po-wen. But as she spoke, Fan Po-wen finally managed\\nto break Wu Chih-sheng’s hold, and sprang to his feet rubbing\\nhis eyes. When he turned round, he saw Huei-fang; he grasped\\nher hand and said with a polite bow:\\n\\n“you’ve saved my life, Miss Wu! I’m deeply grateful to you\\n\\nShe hurriedly snatched her hand away and turned her back on\\nhim, while a sudden blush spread over her cheeks. However,\\nshe could not help asking timidly:\\n\\n“So you haven’t gone back after all, Mr. Fan. What have you\\nbeen doing here all alone?”\\n\\n“Er—composing poems,” he answered, tilting his head on one\\nside and looking up at the sky, as. if, oblivious of everything\\nelse, he was absorbed in reciting his poems mutely to himself.\\nWu Chih-sheng was greatly amused at this, but managed to keep\\na straight face as he threw Huei-fang a meaning look. Fan Po-\\nwen sighed and stamped his foot, then went up to Huei-fang and\\nbegan:\\n\\n“Whenever I’m in low spirits I take comfort in poetry. My\\npoems are my tears. And the worse I feel, the better are my\\npoems.—And now, just as I was putting the finishing touch to\\n& wonderful poem, this lout Chih-sheng had to come along and\\nbreak the spell. Now I’ve forgotten every word of it!”\\n\\n”\\n\\nyp\\n\\nAs she hung upon his every word, Huei-fang gazed at his pale\\nbut stirring face, while her heart fluttered with a strange sensation\\nwhich she never before experienced.\\n\\n“All right, then,” Wu Chih-sheng broke in indifferently: “I\\'ll\\nleave you to your versifying. Good-bye!”\\n\\nHe turned and walked away, swinging his arms. After a mo-\\nment’s hesitation, Huei-fang gave Fan Po-wen a lingering glance\\nand reluctantly followed Wu Chih-sheng. Fan Po-wen gazed\\nafter them until they had almost disappeared into the crowd,\\nthen, with a sudden laugh, he ran after them and caught up with\\nthem.\\n\\n“I don’t feel like composing now,” he said, with a suggestion\\nof pleading in his voice, as he caught Wu Chih-sheng by the arm.\\n“Mind if I tag along?”\\n\\n“But we\\'re going home now,” said Huei-fang, who usually\\nwaited for Wu Chih-sheng to speak first. She smiled shyly at\\nFan Po-wen, then hurriedly dropped her eyes.\\n\\n“Then I\\'ll... I\\'ll come along to your place, too,’ Fan Po-wen\\ndecided after a moment’s hesitation.\\n\\nThey did not talk much on the way. When they reached Wu\\nSun-fu’s house, the porter was just closing the black iron gate,\\nbut, when he saw who it was approaching, he pulled it open\\nagain.\\n\\n“There’s some people here from Shuangchiao Town, Miss,” he\\nsaid with a grin. “They said they got out by the skin of their\\nteeth.”\\n\\nThis news immediately roused Huei-fang from her day-dream-\\ning. With. a little cry of surprise she darted into the house.\\nThree days before she had overheard Wu Sun-fu telling some-\\nbody the bad news about her home town, but it had been so\\nunexpected that she had not thought it could be at all serious,\\nand had dismissed it from her mind. Now she seemed to realize\\nsuddenly that something terrible had actually happened, and her\\nface paled at the thought.\\n\\n*\\n\\nShe found a crowd of people gathered in the large drawing-\\nroom, standing about and talking excitedly. Her eyes first fell\\non Fei Little Beard. The old man was standing there in a grey\\ngown, doing his best to answer a barrage of questions from Mrs.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu and Ah-hsuan at the same time. Huei-fang went\\nover to them and stood watching Fei Little Beard gasping and\\ngesticulating.\\n\\n“tt was at eight o’clock, er, no, nine— that’s it, nine o’clock,\\nMadame, that the Hung Chang Pawnshop went up in flames.—\\nIf Colonel Ho’s two machine-guns hadn’t been there, the rioters\\nand the soldiers who’d mutinied wouldn’t have set fire to the\\nshop — don’t you think so, Madame? The machine-guns were up\\non the turret blazing away like anything but it wasn’t any use!—”\\n\\n“I say, Fei Little Beard!” interrupted Ah-hsuan, tugging at his\\narm. “What happened to my picture-books? I had them in a\\nbox you haven’t told me yet what happened to them.”\\n\\nFei Little Beard could only stare at Ah-hsuan blankly, since he\\nhad not the slightest idea what “picture-books” he meant. Mrs,\\nWu Sun-fu laughed, while Huei-fang took the opportunity to get\\na word in: “Is it true that the whole town’s been ransacked?\\nI wouldn’t believe it—a town as big as that! Was it just the\\npawnshop that was burned down? What about our house?”\\n\\n“Our house wasn’t touched, Huei-fang,” Mrs. Wu Sun-fu as-\\nsured her. “But now we\\'d better let Mr. Fei have a rest—he\\nmust be very tired after all he’s gone through. We can talk\\nabout it later when Sun-fu comes home. But really, a mutiny!”\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu looked suddenly worried, as if she was wres-\\ntling with some knotty problem. She stood staring blankly into\\nspace for a moment, then pulled herself together and forced an\\nunnatural smile. She waved Fei Little Beard to a seat, and then\\nslipped out.\\n\\nAh-hsuan started pestering Fei Little Beard about his box of\\npicture-books again, while Huei-fang turned her attention to a\\ngroup of young men by the window—Fan Po-wen, Wu Chih-\\nsheng, Tu Hsueh-shih, and a stranger in a foreign suit—all listen-\\ning to a man who was telling them how the rioters and\\nmutineers had attacked the pawnshop. Huei-fang thought his\\nvoice sounded familiar but she could not place him just from\\nthe view she had of his back. Suddenly he turned and she could\\nsee his profile: a long horse-like face with a snub-nose, stand-\\nout ears and bristly shock of hair. She saw at once that it was\\nTseng Chia-chu, and it was as much as she could do to suppress\\na startled cry at the sight of him, for she had always loathed\\n\\nhim. Despite the fact that he was posing as a refugee and was\\nbeing regarded with sympathy, Huei-fang still had no wish to\\nsee him, and she wished even less to be drawn into conversation\\nwith him. After some hesitation, she went through into the\\ndining-room and sat down near the open door with her back to\\nthe young men and strained her ears to catch their conversation.\\n\\n“So you snatched a pistol from a mutineer,” came Fan Po-wen’s\\nsarcastic voice, “and had to shoot a few peasants before you\\ncould make your way out of the town, eh? Whew! What a hero!”\\n\\n“Yes, I know how to look after myself all right!”\\n\\n“But what about your father?” asked Tu Hsueh-shih in a\\nvoice even more caustic than Fan Po-wen’s had been, his cat-eyes\\nglaring indignantly as he spoke. “With your immense courage\\nyou should have had no trouble at all in getting him out of\\ndanger. But you only managed to save your own skin. And\\nyou didn’t worry about your wife and child, either!”\\n\\nTseng Chia-chu had not expected a rebuff like this, and for\\nall his boasting he was now beginning to feel that the situation\\nwas becoming embarrassing. Yet, being a born liar, he was\\nunruffled and ready with a brazen reply:\\n\\n“Oh, that. . . . They’re quite safe where they are. Not\\nmany people know them, and anyway, they can always go and\\nhide with some good friends of ours if things get worse. Not\\nlike me: I’m well known all over the town. Wherever I go,\\nthere’s somebody who knows me. Who doesn’t know me, Mr.\\nTseng, Junior?”\\n\\n“Would you please tell us your official position in Shuangchiao\\nTown, Mr. Tseng, Junior? You must be the mayor: I’m sure\\nyou wouldn’t accept anything less, would you?”\\n\\nThis was another cut from Fan Po-wen. As he spoke, he\\nnudged Wu Chih-sheng and winked at Tu Hsueh-shih.\\n\\nThe young man in the foreign suit just stood looking on, a\\ncold smile on his lips and an expression of general discontent\\non his face. He was Tu Hsin-to, Tu Chu-chai’s eldest son and\\nTu Hsueh-shih’s nephew, a student just back from Paris.\\n\\nTseng Chia-chu’s embarrassment was increasing with every\\nminute. Ignoramus though he was, he knew there was no such\\nofficial as mayor in his town, so he was rather surprised at Fan\\nPo-wen’s compliments. But when he looked closely at Fan Po-\\n\\nwen, he changed his mind and told himself that this imposing,\\nwell-dressed man must have had some reason for his remarks\\nand that he himself, ignorant as he was of such matters, must\\nbe mistaken. He smiled uneasily and tried to look important.\\nLittle caring whether he was overstepping the mark with his\\nboasting, he replied without batting an eyelid:\\n\\n“Yes, of course I’m the —er—the mayor of the town. You\\'re\\nquite right I wouldn’t be satisfied with anything less than that.\\nStands to reason. What’s more, I’m number twenty-three, look\\nat this!”\\n\\nHe laid special stress on the word “this,” but nobody appeared\\nto understand what he meant. He quickly fished out of his\\npocket two cards: his visiting card and his party card. He laid\\nthese cards on the upturned palms of his grubby paws and held\\nthem out for inspection. His party card was soiled and. crum-\\npled, but his visiting card was brand-new as he had had it\\nprinted overnight during the three days he had spent in the\\ncounty town after his flight from Shuangchiao Town. Tu Hsueh-\\nshih snatched the cards and was just going to look at them more\\nclosely, when Fan Po-wen burst out laughing, for his sharp eyes\\nhad not only spotted the party card but also the small charac-\\nters on the visiting card identifying its owner as party member\\nNo. 23 of such and such district branch in such and such a\\ncounty.\\n\\nWhen Tu Hsueh-shih also saw these details, he flung the cards\\nangrily on the floor.\\n\\n“Rubbish!” he snapped. “It’s people like you that have\\nruined the country!”\\n\\n“Don’t be so rude, Hsueh-shih!” broke in Wu Chih-sheng, who\\nhad remained silent till now. “Don’t you realize that these cards\\nare more precious than one’s father, wife, and child put together?”\\n\\nThen, with a contemptuous glance at Tseng Chia-chu, he\\ngrasped Fan Po-wen by the arm and pulled him into the dining-\\nroom. Tu Hsueh-shih and Tu Tsin-to followed them, the former\\nkicking the door shut behind him with a bang.\\n\\nThe four of them made a beeline for a sofa under the window,\\nand sat down without noticing Huei-fang sitting quietly by the\\ndoor. They just sat and roared with laughter, while Tu Hsueh-\\nshih continued his imprecations against Tseng Chia-chu. Fan\\n\\nPo-wen happened to be sitting directly opposite Huei-fang, so\\nhe was the first to notice her. He hurriedly stood up and planted\\nhimself in front of the other three.\\n\\n“Guess who else is in the room besides us!’ he said.\\n\\n“Nobody,” came Wu Chih-sheng’s swift reply. “Unless it’s\\nyour love-lorn muse who’s never absent from your mind for a\\nsingle moment.”\\n\\nBut Fan Po-wen, refusing to be drawn, just stepped aside to\\nreveal a blushing Huei-fang. Wu Chih-sheng stood up and said\\nthe first thing that came into his head to cover up his embarrass-\\nment:\\n\\n“Huei-fang, meet Tu Hsin-to, Brother-in-law Chu-chai’s son.”\\n\\n“He’s a student just back from France, Doctor of God-knows-\\nwhat, versed in sericulture and apiculture, artist, Bakuninist, and\\n—” Fan Po-wen had intervened to enumerate Tu Hsin-to’s titles,\\nbut broke off in the middle and burst out laughing.\\n\\nTu Hsin-to neither laughed nor showed any embarrassment.\\nInstead, he bowed gravely to Huei-fang and held out his hand.\\nWhen he saw that she was keeping her hands at her side, and\\nthat she returned his bow rather awkwardly, he smiled pieas-\\nantly and let his hand drop. He had only been back in the\\ncountry three days, but he knew how complicated Chinese so-\\nciety was. It was, perhaps, for this very reason that he had been\\nin a dozen or so schools during his four years in France and had\\ntried his hand at a variety of subjects: horticulture, poultry-\\nfarming, apiculture, mining, water conservancy, textile manu-\\nfacture, ship-building, war chemistry, politics, economics,\\nliterature, philosophy, the fine arts, medicine, applied chemistry\\nand so on and so forth. To each subject he had devoted a few\\ndays or even a few weeks, and so had earned the title of “Doctor\\nof God-knows-what.” If he had acquired anything in particular\\nin France, it was his own version of Bakuninism —a philosophy\\nof life which amounted to “I don’t like anything and I don’t care\\nabout anything.” And this, of course, was just another aspect\\nof his “wide learning.”\\n\\nHad he any ideals? Yes, plenty. To be more accurate, when\\nhe was lying in bed, his head swarmed with ideals; but the\\nmoment he left his bed, all that was left was his attitude of “I\\n\\ndon’t like anything and I don’t care about anything.” He was\\nnot a great talker, but he was quite a mild, affable sort of man.\\n\\nFan Po-wen, Wu Chih-sheng, and Tu Hsueh-shih fell silent, not\\nknowing how to carry on the conversation before the young lady.\\nAlthough Tu Hsin-to did not like to push himself forward and\\nhold forth in company, when he saw that no one seemed willing\\nto say anything he thought there would be no harm in saying\\nsomething to liven up the atmosphere.\\n\\n“Anyone who’s new to Shanghai,” he began lightly, and with\\na smile, “must find it rather. incredible. It’s a hotbed of all sorts\\nof ideologies... . Look at Monsieur Tseng, for instance. You\\nall think him disgusting, but, actually, a man like that is to be\\npitied, too. — Aunt Huei-fang, you must know what he’s like: am\\nI right about him?”\\n\\nHuei-fang was surprised at being called “aunt” by a man\\nseveral years older than herself, and found herself giggling with\\nembarrassment. Fan Po-wen also laughed and clapped Tu Hsin-to\\non the shoulder.\\n\\n“Now don’t you start calling me ‘uncle’!” he warned him. “I\\nwas afraid you might any moment!”\\n\\n“There you go again, Po-wen!” cried Tu Hsueh-shih. “It’s\\npeople like you who do nothing but joke that are ruining the\\ncountry!—And as for that fellow Tseng, he’s really shocking. It\\nmakes me furious just to think about him. Didn’t I tell you\\nwhen we saw him arrive that he was a rotter? Well, now we\\'ve\\nproved it! I’d like to give him what for. If it had been any-\\nwhere but here, I’d have given him a good hiding.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he glared round and puffed out his cheeks, so that\\nhe looked perfectly ridiculous, as he always did when he was\\nangry. It was now Fan Po-wen’s turn for another quip.\\n\\n“That’s right! Give him what for! You’re just the right man\\nfor the job. You can hit him with the ‘mailed fist? yow’re always\\ntalking about, but he can take it, because he’s so thick-skinned!”\\n\\n“I quite agree with you, Mr. Tu,” broke in Huei-fang. “Mr.\\nTseng is really horrible. He has such shifty eyes.—Oh, I wish\\nI knew how things really are at home!”\\n\\nShe had thrown off her shyness to say this because she was\\nafraid that Tu Hsueh-shih and Fan Po-wen were going to start\\nquarrelling. Her interruption had divertéd the conversation to\\n\\nShuangchiao Town for a while. Tu Hsin-to remained reticent\\nand looked on with an indifferent smile, though he nodded his\\nappreciation of Fan Po-wen’s witticism. They were, in a way,\\nthe best of friends. Tu Hsueh-shih disliked his nephew just\\nas much as he did Fan Po-wen. He said harshly to the latter:\\n\\n“You just keep your mouth shut, Po-wen! Freedom of speech\\nis China’s curse. Too many cooks spoil the broth, you know.\\nOur only hope is to put the reins of government into iron hands,\\nand put a stop to all this idle chatter. The reason why bandits\\nare always on the rampage is because our military commanders\\nare not doing their job properly. As likely as not some of them\\nare even giving the bandits a free hand so that they\\'ll have a\\nchance of distinguishing themselves—”\\n\\n“Yes, but everyone’s got to live-—even a bandit,” interposed\\nWu Chih-sheng. “There’s no two ways about it. The reason\\nwhy there are so many bandits about isn’t as simple as you\\nmight think.”\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng firmly believed that, as long as the problem of\\ndistribution of wealth remained unsolved, China—and, indeed\\nthe whole world—would remain in chaos.\\n\\n“Yes, everyone’s got to live,” agreed Fan Po-wen. “But I\\nthink the root of all the trouble is money. It’s because of\\nmoney that Shuangchiao Town’s been attacked and looted. It’s\\nbecause of money that capitalists are building factories where\\nthere used to be paddy fields. The smoke from factory chimneys\\nblots out the-sky and pollutes the beauties of nature. And it’s\\nbecause of money that peasants leave their lovely villages and\\ncrowd into the city to live in grimy rabbit-warrens and submerge\\ntheir humanity!”\\n\\nAs Fan Po-wen once more gave vent to his poet’s longing for\\nunspoiled natural beauty, he glanced at Huei-fang. She did not\\nunderstand much of what he was saying, but, when she saw the\\nlook of utter sadness on his face, she warmed to him and a\\nspontaneous smile of sympathy came to her lips.\\n\\nTu Hsueh-shih’s mouth was working with impatience and he\\nwas just going to cut Fan Po-wen short, when Lin Pei-shan\\nburst into the room, bag in hand, apparently just back from a\\nstroll. Her first words were: “Have you seen the wild horse\\n\\nand the clay idol in the other room? I thought I’d come to the\\nwrong house!”\\n\\nEveryone roared with laughter. Lin Pei-shan twirled round\\nto see Fan Po-wen and Tu Hsueh-shih. Her gaiety suddenly\\nvanished. Pressing her lips together in a wry smile, she swept\\nacross the room and out through the back door.\\n\\nShe ran upstairs and burst into her sister\\'s room. The light-\\nblue satin curtains were drawn and the room was in darkness.\\nShe touched the switch and the sudden blaze of light roused her\\nsister, who was lying back on a sofa in a reverie.\\n\\nThe sisters looked at each other in silence, then Lin Pei-shan\\nran across and crouched down beside her sister. She flung\\nher arms round her neck and whispered anxiously, “Oh, Pei-yao!\\nHe—he said it to me today. What shall I do!”\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu, not understanding who had said what, turned\\nto look her sister in the face and saw that she looked both anxious\\nand miserable.\\n\\n“1 mean Fan Po-wen—he said he loves me!”\\n\\n“Well, are you in love with him?”\\n\\n“Me? I don’t know.”\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu could not help laughing. She shook her head,\\nand extricated herself from Lin Pei-shan’s embrace. She was\\ngoing to say something when her sister went on: “I feel I love\\neverybody and yet nobody.”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t be silly!”\\n\\n“Shouldn’t I say that?”\\n\\n“It may be true, but you shouldn’t think things like that, be-\\ncause one day you\\'ll have to get married—you’ll have to make up\\nyour mind about someone—someone to be your life companion.”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan inclined her head in thought for a moment, then\\nrose to her feet and said dejectedly, “To be all the time with\\none and the same man? How monotonous! Look at you and\\nSun-fu—!”\\n\\nAt this Mrs. Wu Sun-fu started with surprise, and a couple\\nof things she had in her lap tumbled on to the floor: a tattered\\ncopy of The Sorrows of Young Werther and a faded white rose.\\nAs Mrs. Wu Sun-fu gazed down abstractedly at them, her heart-\\nache which had been temporarily interrupted by the arrival of\\nher sister, now came back with renewed vigour.\\n\\n“Would you say that Sun-fu isn’t terribly keen on Fan Po-wen,\\nthen?” asked Lin Pei-shan at last, though her voice betrayed no\\ninterest. With an effort, Mrs. Wu Sun-fu repressed her own tur-\\nbulent feelings and looked up at her sister. After a moment’s\\nsilence she answered, ‘Yes: he has in mind another man who, he\\nthinks, is even more eligible than Fan Po-wen.”\\n\\n“Is it Tu Hsueh-shih, the one you were telling me about?”\\n\\n“What do you think of him?”\\n\\n“I’m sure I don’t know.”\\n\\nThis “don’t know” business perplexed Mrs. Wu Sun-fu until\\nshe noticed an unusual glint in Pei-shan’s eye which made her\\ndecide that her sister was just being shy. She laughed and asked\\nsoftly, “Won\\'t you even take your own sister into your con-\\nfidence? Just say one word and I’ll understand.”\\n\\n“I think ... if I marry Tu Hsueh-shih, PH always be thinking\\nof somebody else—”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan broke off, and a faint flush crept into her cheeks.\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu felt her own heart beating faster at these words.\\nLin Pei-shan tittered nervously, then averted her face, and mut-\\ntered as if to herself:\\n\\n“To marry one man and always be thinking of someone else—\\nwouldn’t that be horrid, Pei-yao!”\\n\\nAs she said this, she flung herself upon Mrs. Wu Sun-fu, put\\nher hands on her shoulders, and buried her face in hers like a\\nchild. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face was burning hot, and Lin Pei-shan\\nstarted back in surprise when she felt it. When she looked and\\nsaw that her sister’s face was flushed and that there were tears\\nglistening between her lashes, she could only stare in amaze-\\nment. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face slowly paled as she saw through\\nher tears the image of herself before her marriage in her sister\\nstanding before her: the same looks, the same figure, and the\\nsame innocence and vivacity tinged with fantasy as she had had.\\nAnd like herself her sister was now at the crossroads, and in\\ndanger of being drawn into a life which did not make sense.\\nSurely her sister was not destined to share her own fate? She\\nfelt sick at heart as these thoughts went through her mind.\\n\\n“Pei-shan,” she blurted out tremulously, “who is it you’re al-\\nways thinking about? Po-wen?”\\n\\n“No, it’s not him—oh, I don’t know! Oh, Pei-yao, I want to\\ncry—I just want to cry!”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan flung her arms round Mrs, Wu Sun-fu and hugged\\nher close as she said this. Her voice trembled but she did not\\nburst into tears. All at once, she let go of Mrs. Wu Sun-fu with\\na nervous giggle and skipped out of the room again.\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu stared at the waving blue curtain cver the\\ndoor, then parted her lips to call her sister back, but changed\\nher mind. Two large tears welled up in her eyes and fell on\\nto her hand. As she bent her head to look at the book and the\\nfaded white rose lying on the carpet at her feet, a wave of over-\\nwhelming sorrow swept over her. She threw herself face down-\\nwards on the sofa in a daze and moaned miserably,\\n\\n“ty9w about Pei-shan? Can she be taking my place? ... No,\\nsurely not! Who is it she’s got in mind, then? Oh, my foolish\\nheart! They say the fighting’s getting worse at the front... .\\nIf he’s killed, it’s finished, finished! — But didn’t he say he’d\\ncome back? Oh, I\\'ll be afraid to see him again.... Oh for-\\ngive me, let me go! Let me go and hide myself somewhere!”\\nVil\\n\\nTHREE days later. All the morning not a breath of wind had\\nstirred. The sky was heavy with becalmed banks of grey cloud,\\nbehind which sidled a watery sun. Dragon-flies zigzagged among\\nthe trees, bumping from time to time against the greyish-green\\nwire-netting screens over the windows and startling the flies\\nwhich had settled there, so that they flew up with a buzz and\\ncircled aimlessly around in front of the windows awhile, before\\nsettling again to crawl on the screens, where they would stretch\\nout their hind legs and rub them slowly together as if they were\\ndeep in thought.\\n\\nInside the wire-screened windows was the Wus’ luxuriously\\nfurnished drawing-room, with Wu Sun-fu pacing up and down,\\nhis face as clouded as the sky. Suddenly he stopped and looked\\nup at the clock on the wall.\\n\\n“Eleven already,” he muttered, “and still no ring!”\\n\\nHe had been waiting anxiously for a telephone call from Chao\\nPo-tao and Tu Chu-chai, for it was today that the fate of their\\njoint speculation in government bonds would be decided. For\\nthe last few days the market had been buzzing with the news\\nthat the Central Army was beginning to win its battles. But\\nspeculators in general preferred to bide their time; only small\\nbuyers were active, but they could not push up the prices to any\\nappreciable extent. The day before, the victories of the Central\\nArmy had been splashed across the front page of every news-\\npaper. This morning, the early session of the Exchange had\\nopened with a two-to-three-dollar rise on all government bonds.\\nOn the floor a sea of heads pushed and jostled, and the shout-\\ning of buyers and sellers made the plate sound like a field of\\nbattle, so that it was impossible to make oneself heard above the\\ndin. The raised hands were all palm-upwards. But Chao Po-\\n\\ntao needed only to unload about two million to make the prices\\ndrop again to only fifty cents above the quotation of two days\\nbefore. People said that the big bears had decided to hold out\\nuntil today and see which way the wind was blowing before\\nbuying in. The fate of Wu Sun-fu and his fellow-speculators\\nwould be decided within the next twelve hours, for the settle-\\nment was due the following day.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu frowned as he looked out through the window at\\nthe sullen sky, then smiled with an air of resignation and strode\\ninto the library to ring up Tu Wei-yueh at the factory. On this\\nfront he was rather more confident of victory, but here, too, today\\nwas the day which would decide the outcome. This morning was\\nthe deadline for Tu Wei-yueh and Mo Kan-cheng to put an end\\nto the week-old go-slow strike.\\n\\nHe was just picking up the telephone, when the door opened\\nand a squarish face with a tuft of beard on its chin peered\\nround the door as if wondering whether to come in or wait\\noutside. Wu Sun-fu put down the receiver and called out, “Come\\non in, Fei. Any reliable news?”\\n\\nFei Little Beard squeezed in crabwise, closed the door quietly\\nand tiptoed across to the desk where Wu Sun-fu was sitting.\\n\\n“Yes, there’s some,” he muttered timidly, looking down at the\\nfloor. “But it’s not too good. The bandits have withdrawn from\\nthe town and spread out into the surrounding villages. All the\\nshops in the town are still closed. The troops sent out by pro-\\nvincial authorities are still stationed in the county town, and\\nare afraid to come anywhere near—”\\n\\n“Troops be damned!” Wu Sun-fu interrupted impatiently. “Just\\ntell me about my losses.” In his agitated state of mind, he found\\nthe cheerless gloom of the room depressing, so he reached across\\nthe desk and flicked on the table-lamp. The light which filtered\\nthrough the yellow silk shade picked out his gloomy, purplish\\nface and his thick eyebrows twitching with anxiety above his\\nruthless eyes.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, the losses .. . er, it hasn’t been possible to make a\\nclear estimate yet. I’m afraid the losses are considerable—the\\nHung Chang Pawnshop, the Tung Yuan local bank, the oil-\\nrefinery, the power-house—”\\n\\n“I know they’ve been ransacked; you needn’t tell me about that\\nagain! What I want is a detailed list of definite losses, not a\\nrough estimate! You stayed in the town three days just to teil\\nme all this, eh! Three days, and you still haven’t made a clear\\nestimate? Pah!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu became angrier with each word and pounded on\\nthe desk. What made him angry was not so much the losses\\nhe had sustained—he could well afford to dismiss a loss of a\\nhundred or two hundred thousand dollars with a mere frown—\\nno; it was Fei Little Beard’s dithering and incompetence that\\nmade him so furious. Moreover, he was on tenterhooks to know\\nhow much money was left over after the losses, so that he\\ncould plan ahead how to tide over his present financial difficul-\\nties on the eve of the Dragon-boat Festival.\\n\\nSeeing that Fei Little Beard was tongue-tied, Wu Sun-fu went\\non, “Now, how much do you think we can get back on our\\nloans?”\\n\\n“Let me see... sixty per cent, I should think, seeing that\\nmost of the shops in the town haven’t suffered much loss. Only\\nthe rice-shops, the piece-goods shops were cleaned out. Yes, I\\nthink there’s a good chance of getting back sixty per cent. Be-\\nsides, the county town is still intact—”\\n\\n“You should have told me all this sooner Wu Sun-fu cut\\nFei Little Beard short once more, but he sounded more peaceable\\nnow, and a ghost of a smile passed across his lips. He was\\nconfronted with three major problems: the go-slow strike at the\\nfactory, the Stock Exchange battle, and the rebellion in his\\nhome town. He now had a clue to the third problem, for sixty\\nper cent of his loans meant about sixty or seventy thousand\\ndollars in cash at his disposal. It was not a big sum, but, like\\na commander-in-chief in planning an offensive, now that he\\nknew what forces he had in hand, he knew how best to deploy\\nthem for the attack.\\n\\n“One of the motors in the power-house is damaged—” Fei Little\\nBeard stammered, hanging his head. However, before he finished\\nhis sentence, there was a sudden fiash of lightning, followed by\\na deafening clap of thunder which seemed to rock the room;\\nand on top of the thunder came a torrential downpour, and Fei\\nLittle Beard’s feeble voice was swallowed up by the angry roar\\n\\nyp\\n\\nof the elements. Just then Tu Chu-chai burst into the room, his\\ngoat-like face glistening with beads of sweat.\\n\\n“Whew, what a thunderstorm!” he exclaimed. “No wonder\\nthe phones are out of order. Your phone’s out, isn’t it, Sun-fu?”\\n\\nHe sat down on a sofa opposite Wu Sun-fu and pulled out a\\nlarge handkerchief. He spread it over his face and began wiping\\nvigorously. This was not just to wipe away the perspiration:\\nit was something he always did whenever he was in a quandary.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu knew at once that something had gone wrong on\\nthe Exchange. He smiled slightly and, strangely enough, he\\nnow felt more at peace in his mind. In another minute or two\\nhe would know whether they had won or whether they had lost.\\nThough, of course, it was quite natural for a man as far-sighted\\nand broad-minded as he was to be as cool and calm as usual.\\nHe turned to Fei Little Beard and waved him away.\\n\\n“Pei, you’d better leave for Shuangchiao Town at once. Collect\\nas much of the money as you can and bring it back to me without\\ndelay. Don’t worry about the damaged motor in the power-\\nhouse: I’ll send someone down to see to it tomorrow. You must\\ntry and get to the town before nightfall. You can hire a motor-\\nboat, and you leave before one o’clock. That’s all. Off you go!”\\n\\n“Very good—” Fei Little Beard assented dismally. He had\\ncome ashore from a steam-launch less than an hour back, and\\nhad scarcely had time yet to stretch his legs. Now he was\\ntold to embark again—to crouch in a little boat and to be swayed\\nand jolted about! To go back to a town surrounded and watched\\nby armed peasants! This was certainly an unpalatable proposi-\\ntion. But he knew his hasty-tempered master would brook no\\ndisobedience, so he swallowed his disappointment, and shook\\ndown his gown and left without another word. Wu Sun-fu and\\nTu Chu-chai began talking about the day’s events on the\\nExchange.\\n\\nTheir conversation was hardly audible against the crash of the\\nthunder, and the roar of the rain, but by watching Tu Chu-chai’s\\nlip movements, Wu Sun-fu managed to get the gist of what he\\nwas saying. When the lips stopped for a moment, Wu Sun-fu\\nlaughed bitterly and shouted, “You say there are still new bears\\nturning up? They must be mad!”\\n\\n“That’s what’s so queer about it all. I’ve never seen such a\\ncrazy market. Wait and see what happens in the afternoon\\nsession, though.”\\n\\n“What have we got left in hand?”\\n\\n“Four or five million. If we unload them, we can stop the rise\\nand turn it into a drop. If we don’t, we\\'re sunk.”\\n\\n“Unload the lot, then. Anyway, we shan’t be losing on it.”\\n\\n“Oh, no? Have you forgotten that we’ve paid out three hun-\\ndred thousand dollars?”\\n\\n“No, I haven’t forgotten,” said Wu Sun-fu gloomily, “but the\\nloss won’t work out at more than eighty thousand dollars apiece,\\nand we can write that off as ‘military expenses.’”\\n\\nHe stood up and began pacing up and down. The thunder\\nhad stopped by now, but the rain was coming down in torrents\\nand a wind had sprung up; and to the noise of the storm was\\nadded the howling of the wind in the trees outside. Tu Chu-chai\\nsat in silence, imagining he was back on the floor of the Exchange\\nin the seething, bawling crowd with its tense, sweating faces\\nand its foul, stifling atmosphere. And all this confusion was\\ncaused mainly by Chao Po-tao and himself and the other two\\nplotting behind the scenes and now they were hoist with their\\nown petard! It was terrible! Tu Chu-chai shook his head and\\nsighed.\\n\\n“TY just can’t understand why so many big bears are still hold-\\ning out and refusing to cover. Tomorrow’s settlement day, and\\nyet this morning new bears were still cropping up!”\\n\\n“But is it that new bears are cropping up? Or is it just Chao\\nPo-tao playing a shabby trick?”\\n\\nAs he said this, Wu Sun-fu suddenly turned to look Tu Chu-\\nchai in the face and thumped the table with his hand. The other\\nsprang to his feet in dismay. Why had he not thought of this\\nbefore? He must have been dazed by the noise and stuffiness\\non the floor of the Exchange! His voice was excited and angry\\nas he replied:\\n\\n“Oho! So that’s it, is it? Yes, I wouldn’t be at all surprised.\\nBut what an infernal cheek!”\\n\\n“Yes, we’ve been taken in nicely!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu threw back his head and laughed bitterly, but his\\nvoice was drowned by a sudden clap of thunder. Tu Chu-chai\\nlit a cigar and puffed vigorously at it before observing slowly:\\n\\n“Tf it’s true, then Chao Po-tao’s no friend of ours. Anyway,\\nwe won\\'t let him get away with it—But we\\'d better wait and\\nsee what happens in the afternoon session, Sun-fu. It’s too early\\nyet to know for certain how things will turn out.”\\n\\n“Let’s hope so!”\\n\\n“tts not merely a hope—we’ve a good chance of snatching a\\nvictory at the last minute. I’m going to see Shang Chung-li\\nright away, and then, after lunch, I\\'ll go along to the Exchange\\nand see what’s happening.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai rose to go, and Wu Sun-fu followed him out to\\nthe front steps. Just as he was getting into the car, Tu Chu-chai\\nsuddenly stopped, turned round, and pulled Wu Sun-fu back\\nindoors, where he asked him gravely:\\n\\n“what news has Fei Little Beard brought back from the town?\\nWhat are the losses?”\\n\\n“He didn’t give me a clear picture—no details.”\\n\\n“What did you send him straight back for just now?”\\n\\n“To collect what’s left over,” smiled Wu Sun-fu, his look of\\ndespondency vanishing abruptly. “You see, I’m going to con-\\ncentrate all my financial strength on that trust company and\\nturn it into a base for big operations.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai hesitated a moment, and then asked, “Are you\\nreally set on going through with this business of Chu Yin-chiu?\\nAre you sure it isn’t a bit touch-and-go?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu made no reply to this question, and only glanced\\nat Tu Chu-chai.\\n\\n“7 admit I don’t know much about industry and so on,” Tu\\nChu-chai went on, “but as far as I can see its future isn’t going\\nto be all roses. Besides, Chu Yin-chiu’s no fool and he knows\\nquite well his machines and factory buildings are worth more\\nthan five hundred thousand dollars. You don’t imagine he’d let\\nus take over for only three hundred thousand? Besides, he’s a\\nbit of a backbiter, and he’d give us a bad name and make things\\nawkward for us if we tried to force something out of him. I\\nhear he’s already putting it about that we’re trying to twist\\nhim foul and so on. I met Chao Po-tao just a short while ago,\\n\\nand he gave me to understand that Chu Yin-chiu was already\\nnegotiating with him for a loan of a hundred and fifty thousand\\ndollars or so on his machinery so that he can pay back the loan\\nwe made him on his cocoons when it falls due in a month\\'s\\ntime—”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai broke off inconclusively and flicked the ash off his\\ncigar. Then he turned to gaze out of the window at the rain,\\nwhich was coming down in sheets, although the sky seemed to\\nbe clearing slightly. When he turned round again, it was to see\\nWu Sun-fu smiling mirthlessly.\\n\\n“And did Chao Po-tao promise him a loan?” Wu Sun-fu\\nasked.\\n\\n“He’s probably still thinking it over. Since he’s going in with\\nus in our company, he’s being very courteous and considerate on\\nthe surface. He said that if a loan to Chu Yin-chiu is harmful\\nto our interests, he’ll have to refuse it—”\\n\\n“You must definitely tell him to refuse it, then, Chu-chai.”\\n\\n“That\\'s just what I wanted to discuss with you. So far as\\nI can see, the silk industry’s in a bad way just now, so I think\\nwe\\'d better go carefully. If Chu Yin-chiu can get the money\\nfrom Chao Po-tao to pay back his loan, we can let it go at that.”\\n\\n“No, Chu-chai!” protested Wu Sun-fu, jumping up. “We can’t\\njust sit back and let things slide!”\\n\\nA shaft of sunlight escaped through a rift in the clouds behind\\nthe curtain of rain and bathed his face in a yellowish glow.\\nWu Sun-fu’s voice rose above the drumming of the rain. “We\\'ve\\nbeen doing our damnedest to relieve Chu Yin-chiu of his cocoons.\\nWe can’t give up now, just when we\\'ve almost got our hands\\non them! No, Chu-chai, we can’t just let things slide! Tell\\nChao Po-tao to refuse him the loan. Our trust company has the\\npriority of making him loans: we made a special stipulation\\nto that effect in the contract of the old loan. In fact, as you may\\nremember, we let him off with a favourable rate of interest—\\na mere five and a half per cent a month—in exchange for that\\nstipulation. Chu-chai, you must tell Chao Po-tao that he must\\nrespect our contract rights.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai stared at Wu Sun-fu for a moment, then took\\nthe cigar out of his mouth, and said with a sigh, “Well, we shall\\nsee what we can do after we’re through with the most urgent\\n\\nbusiness. At the moment our stock business is quite a handful.\\nI’m off to see Shang Chung-li now.”\\n\\nThe rain was easing up and turning to a thick, misty drizzle,\\nwhile the sky was more leaden and overcast than ever. And\\nWu Sun-fu’s heart felt as leaden as the sky. There was still a\\nray of hope, though, since there were so many unpredictable\\nfluctuations on the Stock Exchange; but the signs of the last two\\ndays, however, seemed to indicate that somebody was out to\\nkill the bulls—which was really rather odd. There could be only\\none explanation: their secret must have leaked out already! Wu\\nSun-fu had never trusted Chao Po-tao and now he could not help\\nsuspecting that he was stabbing him in the back. He paced up\\nand down, his hands clasped behind his back, thinking to him-\\nself: A gamble on the stock market isn’t much of a risk—unless\\nyou go in with Chao Po-tao, and then you’re taking a very great\\nrisk indeed!\\n\\nIt was now already half past eleven, but Tu Wei-yueh at the\\nfactory had not yet telephoned the expected news of victory.\\nSince there was no point in worrying about Chao Po-tao and\\nthe stock speculations for the moment, Wu Sun-fu mustered up\\nhis energies to deal with the situation in the. factory. He told\\nKao Sheng to ring through, but it turned out that the telephone\\nwas in fact out of order, and it was impossible to get through.\\nExasperated, he jumped into his car and left for the factory to\\ninvestigate in person.\\n\\nIn the streets, everything beyond a radius of fifteen yards or\\nso was shrouded by the drizzle and appeared as a misty blur.\\nThe top floors of several tall buildings were visible through the\\nmist, their windows shimmering with a pale, yellowish light like\\nrows of great eyes. From a distance they seemed to be floating\\nin mid-air, like buildings seen in a mirage, instead of being their\\nusual solid and imposing selves. There seemed to be no end to\\nthis thick mist, and as the car ploughed on through its clinging\\ndampness the wind-screen became like frosted glass, so that\\neven the nearest passers-by seemed to be so many grotesque\\nphantoms; everything had undergone a misty sea-change and\\nevery outline had become blurred.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was slumped back in the right-hand corner of the\\ncar, his left leg sprawled along the seat beside him as he glanced\\nout of the windows, breathing heavily. Suddenly an unusual\\nsensation came over him: he was one of the captains of industry,\\nruthless and go-ahead—yet were his prospects really anything\\nmore than a mirage — just castles in the air? And what were\\nthe people around him but so many blurred, misshapen figures?\\nHis progress in industry was just like his present journey—an\\naimless rush through a blinding mist!\\n\\nA chilly sensation crept up his spine and spread out until his\\nface paled and his eyes lost the sheen of courage and keenness.\\n\\nThe car turned in through the factory gates and past the\\nworkshops with their windows dismally lit up by the yellowish\\nglare from inside. The damp air vibrated with the smooth hum\\nof machinery. In the ordinary way, this hum would have made\\nhim feel elated and his experienced ear would immediately have\\ntold him the tempo of work, but just now, although his senses\\nwere as alert as ever, his mind was clouded and his heart heavy.\\n\\nHe waited until Kuan, his bodyguard, had opened the car door\\nfor him before he slowly got out. Mo Kan-cheng and Tu Wei-\\nyueh had already come out to meet him, and when Mo saw how\\nashen and grim his face was, his heart sank. Wu Sun-fu glanced\\ncoldly at Mo Kan-cheng and then at Tu Wei-yueh and made\\nstraight for his office.\\n\\nHe called Tu Wei-yueh in first. The young man seemed quite\\ncalm and at his ease as he said, without waiting until he was\\nspoken to, “Your telephone at home was out of order, sir, and\\nI couldn’t get througn until ten minutes ago, and by that time\\nyou were already on your way. They got the line back into\\nservice just a bit too late to catch you, unfortunately.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu could not help a slight frown, but he nevertheless\\nforced a smile. He sensed the implication behind Tu Wei-yueh’s\\nwords: that it was really not necessary for him to come to the\\nfactory at this moment. The arrogant, cocksure young man ob-\\nviously thought that by dashing over to the factory in such a\\nfluster, instead of waiting at home for the news of victory (as\\nthey had arranged beforehand), Wu Sun-fu was not showing\\nabsolute confidence in his trusted lieutenant, which was not in\\nkeeping with the time-honoured principle of “If you use a man,\\n\\ndon’t suspect him; if you suspect a man, don’t use him,” and\\nwas not at all the way a really great man went about things.\\nAs he looked into Tu Wei-yueh’s face, Wu Sun-fu secretly\\napplauded his firmness and astuteness, though he dared not\\nadmit to the young man that the reason he had hurried over so\\nsoon was that he had had qualms about his ability to carry\\nout his task. He smiled faintly and said reassuringly:\\n\\n“Well, it’s nearly twelve o’clock, isn’t it? I expected to find\\nthat my commander at the front had been completely victorious,\\nI’ve come, rather unexpectedly perhaps, to speak to the prisoners,\\nas it were.”\\n\\n“Even so, you’ve come just a bit too early, Mr. Wu,” said Tu\\nWei-yueh bluntly, his face as calm and impassive as ever.\\n\\n“What! But didn’t I just hear the machines—~do you mean\\nto tell me they’re just letting the machines run on as usual, and\\ngoing slow the way they’ve been doing the last few days?”\\n\\n“Please go in and you can see for yourself, sir,’ Tu Wei-yueh\\nsaid unhurriedly, as cool and dignified as ever.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu snorted and glared at Tu Wei-yueh, his piercing\\neyes filled with a mounting rage. But the young man was\\nunabashed: he just drew himself up and met the glare with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n“T should like your instructions, sir,” he asked abruptly. “Are\\nyou still set on a ‘peaceful settlement’?”\\n\\n“Of course I am, but there’s a limit to my patience!”\\n\\n“T see! ... and you set the deadline for today—you said that\\nthe day before yesterday. But, after all, the workwomen are\\nhuman beings—they’ve got their own ideas and feelings. But\\nwhat makes things worse is that their ideas are complicated and\\ntheir feelings are easily roused. For example, three days ago\\nthey were all for Yao Chin-feng, the girl in Row 12, but today\\nthey’ve turned on her; they’re calling her a stooge and accusing\\nher of betraying their interests. The situation’s taken a turn for\\nthe worse just now. You probably remember Yao Chin-feng: tall\\nand thin, little round face, slightly pockmarked, thirtyish, been\\nhere three years and six months? Well, as a matter of fact it\\nwas she who started the strike—”\\n\\n“Yes, I remember her: the one you were working on to bring\\nher round.”\\n\\n“1 did bring her round, but now all the other women are calling\\nher a stooge in our service, and of course a known stooge is no\\nearthly use to us. All the work I’ve put in on her for the past\\nfew days has just been wasted.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu snorted, but said nothing.\\n\\n“We\\'ve been very careful about the whole thing,” went on\\nTu Wei-yueh, “and only a very few of our people were in the\\nknow; and anyway, Yao Chin-feng still kept up a pretence of\\nbeing on the side of the women. I don’t suppose for a minute\\nthe women had the slightest suspicion that their leader had\\nbeen bought over, so it’s quite clear that it’s one of our people\\nwho has let on about it.”\\n\\n“Qh! So that’s it, is it? Have you found out who it was?”\\n\\n“yes: Hsueh Pao-chu, one of the forewomen. By splitting on\\nus like that, she’s sabotaged the whole plan.”\\n\\n“What! One of the forewomen do a thing like that—try to\\ncurry favour with the women? She must be mad!”\\n\\n“It’s all because of jealousy. Those two women are deadly\\nenemies—Hsueh Pao-chu is envious of Yao Chin-feng’s merit.”\\n\\n“Call them in to see me!” snapped Wu Sun-fu, springing to\\nhis feet. But Tu Wei-yueh remained still, waiting for Wu Sun-\\nfu to cool down and countermand this futile order of his. Wu\\nSun-fu stared at Tu Wei-yueh for a while, then slowly recovered\\nhis composure and sat down again.\\n\\n“The interfering bitch!” he muttered to himself through clenched\\nteeth. “She’s making more trouble than all the women put\\ntogether! So she’s fed up with working for me, eh? — Right:\\nWei-yueh, tell Mo Kan-cheng to give this Hsueh woman the\\nsack!”\\n\\n“Don’t you think there’s an even better way out than that,\\nMr. Wu?”\\n\\n“Eh? What do you think we ought to do, then?” Wu Sun-fu’s\\ntone of voice was sharp, as if his patience was finally exhausted.\\n\\n“I would suggest, Mr. Wu, that you put up a notice announc-\\ning three things: double pay for the day of the Dragon-boat Fes-\\ntival; the discharge of Yao Chin-feng and the promotion of Hsueh\\nPao-chu to the rank of supervisor,” Tu Wei-yueh spoke with\\ndeliberation, drawing himself up boldly as he did so. Wu Sun-\\n\\nfu listened in silence, gazing meditatively into space with nar-\\nrowed eyes for a short while. Suddenly he laughed and said:\\n\\n“A counterplot, eh? Are you sure it\\'ll work?”\\n\\n“Yes, I think so. Since eight o’clock this morning I’ve been\\ndoing my best to patch up the awkward situation created by\\nHsueh Pao-chu, and I think I’m getting somewhere at last. I’ve\\njust remembered: you’ve already approved the double pay. I\\nhope you\\'ll also agree to the discharge of Yao Chin-feng and the\\npromotion of Hsueh Pao-chu. Later on we can countermand\\nthese orders; then itll be regarded by the women as a conces-\\nsion to them and be the means of clearing up the trouble. After\\nall the trouble we’ve been to to get Yao Chin-feng as our con-\\ntact among the women, we can’t discard her just like that.”\\n\\nA sudden blast from the hooter resounded through the factory\\nmaking Wu Sun-fu start violently and pale slightly. Didn\\'t fac-\\ntory workers always sound the hooter as signal for a riot? The\\nnext instant he realized it was the signal for lunch-break, and\\nhis smile of relief also gave his tacit consent to Tu Wei-yueh’s\\nproposal.\\n\\n“The trouble will be over by this afternoon, I can assure you,\\nMr. Wu. After that there’ll be nothing more to do but give rewards\\nto a number of people for the help they’ve given us. May I have\\nyour instructions in this connection?”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh laid before Wu Sun-fu a list of recommendations\\nwhich he had prepared. The latter ran his eyes over it and then\\nasked with a frown, “These two fellows Chien Pao-sheng and\\nKuei Chang-lin are members of the trade union. Must we give\\nthem rewards as well?”\\n\\n“Yes, I think we must. They have different backgrounds and\\nbelong to different factions, but this time they’ve managed to\\ncome to an agreement on the question of working for your in-\\nterests.”\\n\\n“Agreement? Yes, they’re sure to be in agreement about\\ntapping me for money; but they’re far from being in agreement\\nwhen it comes to fighting for power in the union or taking\\nadvantage of trouble among the women to score off one another.\\nAs a matter of fact, the main reason why this go-slow trouble\\nhas dragged on for nearly a week is that these two scoundrels\\n\\nhave been at loggerheads: they couldn’t agree on working for me\\nand dealing with the women!”\\n\\n“But they haven’t quarrelled for the last two or three days.\\nChien Pao-sheng’s even taken my advice to yield a bit to Kuei\\nChang-lin.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t mean that they\\'re really out to work for me:\\nthey’re just trimming their sails to the wind, for their own ends.\\nI could well afford it, but I just won’t give a penny to people\\nlike that.”\\n\\nWith this firm rebuff, Wu Sun-fu snatched up a pen and cross-\\ned the two names off the list, then initialled it and handed it\\nback to Tu Wei-yueh. He stood up and looked out of the\\nwindow at the women passing by. He frowned as a disagree-\\nable momory came back to him, but almost immediately his ex-\\npression returned to normal. As he left the office, he enjoined\\nTu Wei-yueh once more:\\n\\n“It’s imperative that the whole thing be settled by tomorrow.\\nMy patience ends today.”\\n\\nHis loud voice and stern expression as he said this made the\\nclerks gathered in the outer office start with alarm, but by the\\ntime they had weighed the significance of his words, his car was\\nalready purring majestically out through the main gate to a\\nchorus of derisive jeers from a knot of women standing just\\noutside.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh immediately called a meeting of Mo Kan-cheng\\nand three or four of his immediate subordinates, including Kuei\\nChang-lin. The news that Wu Sun-fu’s patience was at an end,\\nand that he had made the next day the deadline for a settlement,\\nsoon spread through the whole factory. The supervisors and\\nforewomen took this to mean that Wu Sun-fu was intending to\\nresort to more forceful methods. This was a matter of great ex-\\ncitement for them, for they knew very well that if he abandoned\\nhis policy of “peaceful settlement” for one of compulsion, it\\nwould mean the end, or at least the decline, of the Tu Wei-\\nyueh régime. Although they did not dare protest openly against\\nTu Wei-yueh’s rule, they were not at all happy about it.\\n\\nKnowing perfectly well what was going on in their minds,\\nTu Wei-yueh made a point of telling them first of all that Wu\\n\\nSun-fu was not at all satisfied with Chien Pao-sheng and Kuei\\nChang-lin. Then he broached the main subject of the meeting:\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Wu has ordered three things: double pay on the\\nday of the festival, the dismissal of Yao Chin-feng, and the pro-\\nmotion of Hsueh Pao-chu to the rank of supervisor.”\\n\\nThis announcement was met with incredulous stares from\\neveryone and a passionate protest from Kuei Chang-lin. “Why,\\nthat’s kicking a man when he’s down! It’s not fair! And what’s\\nHsueh Pao-chu done that she should be promoted?”\\n\\n“It’s not fair on Yao Chin-feng!” broke in Wang Chin-chen,\\none of the forewomen. “You ought to have stuck up for her,\\nMr. Tu, instead of letting her down like this. You told me to\\nmake up to her, and now she’s got the sack and Hsueh Pao-chu,\\nthe one who\\'s been asking for trouble, has been promoted: what\\nsense is there in that?”\\n\\nIndignant as she was at the apparent injustice of it all, she\\nhardly dared blame it on to Wu Sun-fu, on whose favours she\\nbattened, but had to restrict herself to taking it out on Tu Wei-\\nyueh.\\n\\nThe latter, however, declined to answer: he just squared his\\nshoulders and smiled calmly.\\n\\n“Mr. Wu accuses me of not being able to get on with Chien\\nPao-sheng. All right: I admit it. We are enemies. We\\'re both\\nin the union for a living, but he wants to hog the lot, so of\\ncourse I have to fight against him. If Mr. Wu doesn’t care who\\'s\\nfighting who in the union, and if he’s only interested in clearing\\nup the trouble with the women, then why does he have to\\ngo and promote Hsueh Pao-chu? She’s trying to throw a spanner\\nin the works and it’s Chien Pao-sheng who’s behind her egging\\nher on. He’s jealous of me, and he’s always having a £0 at\\nme. Everybody knows that.”\\n\\nAs he delivered himself of this long tirade against his rival,\\nKuei Chang-lin’s eyes flashed and he almost foamed at the mouth\\nwith excitement, though he adopted a more moderate tone in his\\nreferences to Wu Sun-fu, because, of all those present, he him-\\nself was the only one from the union and was dependent only\\non the union for a living, whereas all the others depended on\\ntheir employer for their livelihood and naturally did not dare\\n\\ncriticize Wu Sun-fu’s way of doing things in front of Tu Wei-\\nyueh,\\n\\nAgain Tu Wei-yueh smiled nonchalantly and remained silent.\\nMo Kan-cheng said, “Of course, if that’s the way Mr. Wu Sun-\\nfu wants it, we’ll just have to do it that way. But, Mr. Tu, if\\nwe\\'ve got to clear up the trouble today, what are we going to\\ndo about it?”\\n\\n“That’s what we’re going to discuss now,” replied Tu Wei-\\nyueh. He flashed a glance at one of the supervisors, Pockmarked\\nLi, and one of the forewomen, just as they were smiling at him.\\nThey had been Tu Wei-yueh’s new favourites ever since he\\n“came to power.” He squared his shoulders, glanced rapidly\\nround the circle of faces, and began in a loud voice:\\n\\n“Let’s leave the question of Yao Chin-feng and Hsueh Pao-chu\\nout of it for the moment. Mr. Wu has always been a very fair\\nman, and I can give you my word for it that he won’t let any-\\none down who’s really put their back into it and has his in-\\nterests at heart. He says that this trouble must definitely be\\ncleared up by today, and he’s promised double pay over the\\nfestival. The only thing that worries me now is that some of\\nthe hard cases like Ho Hsiu-mei might kick up rough and spoil\\nthe whole show. We must be tough with them and stand no\\nnonsense. Li, I’ll leave that to you. Just put the wind up them;\\nthat’ll be enough —”\\n\\n“Just leave it to me!” said Pockmarked Li eagerly, his bushy\\neyebrows twitching with glee. He was a member of the under-\\nworld, and at any time he could call up a dozen of “the boys”\\nfor a fight.\\n\\n“Put the wind up them?” cried one of the forewomen, Wang\\nChin-chen, scornfully. “That’s not going to be as easy as you\\nthink! You\\'ll find you’ve got a job on scaring Ho Hsiu-mei and\\nher lot — you\\'ll find them tougher than you bargained for?”\\n\\nPockmarked Li glared indignantly and was just going to argue\\nabout it when Tu Wei-yueh restrained him.\\n\\n“Wang Chin-chen’s right, you know, Li. The best thing you\\ncan do is to get hold of Ho Hsiu-mei when you get the chance,\\nand cart her off to the theatre. She’s out at lunch just now, so\\nyou\\'d better get a move on and get the job done — and mind you\\ndon’t make a hash of it. If you haven’t had your lunch yet, you’d\\n\\nbetter get ten dollars from the cashier so that you can treat your\\nmates to a meal when they’ve finished the job. — And remember:\\nall this has got to be kept quiet!”\\n\\n“Kept quiet?” muttered Kuei Chang-lin sarcastically. “You\\ncan’t trust those two so-and-sos Chien Pao-sheng and Hsueh\\nPao-chu to keep it quiet—but then sometimes it pays not to keep\\nthings quiet!”\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng gave Pockmarked Li his ten dollars, and the\\nlatter departed weil pleased with himself. Tu Wei-yueh gave\\nKuei Chang-lin a hard look, but did not say anything, then\\nturned and asked one of the forewomen, “How did you get on,\\nAh-chen?”\\n\\n“Well, about half of the women think that Yao Chin-feng’s\\nin the right. They say Hsueh Pao-chu’s a capitalist stooge and\\nthat she’s been spreading rumours just to get Yao Chin-feng\\ninto trouble. And they say that Ho Hsiu-mei is jealous of Yao\\nChin-feng and wants to push herself forward.”\\n\\n“Well done! Now, Ho Hsiu-mei won’t be coming in to work\\nthis afternoon, so I want you to put it round that Mr. Mo’s taken\\nher to the theatre —”\\n\\n“What, me?” protested Mo Kan-cheng hastily. “Now, look\\nhere, old man, don’t go dragging me into all this!”\\n\\nKuei Chang-lin, Wang Chin-chen and Ah-chen laughed, but\\nTu Wei-yueh kept a straight face and patted Mo Kan-cheng re-\\nassuringly on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Of course it’s you who\\'ll have to take her to the theatre,”\\nhe assured him. “And now you must go and find Pockmarked\\nLi— you\\'ll find him somewhere around Ho Hsiu-mei’s place—\\nand arrange to come on the scene and rescue her when Li’s boys\\nhave lured her away to some out-of-the-way spot. Then all you\\nhave to do is to invite her to the theatre.”\\n\\n“And what if she refuses?”\\n\\n“Then you\\'ll have to use your head. Tell her you\\'re just\\ntaking her into the theatre to hide until the wolves have cleared\\noff. You’re an old man, so she won\\'t suspect you, and she’s\\nsure to do as you suggest.”\\n\\n“And what if Mr. Wu gets to hear of it? There\\'ll be hell\\nto pay!”\\n\\n“Don’t you worry about that: I\\'ll do any explaining that needs\\nto be done. Off you go, then! And now, Ah-chen, you run\\nalong and do your bit—and mind you don’t let the cat out of\\nthe bag!”\\n\\nAfter they had gone, there were only three people left in\\nthe room: Tu Wei-yueh, Kuei Chang-lin and Wang Chin-chen.\\nWith a wry smile, Tu Wei-yueh fixed his keen gaze on Kuei\\nChang-lin’s face: the face of a man nearing forty, square, with\\nsmall eyes that did not quite match, and with a rather vil-\\nlainous cast to its features, which showed increasing signs of\\nuneasiness beneath Tu Wei-yueh’s piercing gaze.\\n\\nSuddenly Tu Wei-yueh laughed, then asked coldly, “Chang-\\nlin, do you really mean to go on being at daggers drawn with\\nChien Pao-sheng?”\\n\\nInstead of answering, Kuei Chang-lin shook himself, put his\\nhands on his hips, and glared at Tu Wei-yueh.\\n\\n“Come now, what chance have you got against a man with his\\npull?”\\n\\n“Huh! Pull? He’s got damn-all pull! He’s nothing more than\\na high official’s lap-dog.”\\n\\n“Exactly, but that’s just where you lose. Your Mr. Wang\\nChing-wei’s away in Hongkong.”\\n\\nKuei Chang-lin’s face fell, and the aggressive glint in his eye\\ngave way to a look of fear and uncertainty.\\n\\n“You needn’t worry, though. There’s only Wang Chin-chen\\nhere, and she’s a good friend of yours. I can tell you quite\\nfrankly that Mr. Wu Sun-fu keeps in touch with friends of\\nMr. Wang Ching-wei, so, when you come to think of it, you and\\nMr. Wu Sun-fu are in the swim together, as it were. So you\\nought to be willing to do your best for Mr. Wu Sun-fu in factory\\naffairs. Am I right?”\\n\\n“If Mr. Wu Sun-fu knows everything about me, then why\\nshould he have given Yao Chin-feng the sack and promoted\\nHsueh Pao-chu? And besides, I’ve done my best for him all\\nthrough this trouble, haven’t 1? I’d like to ask him that to his\\nface and see what he says!”\\n\\n“Mr. Wu isn’t playing the game,” interposed Wang Chin-chen.\\n“Mr. Tu, why don’t you have a word with Mr. Wu about it\\nbefore you put up the notice?”\\n\\nShe thought she was being very tactful in supporting Kuei\\nChang-lin and at the same time hinting at the Tu Wei-yueh’s\\ninfluential position, but, to her surprise, Tu Wei-yueh frowned and\\nsnapped at her:\\n\\n“You can leave Mr. Wu out of it! He’s too busy to bother him-\\nself about such trifles. I, Tu Wei-yueh, am responsible here.\\nWhen I say to him that Yao Chin-feng should be fired and Hsueh\\nPao-chu promoted, he just nods his head, and what I say goes.”\\n\\n“Then you’ve done Yao Chin-feng an injustice on your own\\nresponsibility!” cried Kuei Chang-lin, springing up and shaking\\nhis fist. Wang Chin-chen pulled him back by the hem of his\\ncoat. Tu Wei-yueh threw back his head and laughed as if he\\nhad not seen the ham-like fist being brandished under his nose.\\nThe fist was withdrawn automatically when it came within a\\nfew inches of his face, and a venomous humph was heard. Tu\\nWei-yueh had stopped laughing and his face was as calm and\\nexpressionless as ever.\\n\\n“Pah!” he suddenly spat out. ‘You fool! It’s all too com-\\nplicated for your thick head! Can’t you imagine how the women\\nwill react when they hear that Hsueh Pao-chu’s been promoted\\nand Yao Chin-feng discharged? They’ll suspect Hsueh Pao-chu\\nand support Yao Chin-feng again —”\\n\\n“But how can they support her when she’s been sacked?”\\n\\n“Chang-lin, please... why can’t you stop and think before you\\nspeak? Haven\\'t I told you Mr. Wu Sun-fu’ll play fair with every-\\nbody in the long run? It won’t do any good standing here\\ngrumbling: you’d be better employed working on the women. As\\nfor Chien Pao-sheng, I’ll teach him a lesson yet, and in public\\ntoo, one of these days. And remember, both of you, that I’m\\non your side. I give you my word for it. Understand? Off\\nyou go, then.”\\n\\nHaving dismissed them, Tu Wei-yueh took a piece of paper\\nand began wording the notice.\\n\\nThe hooter blared its summons from one end of the factory\\nto the other, and the women streamed into the workshops. The\\nbuzz of voices began to swell in to a tide, but this time the tide\\nwas to flow through a channel which had been engineered by\\nTu Wei-yueh.\\n\\nWhen he left the factory Wu Sun-fu had gone straight to the\\nBankers’ Club. Except for Sundays, he usually lunched here,\\nfor here he could meet his friends in a cheerful atmosphere, and\\nsit around chatting for an hour or so. But today, as he stepped\\ninto the well appointed dining-room, he was struck by the\\nabsence of the usual warm and cheerful atmosphere. He was\\nnot met by the smiles and jovial greetings of his cronies. The\\nfew people there were all strangers, and their talk, mingled with\\nthe clatter of knives and forks, was either about the war or about\\ndancing girls and dog racing. They seemed to have nothing bet-\\nter to talk about; they were just trying to kill time while they\\nate. At a table under the windows sat three middle-aged men\\nwhose chubby faces, beaming with complacency, suggested that\\nthey had lived a comfortable and idle life in the country as rich\\nlandlords and usurers. They sat with their heads together con-\\nferring in whispers. Wu Sun-fu chose a place facing them,\\ntwo or three tables away.\\n\\nOutside the windows everything was still obscured by the\\nthick, misty drizzle, so that one might have imagined that the\\nprosperous industrial city of Shanghai had disappeared from the\\nface of the earth, leaving only this dining-room with its half-\\na-dozen young bloods talking listlessly about dancing girls and\\ngreyhound racing, its three feudal landlords, and its industrialist,\\nWu Sun-fu, worrying about his battles on the three fronts.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu sighed dejectedly and ordered a brandy. When it\\ncame, he sipped at it nervously.\\n\\nThere was no denying it: he was between three fires; and there\\nwas no denying that he had been fighting back as hard as he\\ncould. At a moment like this, when his fate was still in the\\nbalance, it was futile for him to start thinking about how he\\nshould advance if he won, and he was too distraught to plan a\\nwithdrawal or counter-attack in case he was defeated. In any\\nease, he did not know where to start in his planning for the\\nfuture, since he had no idea what the extent of his losses would\\nbe. All he could do for the moment was to drown his sorrows\\nin his brandy. He felt rather like a prisoner waiting in the\\ncondemned cell.\\n\\nThe brandy picked him up somewhat —or at least, it restored\\nhis usual quickness of hearing. One of the three whisperers\\n\\nspoke a little more distinctly than the other two, and Wu Sun-\\nfu clearly overheard a snatch of conversation which made him\\nsit up.\\n\\n“Now that we’ve gone as far as this, we must either go the\\nwhole hog or else drop it altogether. I’m in favour of putting\\nup a fight, myself. All this talk about a victory by the Central\\nArmy is just a rumour put about by the bulls. You know that\\nfellow Chao? Well, he’s one of the big bulls and he’s rigging\\nthe market. Though I don’t believe he’s so keen on pushing up\\nthe prices just now that we need worry about him.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu could see the speaker in profile—a long, narrow\\nface with a wispy, drooping moustache. His companions were\\nlistening in silence, one of them resting his chin on his upturned\\npalm and holding a coffee-cup in the other hand as he gazed\\nthoughtfully into space. After a brief pause they both began\\nspeaking at the same time, but their voices were so low and in-\\ndistinct that it was only from their expressions that one could\\ntell that they were arguing with the man with the moustache.\\nThey were obviously speculators in government bonds, and\\nbears at that.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu glanced at his watch and saw that it was already\\nten minutes to one. Newcomers arrived from time to time, but\\ncuriously enough there was not a single familiar face among\\nthem. He fiddled abstractedly with his knife and fork as he\\nturned over in his mind the remarks the man with the moustache\\nhad just made. Could it be that they represented the trend of\\nthought among the bears as a whole? It was hard for him to\\nsay. But obviously the market was still in a state of flux, and a\\nlife and death struggle was going on there. Perhaps this was\\nthe reason why he had not met a single acquaintance here to-\\nday. Anyway, there was no point in hanging about here. He\\npushed aside his plate and was just going to get up, when he\\nsaw two familiar faces: Han Meng-hsiang and Li Yu-ting, the\\nformer being a stockbroker and a close friend of Chao Po-tao.\\n\\nSeeing Wu Sun-fu there, Han Meng-hsiang smiled to him and\\ncame across.\\n\\n“Both sides are holding out as long as they can,” he whispered.\\n“Chao Po-tao’s furious.”\\n\\n“What! — Furious, is he?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was taken off his guard for a moment, but quickly\\nrecovered his composure, so that his question sounded off-handed\\nenough not to rouse the other\\'s suspicions.\\n\\n“Chao Po-tao doesn’t go for small fry,” said Han Meng-hsiang\\nquietly, smiling and glancing round at Li Yu-ting. “He goes\\nwhaling. It’s all or nothing with him! Wait until the after-\\nnoon session opens at two, and then you’ll see!”\\n\\nJust then, one of the three men at the other table, a pale,\\ncorpulent little man, bobbed up and called across, “Mr. Han\\nMeng-hsiang!” His two companions were still engrossed in\\ntheir téte-a4-téte. Han Meng-hsiang nodded to Wu Sun-fu and\\nwent across to join the others. An animated conversation\\nensued — doubtless about the day’s events on the Stock Ex-\\nchange.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu now invited Li Yu-ting to join him for lunch, and\\nthey chatted for a while about this and that. Wu Sun-fu, his\\nface flushed with the wine, suddenly brought up the subject of\\nChang Su-su.\\n\\n“My wife was telling me the other day that you and Su-su\\nhave had a bit of a tiff.”\\n\\n“Oh, we’ve never been serious about it~—not enough to have\\na tiff, anyway!”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting sounded rather embarrassed as he replied. Re-\\nmembering the way Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-sheng had ragged\\nhim, he felt more uncomfortable still, But Wu Sun-fu did not\\nseem to notice his embarrassment. Gulping down a large\\nmouthful of lemonade, he continued cheerfully:\\n\\n“You know, Su-su’s lively and independent like her father\\nand clever and sharp like her mother. I think she’d be too much\\nof a handful for you, Yu-ting!”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting’s only reply was a wry smile as he bent his head\\nto tackle the leg of chicken before him.\\n\\nA boisterous laugh came from Han Meng-hsiang at the other\\ntable, followed by a noisy, heated argument between the four of\\nthem. A deep voice boomed above the babel: “All you’ve got\\nto do, Yun-ching, is to chase up your tenants for a bit more\\nrent, and there you are!”\\n\\nThe man with the moustache shook his long head and said\\nmournfully, “No, that’s no good. It’s been a bad year, and every-\\n\\nwhere the peasants are rioting and refusing to pay their rents.”\\n\\nAt this the babel of voices broke loose again.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu knit his brows in a frown, covered his wineglass\\nwith his hand, and asked, “What’s the news? Anything special?”\\n\\n“T hear there’s a big scheme afoot,” Li Yu-ting replied casually,\\nlaying down his knife and fork and wiping his mouth with\\nhis napkin. “And it happens to concern you, too.”\\n\\n“A big scheme that concerns me?” returned Wu Sun-fu in an\\nequally casual tone, putting on a light-hearted smile. “Well, I\\nhaven\\'t heard anything about it!”\\n\\nHe assumed Li Yu-ting was referring to the trust company.\\nAfter all, it was no secret, really, though he was a little irked\\nat the speed with which the news had spread. As it turned out,\\nhowever, he was in for a shock.\\n\\n“It’s not what you’re thinking, though,” Li Yu-ting went on.\\n“you\\'re not one of those who are launching the scheme: you\\'re\\none of the people it’s aimed at. That’s what I meant when I\\nsaid it concerns you. I should have thought you would have\\nheard about it already.”\\n\\n“Oh... no, I haven’t heard a thing. Honestly I haven\\'t.”\\n\\n“Ti’s too early yet to be able to say whether they’re going\\nto go through with it, but I have heard that they’re quite set\\non the idea. Well, to cut a long story short, some finance capi-\\ntalists are planning to take over certain industries. They’re\\ntaking their cue from American financiers who have got control\\nof industry.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu half closed his eyes and gently shook his head.\\n\\n“you don’t think they can do it?” pursued Li Yu-ting. “Don’t\\nforget the Shanghai bankers made a total profit of two hundred\\nmillion dollars last year, and now, of course, they’re looking for\\nsomething to invest all this surplus capital in.”\\n\\n“The obvious thing to do with it,” retorted Wu Sun-fu con-\\ntemptuously, “is to put it into the government stock market, or\\nelse real estate or building. They wouldn’t dream of looking\\nbeyond investments like that.”\\n\\nHis face was flushed with drinking, and his self-confidence\\nwas probably inspired by the fact that he was becoming slightly\\ntipsy. His companion, who had also been imbibing freely, was\\nwaxing eloquent, and was not to be gainsaid.\\n\\n“I’m afraid you’re underestimating them, Sun-fu. They’re\\nreally set on this scheme, even though they haven’t got the\\nfoundations solidly laid so far. You can’t afford to ignore them,\\nthough, even at this early stage—especially when a number\\nof American financiers are backing their scheme. I hear the\\nfirst thing they’re planning to do is to get the government to\\nissue a vast number of industrial bonds, so that they can buy\\nthem up and gradually gain control over industry on the pre-\\ntence of aiding it. But this\\'ll be only the beginning of the control\\nof industrial capital by financial capital: the possibilities of a fur-\\nther—”\\n\\n“But the government won’t issue enough bonds to meet their\\nmilitary expenses, let alone start financing industrial construc-\\ntion!”\\n\\n“That’s true at the moment, but then the war’s still on. What\\nthese people are hoping is that the war will end with a govern-\\nment victory and that the whole country will become united.\\nAnd of course their American friends hope so, too. So far as\\nI can see, their wishes look like coming true; and I bet when that\\nhappens you won’t be saying that their scheme is just a lot of\\nwishful thinking! How can you possibly say that they can’t put\\nit through, considering all the American experience and dollars\\nthey’ll have behind them? Listen, Sun-fu, you know the way\\nit goes in. Western countries: financial capital’s swallowing in-\\ndustrial capital all the time. Well, just think. how much worse\\nit will be in China, where industry’s still in its infancy—and not\\na very flourishing one at that— and where the American dollar\\nis always looking for a chance to get a foothold—”\\n\\n“But that’d be throwing our national industry to the wolves!”\\nWu Sun-fu suddenly interrupted through clenched teeth. His\\ntipsiness had worn off and left his face pale and his eyes blood-\\nshot. .He could no longer even muster up his usual cool, con-\\ntemptuous smile. His sudden indignation came as a surprise to\\nLi Yu-ting, who promptly fell silent for a while, then, as if to\\nease the tense atmosphere, muttered to himself:\\n\\n“On the other hand, the scheme may fizzle out. After all,\\nAmerica still doesn’t have all her own way in the world, especial-\\nly in the East, where she has two serious rivals.”\\n\\n“pngland and Japan, do you mean?” asked Wu Sun-fu, gazing\\nblankly out of the window. Then, without conviction: “Yes,\\nwell, perhaps when the war’s over things may not pan out just\\nas the financiers are hoping they will.”\\n\\nHis brain was in a whirl just at the moment. His righteous\\nindignation at the fate of China’s national industries was be-\\nginning to cool down and make way for apprehension about his\\nown personal interests; and this apprehension became more and\\nmore insistent, until he could think of nothing else. Li Yu-ting\\nwas right, of course, when he said China’s industry was based\\non a very shaky foundation. As for the weakest going to the\\nwall, well, that’s just what was happening among the Chinese\\nindustrialists themselves: wasn’t he himself scheming to swallow\\nup Chu Yin-chiu, who was weaker than he was? And now he\\nhimself was in danger of being swallowed up—just when he was\\nalready in the middle of three decisive battles, too. The more\\nhe thought about it all, the worse he felt.\\n\\nHis despondent reverie was suddenly interrupted by someone\\ncalling his name. He looked up to see Han Meng-hsiang, look-\\ning very pleased with himself, raise his hand to bid him good-\\nbye, then hurry out with his three companions in tow, the one\\nwith the moustache unhurriedly bringing up the rear. ,\\n\\n“Off to the Exchange, I suppose,” said Li Yu-ting in low, rather\\nmournful tones as he gazed at their retreating figures and then\\nglanced back at his companion. “Phe Exchange today is just\\nlike a battlefield.”\\n\\nThe waiter served their coffee. Wu Sun-fu took a sip at his,\\nthen put down his cup and asked Li Yu-ting, “It seems, then, that\\nthe people behind this scheme are American financiers; but who\\nhave they got helping them here? Whoever they are, they’re\\nletting the wolf into the fold!”\\n\\n“They say Shang Chung-li and Chao Po-tao are among them,”\\nsaid Li Yu-ting off-handedly, engrossed in his coffee. Wu Sun-\\nfu’s expression changed in a flash to one of dismay: so it was\\nChao Po-tao again, eh? I’ve been taken in properly this time,\\nhe thought, and this “bull company” idea is just a trap. He\\nsnorted, but made no comment. His mortification, however,\\nquickly evaporated and gave way to anger and thoughts of re-\\nvenge; now that he had accepted defeat as inevitable, he became\\n\\nstrangely calm and his courage began to return. All he wanted\\nnow was to ascertain the full extent of his losses, so that he\\ncould begin to salvage what he could from the wreckage and\\nplan a counter-attack at the first opportunity.\\n\\nAfter he had taken his leave of Li Yu-ting, Wu Sun-fu drove\\nstraight home. As he sat in the car, the thoughts raced through\\nhis head like the wheels beneath him as once again he carefully\\nturned over in his mind all that he had just learnt from Li Yu-\\nting. He tried to comfort himself with the thought that perhaps,\\nafter all, the scheme might not prove practicable —it might not\\nexist, even. It was probably just a wild idea of Chao Po-tao’s,\\nreinforced by American bourgeois megalomania. Hadn’t some\\nEuropean scholar once said that after the Great War this\\nmegalomania of the American bourgeoisie had developed out all\\nproportion? And hadn’t the world depression also struck the\\nUnited States?. .. But then they’d had Dawes and Young. Yes,\\nthe United States might be preparing a second Dawes Plan for\\nChina. As soon as the war was over and the country had a\\nunified government, it would fall pat into the hands of the\\nYankee, and a second Dawes Plan would come into operation.\\nAh, but what about the other two Powers in the East?—If this\\nhappened, their interests would be threatened and the three of\\nthem might come to blows! The thought brought a sardonic\\nsmile to Wu Sun-fu’s lips. It was at this point in his musings\\nthat the car turned in at his front gate and swished up the drive.\\n\\nAnother shower greeted him as he got out of the car. The\\novercast sky shrouded the garden in a twilight gloom, and in-\\ndoors all the lights were on. In the big drawing-room he found\\nhis wife, his sister Huei-fang and Tu Hsin-to. He stopped for\\na few words with them, then hurried off to his study. He did\\nnot relish the idea of having people see him when he was upset;\\nand besides, he had a pile of correspondence to deal with.\\n\\nHe got a number of routine business letters out of the way\\nfirst, then turned his attention to a long letter from a friend in\\nWusih who owned a cotton mill and was anxious that Wu Sun-\\nfu should take up some of the new shares he was issuing to\\nenable him to increase the number of spindles in his factory. The\\nrequest had come just at the wrong moment, and as he scribbled\\na reply, his ili-humour seemed to find expression in his wording,\\n\\nso that when he went through it afterwards he was amazed\\nthat he could have written such a peevishly worded letter. He\\ntore it up and, hardly feeling in a mood to rewrite it, went back\\ninto the drawing-room.\\n\\nWhen he walked in, Lin Pei-shan was playing a dismal tune\\non the piano, while the yellow lamp-light, as dismal as the music,\\nfell on her slender figure, which was sheathed in deep-blue\\nsilk. Wu Sun-fu frowned and was just going to say something,\\nwhen he heard a sigh. His frown deepened as he looked round\\nto see his wife sitting there, her eyes red with weeping and her\\ncheeks still wet. Her sigh was echoed by a lugubrious utterance\\nfrom Tu Hsin-to.\\n\\n“Life is like the morning dew! And that’s just the mood that\\nthis tune expresses. It’s just the right tune to play on such a\\ndark, rainy day as this, in this dreamy lamp-light.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s face darkened at these ominous words, and an\\noverpowering sense of foreboding clutched at his heart like a\\nsteel claw. He was about to give vent to his fury, when the\\nbutler, Kao Sheng, came in with a message that made his heart\\nmiss a beat.\\n\\n“You’re wanted on the phone, sir. It’s the factory.” Wu Sun-\\nfu spun round and hurried out. So they’d rung through at last!\\nBut which was it to be—success or disaster? His hand trembled\\nin spite of himself as he picked up the receiver. A brief pause,\\nthen his face lit up with relief as he answered in a clear, cheer-\\nful voice:\\n\\n“Well done!... All right, if you insist: two weeks’ double pay\\nfor Kuei Chang-lin. See you at nine in the morning.”\\n\\nThe trouble at the factory was ended, and victory was his.\\nThere was no need for him to worry about the “home front”\\nany longer.\\n\\nHe replaced the receiver with a smile. By now the shower had\\npassed, and a shaft of golden sunlight streamed in through the\\nwindow from the west. Outside the window, the trees in the\\ngarden were a vivid green and seemed to be dripping rhythmi-\\ncally. Light of heart and step, Wu Sun-fu went along a veranda\\nand out into the rain-washed garden. Strolling along the drive,\\nhe felt that the air had never been so fresh before. As he ap-\\nproached the front door, he heard the furious blare of a horn,\\n\\nand a car raced up the drive. It had hardly stopped before\\nthe house, when Tu Chu-chai scrambled out. It was not like\\nhim to be in such a tearing hurry!\\n\\n“What’s happened, Chu-chai?” asked Wu Sun-fu as he hurried\\nacross to the car in a torment of suspense. But he did not need\\nto wait for a reply to know that they had won, for Tu Chu-\\nchai’s goat-like face, care-worn as it was, beamed with undis-\\nguised satisfaction. As they went up the steps together, Tu Chu-\\nchai told him in a triumphant whisper:\\n\\n“All the bears made a last-minute rush to cover in the after-\\nnoon session; the rise was terrific and almost reached the limit\\nand caused trading to close. If we’d bought in two or three\\nmillion more, we could easily have got rid of them today. Pity\\nwe were too cautious! Our present position—”\\n\\n“Skip it,” smiled Wu Sun-fu, “we’ve done well enough for a\\nstart pulling this little lot off. There’s always time to go into\\nit in a big way later on.”\\n\\nThe setting sun shone full on his face, lighting it up with a rosy\\nglow. The dismal look which had been lurking in his eyes all\\nday had quite vanished. The siege was broken, and two of his\\nthree big battles were won. As for the great scheme—the great\\nplot, if you will—which Li Yu-ting had told him about, it held\\nno terrors for him now as he basked in the glow of his victories.\\nVill\\n\\nT HE last-minute rise in government-issue quotations had taken\\nmany indiscriminate speculators by surprise, and they had crashed\\nbadly. Among their number were the three men Wu Sun-fu had\\nseen that day when he dined at the Bankers’ Club; the worst hit\\nof the three was Feng Yun-ching, the fiftyish man with the long\\nface and the drooping moustache.\\n\\nUntil six months ago, this Feng Yun-ching had enjoyed an idle,\\ncomfortable life down in the country. Back in the time of the\\nManchu dynasty he had passed the preliminary official ex-\\naminations, but had got no further and so had not qualified to\\ntake his place among the “gentry,” who had charge of local af-\\nfairs. Failing in this ambition, hc had diverted his energies into\\nother channels—exploitation of the peasantry as a usurious\\nmoney-lender. As it turned out, this second course proved\\nequally rewarding, for it yielded him a fair amount of property.\\nWhen he made his “countryside loans” to local peasants, he did\\nnot insist on cash repayments, nor did he press for prompt cash\\nsettlements of his loans, which at the end of six months had\\nearned him interest equal to the original loan: no, what he was\\ninterested in was to let a loan grow until he could foreclose the\\npeasant of his mortgaged land. He had a genius for making a\\nfive- or ten-dollar Joan and letting it bring him in an acre or two\\nof land at the end of two years. This was, of course, quite a\\ncommon method among the landlords up country, but Feng Yun-\\nching, “The Smiling Tiger,” distinguished himself by his skill\\nin giving his debtors just enough rope to hang themselves with.\\nLike the spidet that spins its web and waits patiently for its\\nprey, he cast his nets with care, and when his victim found him-\\nself with a debt he could not repay—it might be as little as a\\ndollar—he would invariably end up by forfeiting his land to\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching. Then, when his land was gone, he would be\\nforced to become a mere tenant working on his land, and as\\nsuch he would be no more than a slave, a beast of burden. Five\\nyears ago, he had already amassed about four hundred acres\\nby this means, using every shift of deceit and guile, just half an\\nacre or an acre at a time; and every acre wet with the sweat\\nand tears of the dispossessed peasant. And so it was that, from\\nthe wrecked lives of hundreds of peasants, Feng Yun-ching had\\nbeen able to win himself a life of luxury and dissipation. Be-\\nfore long, he contrived to worm his way into local political cir-\\ncles, where his extended influence enabled him to cast his net\\nof usury wider and exert greater pressure on his peasant victims,\\nso that, within the short space of two years, he managed to add\\ntwo hundred acres or so to his holdings. By this time, however,\\nhis newly acquired concubine, Chiu, on whom he doted, began\\nto spend his money for him with remarkable liberality. Nor\\nwas this all: the possession of a vivacious young concubine\\nwas a drain on his energy. The effect of all this made itself felt\\nwhen rioting broke out among the peasantry and swarms of\\nbandits made their appearance: Feng Yun-ching’s accustomed\\nboldness and imperturbability deserted him, and he collected up\\nall his ready cash and removed himself and his family to Shang-\\nhai—partly for fear of the peasants and bandits, and partly be-\\ncause his concubine Chiu wished it.\\n\\nNow, though a respectable citizen of Shanghai, he did not\\nlike the idea of living on his uninvested capital. He had well\\nover five hundred acres of land, it is true, and a certain amount\\nof rent was forthcoming, but in these troubled times there was\\nno guarantee that he would be able to collect his usual sixty per\\ncent of his tenants’ farm produce as he had in days past. He\\nhad brought some eighty thousand dollars in cash with him, but\\nthis was not enough to qualify him as a money-lender in a city\\nlike Shanghai. If he put the money in a bank, the rate of in-\\nterest was too low to meet his current household expenses, which\\ncame to nearly a thousand dollars a month if one included his\\nconcubine’s opium money. It was a problem requiring very care-\\nful thought. Fortunately, the government had issued large\\nquantities of different kinds of bonds, and the armed clashes\\nbetween the warlords, which dragged on from year to year, had\\n\\nkept the stock market in a state of flux and provided a con-\\nstant excellent opportunity for speculation. Feng Yun-ching,\\nwith his eighty thousand dollars, had therefore plunged into the\\nstock market. His luck had held for six months running, his\\nmonthly profit being a good two and a half per cent. He had\\nalmost begun to call himself a “stock expert.” And now he had\\nsuffered this shattering blow. He could hardly believe it.\\n\\nWhen he came to reckon up his losses, he found he had really\\ncome to grief: his deposit of fifty thousand dollars in the Ex-\\nchange was all gone, and he owed thirty thousand more, which\\nhe would have to pay within three days—his broker, Han Meng-\\nhsiang, had been in once already to press for payment. Ever\\nsince he had got up at half past eleven that morning, Feng Yun-\\nching had been hard at work with an abacus. It was now two\\no’clock in the afternoon and he had not had a bite of food; and\\nstill he could not find a way to make ends meet. What grieved\\nhim most was that he could see no way of winning back his\\nmoney.\\n\\nSunlight was streaming through the bamboo blinds and throw-\\ning a criss-cross pattern of light and shade over part of the room.\\nAt the slightest breeze the blinds gently swayed, and this filigree\\nof shadows rippled over the chairs and tables in a black and\\nwhite fantasy. Sitting at a square mahogany table under the\\nwindow, Feng Yun-ching was turning the pages of an account-\\nbook with his right hand and holding a cigarette in his left. As\\nthe shadows danced across the pages of his book, the columns\\nof figures seemed to dance with them, much to his annoyance.\\nBringing his palm down on the book with an impatient thwack,\\nhe left his seat and paced through into the rear part of the\\nhouse, where he lay down on a mahogany couch and closed his\\neyes with a sigh. Until yesterday he had been a rich man: to-\\nday he was not only penniless, but tens of thousands of dollars\\nin debt! Was it his own fault? No; that was something he\\nwould never admit! “It’s just my bad luck,” he told himself with\\nanother sigh. Yet why should his luck, which had stood him\\nin good stead these twenty years and more, suddenly desert him\\nnow? He was knitting his brows in search of an answer, when\\nsuddenly something fell with a heavy thud on the floor above\\nhim, and he sat up with a nervous start. Then the electric bell\\n\\nin the servants’ quarters began ringing, and continued to ring\\nfor fully three minutes. It was his concubine ringing for the\\nmaid after waking up—the night before, she had not come home\\nuntil dawn. This was now her usual custom, and Feng Yun-\\nching had long resigned himself to it; but today when he had\\njust found himself bankrupt, it annoyed him, and it suddenly\\noccurred to him that there must be some connection between his\\nbad luck and her bad behaviour: who had ever heard of a be-\\ntrayed husband being lucky?\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching stood up and started towards the door, but\\nchanged his mind and turned round again, his straggly moustache\\ntwitching agitatedly. He had half a mind to go up and tell her\\nto her face to behave herself, but he thought better of it and\\nstayed where he was: he remembered in time that concubines\\nof her category could be dangerous when roused. He swallowed\\nhis anger and turned his eyes vacantly on the Marxims for Keep-\\ning Order in a Family inscribed on a scroll hanging on the\\nwall above the couch. He stared at it glumly, and soon became\\nlost in thought.\\n\\nPresently there came the click of high-heeled shoes as foot-\\nsteps approached and suddenly stopped outside the door. The\\ndoor was flung open, and a girl of about eighteen fluttered into\\nthe room. Her face was a shade too long and narrow, but this\\nshortcoming was amply compensated by an attractive mouth,\\na shapely chin—neither too pointed nor too round—and long,\\nwavy hair hanging loosely over her shoulders. Her dress was\\nof light-blue patterned silk with a lining of deep yellow and long\\nside-slits which flared open as she walked, to give a glimpse of\\nher smooth, shapely thighs—a striking contrast to the high, stiff\\ncollar which hid her neck. When she saw Feng Yun-ching star-\\ning abstractedly at the scroll she paused uncertainly in the door-\\nway a moment, then giggled and went over to him, her hips\\nswaying as she walked.\\n\\n“Daddy,” she cooed, “I’m going out shopping—”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching turned round and looked at her wide-eyed.\\n\\n“Just a few little things,” she said, twisting her hips and look-\\ning down at the floor. “A hundred dollars should be enough, I\\nthink. I must go straight away.”\\n\\nSuddenly she flitted across the room, leant over the square\\ntable, and switched on the electric fan. She turned her back\\nto the wind, and wheedled, “Why don’t you use the electric fan,\\nDaddy? Look how you\\'re perspiring! Come on, it’s nice and\\ncool here... . Just a hundred dollars, Daddy!”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching shook his head regretfully, walked slowly\\nacross to her, looked at her silently for a while, then said with\\na note of determination in his voice:\\n\\n“Mei-ching, you don’t know what a setback I’ve just had in\\nthe stock market. I’m over thirty thousand dollars in debt, and\\nI can’t pay up. I can’t even settle the small accounts due at\\nthe Dragon-boat Festival. For instance, I’ve got a bill for five\\nhundred dollars from your dress-maker—”\\n\\n“But I only had a few dresses made, Daddy.”\\n\\n“Hm-—but now you’re asking for another hundred dollars:\\nwhat do you need this time? Mei-ching, you spend more money\\nthan I do!”\\n\\n“ven so, I spend much less than Chiu does!” Mei-ching re-\\ntorted, pouting out her lips. With a twist of her waist she swung\\nherself on to a sofa and looked up into her father’s face, which\\nwas creased with embarrassment and worry. Reading his mind,\\nshe pursued deliberately, “If she can spend as much as she likes,\\nwhy shouldn’t everybody else? I don’t see why I should have\\nto give in to her!”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, Mei-ching!” Feng Yun-ching urged, forcing a\\nplacating smile to his lips. “Just give me a day or two, and\\nthen I can let you have it. How’s that?”\\n\\nHis daughter did not reply, but sat twisting her handkerchief\\nand looking round at the pictures on the walls. On one wall\\nwas a combined display of Chinese and Western art: Chang\\nTa-chien’s tiger in the centre, supported on each side by two\\nWestern landscape etchings in colour representing the four\\nseasons, their gilt frames glinting in the sunlight which flickered\\non them through the bamboo blinds. As Feng Yun-ching fol-\\nlowed his daughter’s eyes to the pictures, he began turning over\\nin his mind how he could get rid of her. Suddenly he remem-\\nbered something in connection with these etchings, which he had\\nreceived as a house-warming present from one of his concubine’s\\n“sworn sisters.” She had quite a few “sworn sisters,” but this\\n\\none, the sender of the present, was no ordinary girl: she was\\nconcubine to a man with considerable influence in the underworld,\\nthe man on whom Feng Yun-ching depended for his personal\\nsafety while he was in Shanghai. In three days’ time the Dragon-\\nboat Festival would be upon them, and he had quite forgotten\\nuntil now that he would have to send his protector an expensive\\npresent to show his gratitude.\\n\\nAs he suddenly remembered that he had this important duty\\nto perform, Feng Yun-ching decided that he had no money at\\nall to spare for his daughter.\\n\\n“Mei-ching, my dear, just wait until the festival\\'s over to do\\nyour shopping. You see, I still have to send presents to several\\nimportant people. Your poor father’s really hard up just now.\\n... Just my luck to go and lose a packet in the stock market.\\nMei-ching, you’re my only daughter: do you think I\\'d refuse\\nyou anything if I could help it—?”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching could not go on, for a lump was rising in his\\nthroat. He looked up at the ceiling, and nervously stroked his\\nstraggly moustache.\\n\\nFor a few moments neither of them spoke, and the silence was\\nbroken only by the sound of the concubine clearing her throat\\nin the room above. Feng Yun-ching was worrying about his\\ndebts, while the despondent Mei-ching was despairing of ever\\ngetting her hundred dollars. It looked as if the pleasant pro-\\ngramme she had worked out for the festival would have to be\\ncancelled, so how was she going to spend the three days’ holiday?\\nShe could not just stay at home and read “eternal triangle”\\nstories. Besides, she had already made a date with a friend, so\\nhow could she back out now? In her mind’s-eye she could\\nalready see her boy friend’s disappointed and suspicious looks if\\nshe called off the holiday programme.\\n\\nThree successive rings on the bell at the gate startled Feng\\nYun-ching from his reverie. He looked out of the window and\\nsaw his rickshaw boy Ah-shun opening the gate and ushering in\\na round-faced middle-aged man in a round, black alpaca cap.\\n“Oh, here’s Ho Shen-an!” he gasped, and rose to go out to meet\\nhim; but his visitor was too quick for him, and almost im-\\nmediately appeared in the doorway and called his name, at the\\nsame time shaking his clasped hands together, with his walking-\\n\\nstick dangling between them. Doing her best to keep a straight\\nface, Mei-ching made an especially low bow in order to hide\\nher amusement, for every time she saw him in his little round\\ncap, bobbing up and down with his stick held in front of him,\\nshe just couldn’t help laughing.\\n\\n“Mei-ching, run and tell the maid to serve tea,” said Feng\\nYun-ching, then offered Ho Shen-an a seat on the couch. As\\nMei-ching tripped lightly out of the room, Ho Shen-an gazed\\nafter her. With a thoughtful twitch of his eyebrows, he turned\\nseriously to Feng Yun-ching:\\n\\n“I’m not trying to flatter you, Yun-ching, but you’ve got a\\nwonderful daughter there. You’re a lucky man.”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching took it as an ordinary compliment and smiled\\nwoodenly, wondering how his friend who had also been hit by\\nthe recent stock exchange fluctuations could be so cheerful.\\nGlancing at his own reflection in the long mirror standing in the\\ncorner of the room, he was surprised to find that he had aged\\novernight by at least ten years. A sigh broke from his lips, and\\nhe said in a low voice:\\n\\n“Han Meng-hsiang came yesterday for the money I owe the\\nExchange, but I just hadn’t got it to give him. Though I must\\nsay this for Han Meng-hsiang: he always treats his friends\\ndecently. Don’t you remember how he advised us to cover\\nwithout delay the other day when we were lunching at the club?\\nIf we’d taken any notice of him, we wouldn’t have come a crop-\\nper like this. Ah! You made a bit of a blunder this time, Shen-\\nan: your friends in the North— the Peiyang clique— have been\\nleading you up the garden path—”\\n\\n“And serve us right, too!” interrupted Ho Shen-an, with a\\nrueful grin. “They set the trap for us, and we walked right into\\nit. And as for Han Meng-hsiang being a good friend to us—hah!\\nHe’s only Chao Po-tao’s mouthpiece. They set out to trap us\\nright from the start. It was just a big conspiracy. And now\\nI’ve found out all about it.”\\n\\nHe threw the stub of his cigarette viciously into a spittoon,\\nthen picked up a cup of tea from the table and took a sip at it.\\n\\n“What do you mean, conspiracy? You\\'re not trying to tell\\nme they rigged a victory at the front as part of their trap?”\\n\\n“Why not? So it wasn’t our bad luck that did for us: it was\\nour honesty!”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching’s eyes rolled in amazement, while his straggly\\nmoustache twitched, and he broke out into a cold sweat all over.\\nThere was no reason to disbelieve what he had just been told.\\nHe had become so used to setting traps for peasants all these\\nyears that it came as rather a shock to him to find he had walked\\ninto a snare himself. He stroked his moustache agitatedly as\\nhe slowly pulled himself together, then grumbled miserably:\\n\\n“It means ... it means I’ve been slaving all these years just\\nto put money in their pockets! Shen-an, you don’t know how\\nhard it’s been for me to make what little money I had. You’d\\nbe surprised how much breath you have to waste over a mere\\nhalf acre of land. They’re a woolly-minded lot, these country\\npeople: they want loans, but they don’t want to give up their\\nfarms! Usually, I had to go to a lot of trouble with them—invite\\nthem to a tea-house, and reason patiently with them, until I\\ncould finally make them realize that I was not robbing them of\\ntheir farms, but merely trying to get back the interests on my\\nloans—you know yourself, Shen-an, how reasonable I am. For\\nexample, whenever I went down to the village to collect my rents,\\nI never took any strong-arm men with me to beat up my\\ntenants: I always used the method of gentle persuasion—though,\\nof course, I never came away with a halfpenny less than I went\\nfor! And that’s how I managed to get together a few hundred\\nacres of land. I can tell you, it wasn’t so easy for me to make\\nmoney as it was for you when you were a county magistrate.\\nYours was a soft job—you just cooked the land-tax accounts\\nand reserved yourself a percentage of the opium pool, so that\\nwhat you made in a month would have taken me a year to\\nscrape together. ...”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching paused and drew violently at his cigarette.\\nHe was about to go on when Ho Shen-an stopped him:\\n\\n“Come now, that’s all past history. What’s the point in going\\nover it all again?—-But tell me, though: are you going to have\\nanother go at the stock business?”\\n\\n“Another go? Well, to tell you the truth, I’m a bit scared now.\\nI was going over the ups and downs of the stock market this\\nmorning, and I decided the stock business is a bit too tricky.\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve told me about the crafty dodges they get up to,\\nI’m finished with it for good. Besides, after a crash like that,\\nI’ve got nothing left to start with—but what about you,\\nShen-an?”\\n\\n“Every penny of ten years’ savings down the drain! Yesterday\\nI sold a few curios at a tea-house gathering just to get a thousand\\ndollars or so to tide me over the festival. But I’m sure you\\'re\\nbetter off: you’ve got plenty of land, and the rent alone must\\nbe quite a—”\\n\\nHo Shen-an broke off as Feng Yun-ching sprang to his feet and\\nthrew himself down on the couch again. All the colour had\\ndrained from his face, his eyes were bloodshot and staring, and\\nthe corners of his mouth twitched uncontrollably. Ho Shen-an\\ngaped at him in surprise and scratched his head. After a mo-\\nment, Feng Yun-ching raised his hand tensely and slammed it\\ndown on a low table beside him.\\n\\n“Rent?” he spat out between clenched teeth. “Who dares\\ngo down into the villages for rent these days? If I could collect\\nmy rents, d’you think I’d have left a perfectly good country\\nhouse of that size to come and live in this hole in Shanghai\\nand stay here worrying myself to death about robbery and\\nkidnapping day in, day out?”\\n\\nHe slumped down on the couch and closed his eyes, panting\\nhard.\\n\\n“No, it’s none too peaceful down in the country, I know,” Ho\\nShen-an said slowly after a moment’s pause. “But, Yun-ching,\\nwhy should you let those damned tenants of yours get away with\\nit? What’s to stop you taking a few strong-arm men down to\\npersuade them?”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he toyed with his alpaca cap, gazing at it, and\\nblowing at it between phrases. Finally, he fished out a handker-\\nchief and flicked at specks of dust on it, a shadow of a smile on\\nhis smooth, oily round face.\\n\\nSprawled on his back, Feng Yun-ching could only sigh in\\nanswer to this question. He was, of course, well acquainted\\nwith the method of collecting rents with an armed escort, but\\nhe was also quite aware that the peasants were not like they\\nused to be. If you went with a mere handful of men, they were\\nno use at all; if you took a lot, they ate their heads off, and even\\n\\nif they did manage to get you something, it was never enough\\nto pay their wages and expenses: no, the game was not worth\\nthe candle. That was a lesson Feng Yun-ching had already\\nlearned once to his cost. The “Smiling Tiger,” shrewd old rogue\\nthat he was, had since preferred to let his rents fall in arrears\\nfor a year, and count on the chance that the coming year would\\nbe peaceful enough for him to go down to the village and use\\nhis usual old tricks to make his tenants fork out every cent of\\nthe compound interest.\\n\\nHo Shen-an lit another cigarette, puffed at it, and started on a\\nnew topic:\\n\\n“Well, Yun-ching, let’s consider how we’re going to recover\\nour losses.”\\n\\n“Recover what losses?” Feng Yun-ching asked nervously, sit-\\nting up with a start. He was still thinking about his property in\\nthe country and his tenants. He seemed to see the grievances of\\nhis tenants issuing like vapours from the murky depths of their\\nhuddled, straw-thatched huts—grievances which dated back\\nthousands of years, grievances against oppression and exploita-\\ntion, now crying out for revenge and redress, grievances which\\nwere about to erupt like a volcano and burn and destroy their\\nfetters and shackles. Yet Ho Shen-an knew nothing of this, and\\nanswered with a smile:\\n\\n“He who has broken his arm three times makes a good sur-\\ngeon.’ Go back to where you lost and recoup your losses!”\\n\\n“Oh, I see, you’re still talking about the stock business.”\\n\\n“Of course I am. Don’t tell me you’ve lost heart.”\\n\\n“I haven’t exactly lost heart: I’ve just got cold feet,” Feng\\nYun-ching answered with another sigh, trying hard to keep back\\nhis tears. “The way they set that trap and let us walk right\\ninto it!”\\n\\nHo Shen-an burst out laughing. He picked up his walking-\\nstick, pointed it at Feng Yun-ching, described an arc in the air\\nwith it, then thumped it against the floor as he boomed:\\n\\n“Come, come, old man! I can quite understand that you’re\\na bit shaken up after the crash, but don’t you see?—-The mere\\nfact that people can set traps and get away with it shows that\\nsuccess is not a matter of luck: it depends on your method of\\n\\ndoing business. And that’s why I say we\\'ve got a fair chance\\nof recouping our losses—”\\n\\n“Shen-an—”\\n\\n“Don’t interrupt. Now, listen! It was Chao Po-tao and his\\nfriends who set this trap. They’re experts at that sort of game\\nand we obviously don’t stand a chance against them. Now if\\nonly we can do a little snooping and get hold of their secret, we\\ncan recover our losses easily!”\\n\\nAs Ho Shen-an made this pronouncement, he beamed compla-\\ncently and wagged his head. He suddenly slapped his thighs\\nand stood up, then planted himself before Feng Yun-ching with\\nnarrowed eyes, and was about to come out with something im-\\nportant, when Feng Yun-ching knit his brows and said:\\n\\n“T don’t see how you think you\\'re going to go about the snoop-\\ning, though. Chao Po-tao’s a wily old fox—”\\n\\n“But he’s like Prince Huei of Liang: ‘I have one weakness:\\nI like a pretty face.’ With a woman as a decoy we can catch\\nChao Po-tao just like that!”\\n\\nWe said this in an undertone, bending forward with his lips\\nto Feng Yun-ching’s ear, then exploded with laughter.\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching stared at him wide-eyed. He himself. still\\nwore a frown, but a faint blush suffused his pale face. He\\nsuspected that his friend was pulling his leg, for even he must\\nhave heard about the way Feng Yun-ching’s concubine did not\\nget home from her nightly jaunts until the next morning. To\\ncover his embarrassment, he pretended not to notice the sus-\\npected insinuation, and half-heartedly tried to steer the con-\\nversation away.\\n\\n“an excellent idea!” he said, clucking his tongue in admira-\\ntion. “That’s what ten years’ experience on the stormy seas\\nof officialdom does for you! I hope when you\\'ve pulled it off\\nyou\\'ll let me have a finger in the pie, Shen-an.”\\n\\n“I\\'m afraid you\\'ve missed a point,” replied Ho Shen-an, looking\\nserious. “This is a job for you. I can only advise you how to go\\nabout it.”\\n\\nHis voice had fallen to an almost inaudible whisper, yet it\\nthundered in Feng Yun-ching’s ears. His face fell, and his heart\\nbeat wildly, though whether from delight or anger—or was it\\nperhaps fear?—he could not tell. Being quite at a loss how to\\n\\nreply, he could only stare blankly at Ho Shen-an’s oily, smiling\\nround face. Ho Shen-an shook his head, then opened his mouth\\nand let the tip of his yellow-furred tongue flicker out and in\\nagain.\\n\\n“People admire Chao Po-tao for his shrewdness,” he resumed\\nquietly. “They say he can tell a genuine gem from a fake at a\\nglance, and that he can tell a virgin straight away. He likes\\nhis women brand-new, and so long as he’s the first, he doesn’t\\nworry particularly what they’re like: they’re all grist to his\\nmill. He’s got a room in a hotel which he keeps specially for\\nthis purpose, and he’s always prowling around a certain roof-\\ngarden in search of fresh talent. So, you see, it’ll be quite easy\\nto hook him if only we can—”\\n\\n“If only we can what?” Feng Yun-ching asked eagerly as he\\nrose from the couch, his eyes gleaming with interest.\\n\\n“Tf only we can find a clever, pretty and reliable girl... like\\nyour daughter, say,” replied Ho Shen-an calmly and unhurriedly,\\na smile on his lips. He still spoke in an undertone, but enunciated\\neach word clearly and carefully.\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching gulped uncomfortably, and his face blanched\\nas he sat dazedly down on the couch again and stared up into\\nhis friend’s plump face. The latter, however, betrayed no sign\\nof emotion, but moved closer and went on furtively:\\n\\n“Tt’s our only way! You’re afraid it won’t work? You needn’t\\nbe afraid of that: I give you my word it\\'ll work!—Yun-ching,\\nyou don’t know how lucky you are to have a daughter like\\nthat... .”\\n\\n“But, Shen-an!”\\n\\n“Once you’ve hooked him, you can do what you like with\\nhim afterwards. You can go ahead with your business in the\\nsmooth way or the rough way; the old-fashioned way or the\\nmodern way—take your pick. Don’t worry; you can trust me:\\nI’m a most reliable adviser. To be frank, Yun-ching, you beat\\nme hollow when it comes to fleecing peasants, but I’m better than\\nyou at snooping around, and setting a pretty sprat to catch a fat\\nmackerel!”\\n\\nHo Shen-an chuckled and took a sip at his tea, then clasped his\\nhands behind his back and turned to look up at a photograph\\nhanging on the wall—a family group with Feng Yun-ching’s\\ndaughter Mei-ching gracefully occupying the centre of the picture.\\nHe stood gazing a long time at the photograph, so as to give\\nFeng Yun-ching plenty of time to turn his suggestion over in\\nhis mind. As he stood there, the sun went behind the clouds,\\nleaving the room gloomy. From upstairs came the sound of girl-\\nish laughter and somewhere a tap was running, while the lane\\noutside echoed with the cries of pedlars hawking meat-pies,\\ndumplings and noodles.\\n\\nBut not a sound came from Feng Yun-ching.\\n\\nHo Shen-an turned to look in the long mirror as it stood like\\na transparent door in the corner of the room. In it was re-\\nflected Feng Yun-ching’s face, wary and undecided. Suddenly,\\nthe corners of his mouth twitched and wrinkled up and his\\nbeady eyes shifted from side to side—he seemed to be making\\nup his mind at last. Ho Shen-an could not help turning round\\nto look at him. Just at that moment, Feng Yun-ching muttered\\nto himself:\\n\\n“Set a trap for him to walk into, eh?”\\n\\n“That’s right, Yun-ching!” Ho Shen-an hurriedly assured him,\\nthen sat down opposite him. Feng Yun-ching twisted his lips\\ninto an uneasy smile and tried another tack:\\n\\n“Joking apart, Shen-an, you say it’s the battles at the front\\nthat affect the stock market, but that’s not the whole of it: I\\nthink the big speculators’ manipulations are also an important\\nfactor. They’ve got the money to manoeuvre with. This fellow\\nChao Po-tao’s one of them, but how can we get his secrets\\nout of him? You\\'re a crafty old fox if you can do that, Shen-an!”\\n\\nHo Shen-an did not seem to be in any hurry to enlighten him:\\nhe just raised his eyebrows and burst out laughing. He saw\\nthrough Feng Yun-ching, who was already becoming interested\\nin his proposition, though he did not dare admit it to his face.\\n\\nRealizing his embarrassment, Ho Shen-an smiled to himself,\\nthen stood up and patted Feng Yun-ching on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Don’t be so modest, old man,” he said. “I’m no cleverer\\nthan you are. Just do as you think fit! But now I must be off.”\\n\\n*\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching saw his friend to the gate, then turned back\\nand lingered a moment in the little yard, staring absently at the\\n\\npots of red azaleas and the goldfish tank. Suddenly, he burst\\nout laughing to himself, but hardly had he stopped laughing,\\nwhen a couple of tears rolled down his cheeks. He raised two\\nfingers and felt his eyes, as if he could not believe they were\\nactually tears. As he looked at the azaleas through his blurred\\neyes, they seemed to be transformed into his daughter’s dimples.\\nHe looked at the goldfish tank: the fish had turned into gold bars.\\nHe heaved a sigh and came to, then hurried back indoors and\\nslumped on to a sofa.\\n\\nHe puckered his forehead in an effort to sort out in his mind\\nthe various urgent matters requiring his attention, but the same\\nthree things kept going round and round in his head:\\nthat his daughter was pretty; that money was so precious; and\\nthat Chao Po-tao could easily be hooked. All of a sudden, he\\nflared up, slapped himself on the face, and began reviling himself\\nthrough clenched teeth!\\n\\n“You old cuckold! You’re making yourself ridiculous! Ho\\nShen-an’s just making a fool of you! Anyone who’s meddled\\nwith officialdom for long must be lower than a snake’s belly,\\nand Ho Shen-an’s just that sort. You\\'re a respectable landlord,\\nand you come from a good family. How could you ever listen to\\nHo Shen-an’s nonsense? Are you so weak that you’d sink to\\nthat? No! You must try to do something with your property\\nin the country!”\\n\\nAfter this he felt a bit better and squared his shoulders again,\\nbut another problem kept nagging at his mind: the peasants\\nwere rioting and most probably he was no longer able to call all\\nthose hundreds of acres of good land his own—yet he still had\\nto pay land-tax on them just the same. He shook his head\\nruefully as he stood up and looked round to make sure that he\\nwas still in his own comfortable room: he seemed to be hearing\\nthe distant rumble of explosions coming nearer and nearer,\\nlouder and louder!\\n\\nHe was jolted out of his day-dream by a loud knocking at the\\nBate. Startled, he shambled out and peeped through the crack\\nof the door at the caller outside. When he saw that it was not\\nHan Meng-hsiang coming again for the money, or anybody else\\nfrom the Exchange, the colour returned to his face.\\n\\nThe visitor was Li Chuang-fei, a middle-aged man who dis-\\ntinguished himself by wearing an up-to-date toothbrush mous-\\ntache. He was one of Feng Yun-ching’s fellow-speculators in\\ngovernment bonds and a recently-made acquaintance of his.\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching bowed his friend into the room, glancing at\\nhim as he did so to see how he looked after the disaster in the\\nstock market, and was surprised to find a rather elated smile cn\\nhis face, a smile reminiscent of Ho Shen-an’s when he came in.\\nFeng Yun-ching immediately felt ill at ease. He was afraid this\\n“revolutionary” ex-magistrate also had some worrying, fantastie\\nplan up his sleeve, something to throw him into another dilemma.\\nAged by the events of the past few days, Feng Yun-ching felt\\nthat his tormented nerves could stand no more worry.\\n\\nIt came as a surprise to him, then, when Li Chuang-fei began\\ngetting his own tale of woe off his chest the moment he sat down:\\n\\n“It just can’t help being a bit superstitious, Yun-ching: J’m\\nfated to be unlucky this year. Every single plan I’ve made since\\nNew Year’s Day has fallen through. In March I managed to secure\\na position as a county magistrate, but less than a month later the\\nCommunists came and bang went my job. And what could I\\ndo in a month? However hard I’d been on the peasants, I could\\nnever have made enough to cover the money I’d laid out when\\nI bought the post. How could I? Never mind: at least I got a\\nglimpse of what the job was like. The next thing I did was even\\nmore disastrous. I paid out every penny of eighteen thousand\\ndollars for a post as an inspector of taxes. They assured me it\\nwas a cushy job with plenty of pickings, and my superiors sent\\nabout a dozen relatives of theirs to be clerks in my office. I hur-\\nried down to my new post in the highest spirits, but I’d only\\nbeen settled in two days when the war—damn it!—had to break\\nout right in my area of all places. The enemy took over my dis-\\ntrict and sent one of their own officials to replace me. If I hadn’t\\nmade my escape there and then, there’s no telling what would\\nhave happened to me! So you see, Yun-ching, it’s no fun at all\\nbeing any sort of official these days—”\\n\\n“But I know you never say die! You\\'ve still got a whole army\\nof secretaries and clerks around you, and your rooms in the hotel\\nare more like a yamen than anything else.”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching forced a smile as he said this, because he\\nhad heard that Li Chuang-fei, the famous “revolutionary magis-\\ntrate,” used his “revolutionary” methods not only in public af-\\nfairs but also in his financial dealings with friends. Though he\\nhad never benefited from Li Chuang-fei’s kind attentions, Feng\\nYun-ching had long been aware of his reputation, and as he\\nnow listened to his outpourings of woe, he was naturally rather\\nwary.\\n\\nLi Chuang-fei smiled, looked round furtively, and said in a low\\nvoice:\\n\\n“To tell you the truth, those secretaries and clerks of mine are\\nall ‘log-rollers’ for me, and I couldn’t very well get rid of them.\\nOn the other hand, I have to spend a lot on their upkeep, and\\nthat keeps me short. On top of that, I lost quite a lot on the\\nstock market the other day, as you probably know. And now it’s\\nnearly quarter-day and I’ve got a lot of accounts to settle—just\\nguess how much I’m short of still!”\\n\\nSo it was just as Feng Yun-ching had feared! His heart missed\\na beat and his face fell. He could not think what to say for a\\nmoment. Li Chuang-fei seemed to read his thoughts, for he\\nlooked glum and said in a more sober tone of voice:\\n\\n“Don’t misunderstand me, Yun-ching! I know you\\'ve lost\\nquite heavily this time, but surely you’re not going to wash\\nyour hands of it? I have discovered a way of recouping our\\nlosses, and I came specially to discuss it with you. If only we\\ncan get it financed properly, this plan will give great results.”\\n\\nFar from being inspired by Li Chuang-fei’s optimism, Feng\\nYun-ching became all the more uneasy, and the expression on his\\nface became more troubled than ever. He just stood there\\nwithout a word, gazing wide-eyed into space. For a few mo-\\nments Li Chuang-fei stood looking at him with a sardonic smile.\\n\\n“Call yourself ‘the Smiling Tiger’ when you\\'re floored by a\\nlittle bit of trouble like this?’ he jeered. “—Though I’m not\\nsurprised, really. You’ve been used to a nice, comfortable Life\\nas a wealthy landlord, just collecting your rents and interest.\\nBut if you’re going to gamble on the Stock Exchange these days,\\nyou\\'ll find you’re half a million up today and broke tomorrow,\\nand you don’t like that sort of game, apparently. Well, Yun-\\nching, Pll give you a word of advice which will help you to like\\n\\nit. There’s only one thing you’ve got to be if you\\'re going to\\nspeculate: ruthless! Now, suppose yow’re a bull and you buy\\na hundred thousand Disbandment and the settlement leaves you\\nnothing at all. All right! You go ahead and buy two hundred\\nthousand more, and so you keep on, snowball-fashion. You\\'ll\\nnotice that’s exactly how the government issues ponds: in the\\nfirst half of the year they issue two lots of seventy million, and\\nin the second half, sure as eggs is eggs, they\\'ll issue four lots —\\notherwise, how could they carry on financially?”\\n\\n“But what’s that got to do with us coming a cropper on the\\nExchange?” objected Feng Yun-ching. “Other people—”\\n\\nHe broke off with a sigh, and Li Chuang-fei quickly stepped in\\nagain:\\n\\n“Ah, but don’t you see, that’s where we come in! Since the\\nmarket’s bound to be flooded with more and more money, it’s\\ngoing to fluctuate more and more from day to day. The smallest\\nchange in the political situation will immediately affect the\\nprices, and give the stock-jobber an excellent opportunity of\\nfishing in troubled waters. Go and ask any old hand at the\\ngame, and he’ll tell you he’s never happier than when the war-\\nlords start making trouble again. On the other hand, if the\\npolitical situation remains stable, and you lose, then you lose\\nfor good, and there’s no chance of going in again tomorrow and\\nrecouping your losses. As it is, you’ve got every opportunity—\\nany day—of recovering what you’ve lost.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to tell me you like wars?”\\n\\n“Not always. When I was an inspector of taxes, I was any-\\nthing but pleased about it. Now that I’m a stock-jobber, naturally\\nmy likes and dislikes have changed—And I\\'ll tell you another\\nthing: now, you know we all go in for Disbandment and Dis-\\narmament? Well, the government makes these two issues under\\nthe pretence of trying to end the civil war once and for all,\\nwhereas, in actual fact, these bonds are only adding fuel to the\\nflames. It’s like this: as soon as a war breaks out, the peasants\\ndown in the country turn bandits and the Communists become\\ntwice as active, with the result that the rich landlords pack their\\nbags and flock into Shanghai with their money to get away from\\nthem; then, as ready cash accumulates in Shanghai, so the gov-\\nernment issues bonds to absorb it—tens of millions of dollars’\\n\\nworth at a time. But the money they raise in this way goes to\\nfinance the fighting, and as the fighting gets worse, so does the\\nunrest among the peasants. Result: more and more rich lJand-\\nlords flock into Shanghai from the country with their money,\\nand the government seizes the opportunity to issue more bonds.\\nAnd so you get a vicious circle of bonds and bombs. Do you\\nget the hang of it now, Yun-ching? Civil war may mean disaster\\nfor other businessmen, but stock-jobbers thrive on it. If the\\ncivil war went on for a thousand years, you can bet your bottom\\ndollar there’d be a thousand years of prosperity for the stock-\\njobbing business!”\\n\\nWhen he paused, Feng Yun-ching used the spittoon and asked\\nin a worried voice, “Do you think there’s going to be trouble in\\nthe country for a long time yet, then, Chuang-fei?”\\n\\n“Oh, come now, old man, you’re not still dreaming that you\\ncan go back to being a happy-go-lucky landlord, are you? I\\ntell you: in a year or two’s time, you wouldn’t be able to give\\nyour land-deeds away, let alone sell them!”\\n\\nThis reply came as a cold douche to Feng Yun-ching, who\\ncould only gape in consternation at Li Chuang-fei’s plump, im-\\npudent face, waiting for him to go on. When he saw that he\\nhad no more to say, and that he was in dead earnest, Feng Yun-\\nching suddenly felt a buzzing in his ears, and his head swam.\\nFor several days he had been racking his brains what to do\\nabout his landed property, and now he had his answer—though\\nit broke his heart to hear it. With an effort he pulled himself\\ntogether and fumed through clenched teeth:\\n\\n“If that’s the case, then the government is definitely failing\\nto do its duty by us landowners!”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t say that. After all, the government’s always\\nissuing large quantities of bonds and giving you landowners who\\ncome to the city a chance to get rich! The opportunity to make\\na hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollars at one\\nstroke is not to be sneezed at!”\\n\\nWhether naturally or deliberately it was hard to say, Li\\nChuang-fei’s voice was the acme of calmness and his face wore\\na cheerful grin as he gave this reply. Feng Yun-ching was heart-\\nbroken and on the verge of tears; nevertheless, he had at ladgt\\nmade up his mind about the dilemma in which he had found\\n\\nhimself since Ho Shen-an’s visit: he had decided that he had no\\nalternative but to throw everything he had into a do-or-die effort\\nto regain his fortunes on the Exchange. His voice trembled as\\nhe raised his head and said:\\n\\n“But I’m ruined! How can you sit there and talk about me\\nmaking a fortune? Though—Chuang-fei, just what is this plan\\nof yours?”\\n\\nInstead of replying immediately, Li Chuang-fei drew deeply\\nat his cigarette, then calmly began blowing smoke-rings into\\nthe air. He knew that once he had caught the sly fox he need\\nnot worry about him escaping. He let a good three minutes pass\\nbefore he proposed abruptly, “Yun-ching, I think your land-\\nholdings down in the country could be mortgaged for cash before\\nit’s too late. Why not dispose of them while you can?”\\n\\nIt was now Feng Yun-ching’s turn to be reticent. He merely\\nrolled his eyes uneasily and nodded slightly.\\n\\n“Now, don’t misunderstand me: I’m only advising you for your\\nown good to dispose of your property.—To get back to the ques-\\ntion of speculating in government bonds, what I suggest is briefly\\nas follows. You and I will go into partnership, and the decision\\non what to buy or sell will rest entirely with me. If we lose,\\nwe\\'ll go fifty-fifty; if we make a profit, we’ll also go fifty-fifty,\\nbut you’ll give up thirty per cent of your share of the profits as\\na special bonus for me. There’s one other thing I must make clear:\\nWhen we pay the deposit, you’ll pay sixty per cent, and I\\'ll pay\\nforty—call this my advantage, if you like. I’ve got a draft for\\nthirty thousand dollars on a local bank on me, but I don’t want\\nto discount it before it falls due, because I won’t get very much\\nfor it if I do, what with the crippling charges. And it doesn’t\\nfall due until the sixteenth of next month—”\\n\\n“When it comes to cash I’m even worse off than you are,”\\nFeng Yun-ching assured him hurriedly, which was quite true;\\nand besides, Li Chuang-fei’s methods were so unorthodox that\\nFeng Yun-ching decided he could not be too cautious. Not to\\nbe outdone, the versatile Li Chuang-fei immediately found a\\nchink in the other’s armour and plunged in:\\n\\n“Come off it! If you’re short of cash, all you’ve got to do is\\nto mortgage your estate in the country. Matter of fact, I know\\na certain major-general who comes from your part of the coun-\\n\\ntry; I can easily persuade him to invest in a bit of property in\\nhis own district. You can safely leave the whole business in my\\nhands. If you need a few thousand to tide you over the festival,\\njust let me know and I\\'ll let you have what you want—and with-\\nout security, too.—There’s just one thing, though: the Exchange\\nopens again the day after tomorrow, and you\\'ll have to look\\nsharp about it if you’re thinking of going in again. Whether\\nyou\\'re buying or selling, remember the early bird gets the worm!”\\n\\n“What would you advise me to do, precisely?”\\n\\n“Ah! I can give you it in a nutshell. Everybody knows that\\nthe one man who’s made a packet this time is Chao Po-tao, but\\nthe brain behind him is Wu Sun-fu. Wu Sun-fu has a good\\nfriend in the army fighting at the front, and this friend of his\\nsends him red-hot information about the latest developments.\\nNow, I know a stockbroker who’s a relative of Wu Sun-fu’s, and\\nwho handles most of Wu Sun-fu’s business on the Exchange—\\naman by the name of Lu Kuang-shih. The thing is, I’ve come\\nto an agreement with this fellow: he’ll tip me off from time to\\ntime about what Wu Sun-fu’s doing in the Exchange, so that\\nwe can follow his line; then, if we make anything out of it,\\nhe’ll get a cut of the takings. How does that strike you? Re-\\nmember, Yun-ching: he who hesitates is lost!”\\n\\nWith this Li Chuang-fei rose to go, smoothing his moustache\\nwith one hand and reaching for his Panama hat with the other.\\n\\nJust at that moment, the sound of two women quarrelling came\\nfrom upstairs. As soon as he heard it, Feng Yun-ching knew\\nthat it was his concubine and his daughter and he became more\\ndistraught than ever. He stood up mechanically, bowed to Li\\nChuang-fei with clasped hands, and said hurriedly:\\n\\n“It was very good of you to call, and I’m most grateful for all\\nyou’ve told me. To tell you the truth, I could do with a few\\nthousand to see me through, so I think I’ll take you up on your\\noffer of a loan—I’ll drop in to see you at the hotel tomorrow.”\\n\\nLi Chuang-fei assented effusively, told Feng Yun-ching the\\nbest time to call, and departed well pleased with himself. As\\nsoon as he had gone, Feng Yun-ching dashed upstairs in a flurry,\\nintending to make peace between the quarrelling women. As\\nhe reached the door of his room, he heard a crash, followed by\\na sneering laugh from his concubine. White as a sheet, he stopped\\n\\ndead in his tracks. He stood for a moment with his head on\\none side, scratching his ear, but almost immediately plucked up\\ncourage, lifted the door-curtain gently aside, and slipped into\\nthe room, where he found his concubine sitting on the opium-\\ncouch, looking as black as thunder, and her maid kneeling on the\\nfloor picking up the fragments of a broken porcelain bowl. There\\nwas a pool of bird’s-nest porridge on the blue and white carpet\\nin front of the couch. Chin Mah, the hairdresser maid, stood\\nbehind the concubine, smiling to herself and toying with a comb.\\n\\nSeeing that his daughter was not there, Feng Yun-ching felt\\nslightly relieved. It looked as though his daughter had made\\na lightning attack and retired immediately from the battlefield,\\nleaving her enemy to vent her rage on the maid.\\n\\n“So here you are at last!” the concubine sneered. “Are you\\nsure you haven’t come into the wrong room? You ought to have\\ngone and seen your darling little daughter first—she got the\\nworst of it!”\\n\\nShe turned her head sulkily away as she spoke, but at the\\nsame time watched Feng Yun-ching out of the corner of her\\neye. He doubled up with laughter, but it had a hollow ring;\\nthen he started taking it out on the maid:\\n\\n“Huh! You get worse and worse! Can’t you even carry a\\nbowl of porridge without dropping it? Go on, hurry up and\\nfetch another—don’t just squat there!”\\n\\n“Don’t pretend to be telling her off when it’s me you\\'re having\\na dig at!” snapped the concubine, jerking her head sharply\\nround and glaring at Feng Yun-ching, her beady eyes ablaze\\nwith fury. When she saw that he was smiling tenderly at her,\\nshe gave a bitter laugh and went on:\\n\\n“pyen this little bitch is taking liberties with me—giving me\\nscalding hot porridge to eat!—Though she’d never have dared to\\ndo it if somebody else hadn’t put her up to it. Now tell me\\nstraight—”\\n\\n“There, there, my dear. Don’t get so upset about it. Have a\\nsmoke to calm your nerves—I’ll roast you a few beads of opium\\nmyself. Chin Mah, hurry up and do your mistress’s hair. There’s\\na special contest at the Ming Gardens at nine o’clock tonight.\\nOh, and, Chiu: Mr. Pai’s concubine Wu rang through and sug-\\ngested a dozen games of mahjong with you first before you all\\n\\ngo off to the Ming Gardens. Look, the sun\\'s going down so you’d\\nbetter hurry up. And don’t get so upset over a silly little thing\\nlike that.”\\n\\nAs he tried to soothe her, he tipped Chin Mah a wink to do\\nup her hair. Then, with a hearty laugh, he settled himself on\\nthe couch and picked up the needle, put a bead of opium on it,\\nand began roasting it over the flame. Despite his outward cheer-\\nfulness, he felt thoroughly miserable.\\n\\n“Yes,” began Chin Mah, trying to cheer her mistress up as she\\ndeftly combed the concubine’s hair into shape, “our Miss Mei-\\nching may look like a grown-up, but she’s still only a child,\\nreally, and she doesn’t realize what she’s saying. Later on, when\\nyou feel better, you should explain to her that she must behave\\nherself, and not upset you like this——Now, what about doing you\\na horizontal S, madam?”\\n\\nThe concubine made no reply, for she was thinking about Mr.\\nPai’s concubine Wu, a “sworn sister” of hers. The reason why\\nChiu had such a hold over Feng Yun-ching was that she had a\\ncertain amount of influence with Mr. Pai through his concubine.\\nWhen Feng Yun-ching had first arrived in Shanghai, he had\\nreceived threatening letters from kidnappers demanding protec-\\ntion-money. His concubine did a little string-pulling through\\nMr. Pai’s concubine, and was so successful that nothing more\\nwas heard from the kidnappers. It was only then that Feng\\nYun-ching realized that a rich man from the country who had\\ncome to find himself a comfortable niche in Shanghai was not\\nhalf so powerful as a concubine with her wide social connections.\\nAnd this was why he had long ceased to question his concubine\\nabout her night life.\\n\\nWhen the maid had picked up the broken pieces and cleaned\\nup the spilled porridge, she brought in a fresh bowl of bird’s-\\nnest porridge—this time neither too hot nor too cool. Chin Mah\\nhad finished doing the concubine’s hair and had gone into the\\nnext room to lay out her clothes. Feng Yun-ching had put a\\nbead of opium in the bowl of the opium-pipe and laid it ready\\non the plate, and had now closed his eyes to consider once more\\nHo Shen-an’s and Li Chuang-fei’s suggestions. He thought that\\nif he could believe what Li had told him, then Li’s plan was\\nmuch better than Ho’s idea of “snooping.” Of course, the chances\\n\\nof succeeding would be twice as good if both their plans were\\nput into execution together. . . . But how could he do what\\nHo had suggested? After all, he had the high family traditions\\nto consider! And another thing: his concubine had already\\ngot the upper hand of him for “special reasons’—what if his\\ndaughter should now get a hold over him in the same way? With\\ntwo of them exerting pressure on him, he’d be between the devil\\nand the deep blue sea! If only he could believe everything Li\\nChuang-fei told him! And yet—\\n\\nAt this point his train of thought was interrupted by his con-\\ncubine’s voice as she sipped the bird’s-nest porridge and clinked\\nthe silver spoon against the bowl:\\n\\n“It’s the Dragon-boat Festival the day after tomorrow. I sup-\\npose you’ve done everything?”\\n\\n“Eh? What did you say?” asked Feng Yun-ching nervously,\\nlooking up quickly.\\n\\n“Don’t tell me you don’t know what you ought to have done!\\nI mean about the presents, of course! Mr. Pai’s Wu and the\\nothers have been very good to you: you can’t very well let the\\nfestival go by without giving them anything!”\\n\\n“Oh, er—no. I hadn’t forgotten it for a moment. But, my\\ndear Chiu, you know I’ve lost every penny I had on the Exchange,\\nand I’m nearly six thousand dollars in debt as well. I was\\nwondering if you could think of a way of helping me out—”\\n\\n“If you want me to get you a loan of ten thousand dollars, or\\neight, or whatever you want, that’s easy enough, but what about\\nsecurities? You don’t think anybody would take your old land-\\ndeeds as security!”\\n\\n“That’s just it. That’s why I was hoping you’d be able to help\\nme out. There’s a friend of mine named Li who’s promised me\\na loan, but I don’t think I can depend on him. I’ve only got a\\ncouple of days, anyway. I’d be in a bit of a mess if I couldn’t\\npay up!”\\n\\nWhen he had had his say, the concubine returned to her por-\\nridge. When she had finished it, she put her head on one side\\nand tittered, but said nothing. She knew all about his coming\\nto grief over the government bonds, but she refused to believe he\\nwas as badly off as all that. If he wanted her to get him a loan,\\nshe had no objection: the money would pass through her hands,\\n\\nand she could take her commission to meet her own expenses\\nover the festival.\\n\\nShe began to pick her teeth, and after a while she smiled and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Of course, I could quite easily borrow a few thousand even\\nwithout any security. If I ask my friend Wu for it, she wouldn’t\\nlike to make me lose face by refusing it. But I think we should\\ntry and save face a bit by offering her some security. Don’t you\\nagree? Now, your land-deeds wouldn’t be any good, but I seem\\nto remember you’ve got a deposit account of ten thousand dollars\\nin the Yuan Feng Local Bank. ”\\n\\n“Er—oh, no! No, we can’t touch that!” Feng Yun-ching an-\\nswered hastily, springing up and all but overturning the opium-\\nlamp as he did so. His concubine pursed her lips in annoyance\\nand snorted scornfully, then lay down on the couch, picked up\\nthe pipe, and began drawing noisily at it.\\n\\n“No, we mustn’t use that money, Chiu,” Feng Yun-ching gasped\\nin horror, creasing his brow. “It belongs to Mei-ching. When\\nher mother died, her uncles got together to discuss what to do\\nwith the money she’d left, and they decided to set aside this\\nten thousand dollars and put it in the bank, and it wasn’t to be\\ntouched until Mei-ching marries and takes it along with her as\\nher dowry.”\\n\\nFrom the dowry his thoughts travelled back to just after his\\nwife’s death, when he had acquired this concubine despite the\\nprotests of Mei-ching’s uncle. His brother-in-law had not liked\\nthe concubine from the moment he had clapped eyes on her, and\\nhad told Feng Yun-ching: “This woman with her flat round face\\nis sure to bring you bad luck and ruin you: I can tell it from\\nher features.” As if in fulfilment of the prophecy, his luck had\\nbecome worse from year to year, until he had found himself in\\nhis present straits. He sighed involuntarily, then glanced quickly\\nat his concubine to see if she was reading his thoughts, and was\\nrather disconcerted to find her sharp eyes on him. As he caught\\nher eye, he looked uncomfortably away and stared at the sizzling\\nbowl of the opium-pipe, an uneasy smile on his face.\\n\\nFortunately for him, it seerned she had not noticed his changes\\nof expression, for she merely moved her pipe an inch or two\\n\\naway from her mouth, breathed out two plumes of grey smoke\\nfrom her nostrils, and said in an unusually gentle voice:\\n\\n“Very eager to be a father-in-law, eh? Yes, everything’s ready\\nfor the wedding, dowry and all—all you want now is for your\\nfuture son-in-law to come and kowtow to you. But don’t kid\\nyourself—it won’t work out like that at all! You seem to think\\nyou’re still—pah! You’re dreaming! Wake up, do!”\\n\\n“What d’you mean?—”\\n\\n“Don’t you really know or are you only pretending not to?”\\nShe tittered. She seemed more exultant than angry.\\n\\n“I don’t understand—”\\n\\n“No, and I don’t understand either why a girl of good family\\nshould not prefer to have a big, stylish wedding and why she\\nshould even turn her nose up at nice, fat dowry of ten thousand\\ndollars or so—”\\n\\n“Chiu!” cried Feng Yun-ching goaded beyond endurance.\\nShe sounded to him as if she was revelling in his discomfiture,\\nbut with two pipefuls of opium inside her there was no stopping\\nher, and he did not have a chance of getting a word in edge-\\nways.\\n\\n“Don’t you shout at me! I’m only a poor ignorant girl and\\nI don’t understand these new ways—not like your daughter!\\nShe’s a student, a modern girl; she speaks English, and has her\\nown way of doing things: once she’s taken a fancy to a man,\\nshe’d just sneak away with him. These modern girls have got\\ntheir own way of showing respect for their parents—they just\\nmarry themselves off, and their parents just have to lump it!”\\n\\nShe laid down the pipe and shook her head disapprovingly.\\nHer face was serious now.\\n\\n“1 don’t believe it!’ Feng- Yun-ching burst out, his face quite\\npale now. His straggly moustache twitched nervously, and his\\neyes glazed. He stared at his concubine with a mingled look of\\nsuspicion and alarm. One question kept preying on his mind:\\nWas it inevitable that she would take advantage of her freedom\\nto elope with some man or other? But the concubine had fur-\\nther shocks in store for him:\\n\\n“you don’t believe it? All right, so I’m making it up, then!\\nBut just you wait and see! He looks like a good-for-nothing\\nstudent; comes from away somewhere; funny-looking chap—\\n\\nprobably one of these Communists that you hear about. Anyway,\\nI don’t expect you’d be very keen on him as a son-in-law. But\\neven if you’re not it won’t make any difference—these new-\\nfangled girls are as slippery as eels!”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching felt like a criminal who has just heard his\\nsentence pronounced: his fate was sealed. He gulped and looked\\nwildly about him, his fingertips trembling. When he closed his\\neyes, he could see Ho Shen-an’s flabby round face with its leering\\nsmile—a smile which he now realized to be one of mockery. ...\\nThe so-and-so must have known all along about the shameful\\nway Mei-ching was carrying on, and he probably only came to\\nmake fun of me! As this thought suddenly flashed through\\nhis mind, he felt a strange sensation, for he was not sure whether\\nto be furious with his daughter for her bad behaviour and her\\ndisregard for him, or whether to be piqued that such an affair,\\nwith a man of her own choice, might stand in the way of the\\nplan which Ho Shen-an had suggested. Whichever it was, he felt\\nthat all was now lost.\\n\\nJust then he felt a soft hand stroking the pit of his stomach\\nand heard an even softer voice murmuring tenderly in his ear:\\n\\n“There, there! You mustn’t upset yourself like that. Perhaps\\nI shouldn’t have told you.”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching shook his head dismally and squeezed her\\nstroking hand. After a short pause he moaned:\\n\\n“This house is disgraced! It’s all come as such a shock!—But\\nI’ve never known Mei-ching to stay out all night—she’s always\\nin by eleven or twelve at the very latest. And during the day\\nshe’s at school, so she—she—but I just don’t see how she can ever\\nhave had the time to be enticed away by anybody—”\\n\\nAs he said the last few words, a note of incredulity crept into\\nhis voice, which his concubine was not slow to notice. A flush\\nof anger sprang to her cheeks as she snatched her hand from\\nhis chest and spat in his face.\\n\\n“Pah! You doddering old fool!” she blazed. “Keep your in-\\nsinuations to yourself! Yes, I know I don’t come home till morn-\\ning every day: well, what of it? If you think I’ve got a lover,\\njust you try and prove it!”\\n\\nHe stared back at her in silence, while a smarting bitterness\\nwelled up inside him and his momentary flush of embarrassment\\n\\ngave way to an angry lividness. He could scarcely contain\\nhimself any longer, and was just going to give vent to his rage,\\nwhen a second blow fell:\\n\\n“Well, I do have other men, so there! Mr. Pai’s Wu and I\\nteam up together and go out hunting. You just go and ask her\\nif you don’t believe it!”\\n\\nShe rounded this declaration off with a cynical laugh and\\nslumped back on to the couch, where she busied herself with\\nthe roasting of another bead of opium. The mere mention “Mr.\\nPai’s Wu” had struck terror into his heart. He was like a dog\\non a lead, and his concubine needed only to mention Mr. Pai’s\\nconcubine casually to bring him to heel—in this case, to make\\nhim realize that, even though she picked up with men outside,\\nshe had Wu’s backing, and that he would have to like it or\\nlump it. There was nothing Feng Yun-ching could do about it\\nnow but smile submissively and beg her pardon.\\n\\nFortunately for him, she was in a hurry to get to her mah-\\njong party, and seemed willing to let it go at that. He fussed\\naround her until she had changed and driven off, without so\\nmuch as a glance over her shoulder, in the car that had been\\nordered for her. Once she was gone, he breathed freely once\\nmore and turned to the problem of what to do about his daugh-\\nter. He paced up and down, his face ashen and his lips\\nquivering. He was not only angry with her for bringing dis-\\ngrace upon his “family traditions,” but was also rather irked\\nthat she had not had the sense to make better use of her physical\\ncharms. One thought kept running round in his head: Now that\\nshe’s cheapened herself and surrendered her innocence in this\\nsenseless and indiscreet manner, why shouldn’t I draw her into\\nHo Shen-an’s scheme? Even though I am her father, there\\nwouldn’t really be anything wrong in it. A self-satisfied smile\\nbegan to spread across his face, but gave way in a flash to a\\nfrown as a sudden misgiving assailed his ranging mind: What\\nif his daughter should decide in favour of her lover and refuse\\nto have anything to do with this brilliant scheme? Chao Po-tao\\nwas well into his forties and, although he had a stalwart frame,\\nthere was not the least thing attractive about him.\\n\\nThe sudden raucous cry of a crow on the roof just outside the\\nwindow made him start up in surprise. “If she does refuse,” he\\n\\nmuttered through clenched teeth, “she’s got no consideration at\\nall for her father—none at all!”\\n\\nHe agitatedly paced round the room several times, then looked\\nup at the electric clock: ten past six. Another day as good as\\ngone. It was late, and he had no time to waste. He made up his\\nmind and cleared his throat as if to reassure himself: he was\\ngoing to have a talk with his daughter.\\n\\n*\\n\\nFeng Mei-ching was in her room writing a letter to her friend,\\nexplaining why she would have to cancel their plans for a gay\\ntime over the holiday. She could not very well say that her\\nfather would not give her the money, and she was hard put to\\nit to find a suitable pretext. She tried at first to write in Chinese,\\nbut she found it did not read very smoothly, so she stopped in the\\nmiddie, and tore it up. She changed to English, but found to\\nher annoyance that the words she wanted now were not the ones\\nher teacher had taught her, nor could she find them in her reader;\\nin fact, she was stuck halfway through the first sentence. She\\nrested her chin on her left palm and racked her brains for a\\nwhile, then shifted it to her right hand, her Parker pen still\\nbetween her fingers. Her cheeks were delicately flushed and her\\neyes clear and sparkling, though slightly tired. Finally, unable\\nto concentrate any longer, she fell to doodling on the writing-\\npad. Suddenly, she heard the knob turn in the door, and her\\nfather came into the room.\\n\\nShe had not expected that it would be her father, and with a\\nlittle “oh!” of surprise she bent her head over the desk and tried\\nto cover up the untidy pad with her arms, at the same time gig-\\ngling nervously. Silent and suspicious, Feng Yun-ching peered\\nround the room as if looking for something, but he saw nothing\\nunusual, just the usual litter of sheet-music, handkerchiefs,\\npowder-pufts, scent-bottles and lip-sticks lying all over the place.\\nHaving completed his survey, he came and stood before his\\ndaughter, wondering just how he should begin.\\n\\nMei-ching had stopped giggling, and now looked up into her\\nfather’s face. He seemed to sense a certain resentment in her\\nclear gaze, and dropped his eyes, only to find himself favoured\\nwith a generous side-view of her firm, jutting breasts. He was\\n\\nimmediately conscious of a strange sensation, as if he had only\\njust realized that she was already a woman. At the same time\\nhe felt resentful of the blow she had delivered at his paternal\\nauthority by carrying on as she pleased behind his back. His\\nanger rose, and he began in an unexpectedly stern voice:\\n\\n“Mei-ching, you... you’re no longer a child!—”\\n\\nShe giggled again, and her father, finding it hard to maintain\\nhis stern manner, paused a moment, then went on in a pleasanter\\nvoice:\\n\\n“Yyou’re already seventeen, Mei-ching, and there are a lot of\\nbad men about in Shanghai. You must be very careful who you\\nmake friends with, and not let them take advantage of you—”\\n\\n“Take advantage of me?” she protested, standing up. “Who’s\\ntaken advantage of me now?” She had frowned a little, but at\\nthe same time some of the colour had left her cheeks. He quickly\\nforced a smile and decided to modify what he had been going to\\nsay.\\n\\n“I mean they might be imposing on your generosity,” he ex-\\nplained, and his voice was milder still. “Just think: how much\\ndo you spend a month? About a hundred and fifty dollars, don\\'t\\nyou? You could never spend that much on your own! I was\\nthinking somebody might be sponging on you, eh?”\\n\\n“You want me to account for my pocket money, Daddy? All\\nright: I can tell you my expenses from memory now, if you\\nlike.”\\n\\n“Oh, there’s no need to do that. But I would like to tell you\\nsomething: I crashed completely on the Stock Exchange this\\ntime. Now, that means somebody else has made quite a lot.\\nAnd do you know who it is that’s made a pile this time, Mei-\\nching?—A man named Chao. He’s got a room in a hotel, and\\nstrolls round a certain roof-garden every evening—a big, imposing\\nsort of man in his forties. A great collector of gems and\\ndiamonds—you ought to see his fingers. ad\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching suddenly stopped and just stood there hum-\\nming and hawing, his faltering gaze wandering distractedly over\\nher face. He had now come to the crucial point, and could not\\nmake up his mind whether to come straight out with it or\\nwhether to go at it in a roundabout way by first offering her an\\ninducement. Suddenly a third idea struck him, adding to his\\n\\nmental confusion; it was nothing clear-cut, just a vague uneas-\\niness stirring at the back of his mind. He suddenly wished the\\nskies would fall and the earth open up and swallow him, and\\nwith him his daughter, Chao Po-tao, the Exchange—everything.\\nAs he looked at his daughter’s sparkling eyes and her gently\\nheaving breasts, he suddenly imagined a most improper scene,\\nwhich in turn was followed by another highly improper scene\\nwith himself as the chief actor. And then he seemed to hear\\nsomeone whispering in his ear: “Your concubine isn’t your first\\nwife, so you can let her do as she likes; but your daughter’s\\nyour own flesh and blood.” He shivered. His heart was pounding\\nand he was on the verge of tears. All this passed through his\\nmind in a flash~so quickly that he had no chance to weigh the\\nalternatives and decide what to do.\\n\\nIt was at this juncture that Mei-ching gave him a dazzling\\nsmile and blurted out:\\n\\n“Oh, I know who you mean, Daddy—Chao Po-tao!”\\n\\n“You—well!” Feng Yun-ching gasped in astonishment. The\\nmental turmoil instantly ceased, leaving only two impressions in\\nhis mind: amazement and delight. His immediate reaction was\\nto fire a question at her, though his voice trembled slightly as he\\nspoke:\\n\\n*Do you know him? How did you get to know him?”\\n\\n“I’ve a friend—a girl friend, who knows him.”\\n\\n“You\\'re sure it’s Chao Po-tao? Chao Po-tao the stock-king,\\nthe famous big bull, a big, imposing-looking man?—”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s right,” Mei-ching answered rather impatiently.\\n“That’s him all right!” She picked up a handkerchief and dab-\\nbed at the corner of her mouth, giggling softly. She could not\\nunderstand why her father should be so agitated and surprised,\\nthough she had noticed a slight look of disappointment when she\\nhad told him that it was one of her girl friends who knew Chao\\nPo-tao. But he had not finished with her yet:\\n\\n“This friend of yours, Mei-ching—is she older than you, or\\nyounger?”\\n\\n“Oh, I suppose she’s about three or four years older.”\\n\\n“Ah, that means she’s twenty-one or twenty-two. Where’s\\nshe from? Is she married?”\\n\\n“Er—was: her husband died last year.”\\n\\n“She’s a widow, then. Strange! Wait a minute, what does\\nshe look like? Has she ever been here?”\\n\\n“But, Daddy! Why do you want to know all this?”\\n\\n“Ah, I have my reasons, Mei-ching, I have my reasons. You\\njust tell me what I want to know, and later on I\\'ll tell you all\\nabout it. Now, has she ever been here?”\\n\\nMei-ching did not answer at once. She sat down, smiled at\\nher father, and began twisting her handkerchief round her finger.\\nSuddenly she gave a musical little laugh and said, “No, she\\nhasn’t but you must have seen her—you may even know her.”\\n\\n“Eh?”\\n\\n“She often goes to the Exchange. She\\'s bit taller than me, and\\nshe has a little, oval face with a few faint pockmarks beside her\\nnose—though you wouldn’t notice them unless you looked. She\\nhas a slender waist, pretty lips, and a well-developed figure,\\nand she walks like a European. Can’t you think now who she is,\\nDaddy? She’s always down at the Exchange. Her name’s Liu\\nYu-ying, and her father-in-law’s Lu Kuang-shih, the stockbroker.”\\n\\n“aht Lu Kuang-shih, eh?” Feng Yun-ching cried excitedly.\\n“Yes, that’s the Lu Kuang-shih Li Chuang-fei was telling me\\nabout this afternoon!”\\n\\nHe nodded his head repeatedly as if he had managed to solve\\nsome knotty problem. After a moment he turned and peered\\nclosely at his daughter’s face, as if comparing her features\\nwith Liu Yu-ying’s. Then, taking a deep breath, he inquired\\nanxiously:\\n\\n“But this friend of yours is related to Chao Po-tao, isn’t she?”\\n\\nInstead of replying, Mei-ching gave a strange little laugh and,\\ntilting her head on one side, she shook her long wavy hair, her\\neyes fixed on the floor. Then, with a sudden titter, she raised her\\nhead and looked at her father.\\n\\n“What does it matter whether she’s related to him or not?”\\nshe exclaimed. “Anyway, she’s—oh, Daddy! What do you want\\nto know all these things about her for?”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching could not help laughing, for now he understood\\neverything. So she was not so innocent, after all. Everything\\nwas predestined, and the best thing he could do was to resign\\nhimself to the inevitable. As this general idea had quite taken\\n\\npossession of him, he got down to the point straight away, weigh-\\ning his words carefully:\\n\\n“Ive got a very good reason for asking all these questions,\\nMei-ching. It’s like this. This man Chao Po-tao seems to have\\nthe devil at his elbow—every time he speculates in government\\nbonds, he pulls off a victory. This last time he netted well over\\na million dollars. We bears were all expecting a nice slump,\\nseeing that the Central Army was getting the worst of it against\\nthe North, so you can guess how surprised everybody was when\\nthe situation suddenly changed in favour of the bulls. Your\\nfather went flat broke overnight, Mei-ching! But don’t you\\nworry: I’ve still got a good chance of winning back the money.\\nThe only trouble is that they’re in the know and I’m still in the\\ndark. That’s where I’m sunk. There’s only one thing to do,\\nand that’s to ferret out Chao Po-tao’s secrets. This man Chao\\nPo-tao may be clever, but he’s got one great weakness—he’s too\\nfond of the ladies. A woman can twist him round her little\\nfinger and find out just what she wants! Now, this girl friend\\nof yours is on good terms with him, isn’t she, Mei-ching? That’s\\na godsend: I’m saved! And now I’m entrusting you with an\\nimportant mission: you’re clever, you’re pretty ...oh, you\\nknow what I mean, of course.”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching heaved a deep sigh of relief and grinned sheep-\\nishly at his daughter. Suddenly he was assailed by an over-\\nwhelming inner conflict: on the one hand, he was afraid his\\ndaughter would shake her head; on the other, he was afraid\\nto see her nod in acquiescence. But Mei-ching looked quite\\nnatural and showed no signs of embarrassment as she smiled\\nand nodded her head. She had not quite taken her father’s\\nmeaning, and thought that he wanted Liu Yu-ying to ferret out\\nChao Po-tao’s secrets for him.\\n\\nWhen he saw her nod her head, Feng Yun-ching’s heart missed\\na beat, but almost immediately he felt curiously peaceful. He\\ndrew a little sigh of relief—the die was cast! There was nothing\\nfor it now but to sit tight and see it through. An inevitable\\nsituation had forced him upon an inevitable course.\\n\\n“What if Liu Yu-ying’s not willing?” Mei-ching suddenly\\nasked in a low voice. Her cheeks had crimsoned and her eyes\\nwere fixed on the floor as she spoke. She moved restlessly in\\n\\nher seat, and kept twisting her handkerchief round and round\\nbetween her fingers. Feng Yun-ching was stumped for a mo-\\nment. This time it was he who misunderstood his daughter. He\\ncould only assume she was not experienced enough after all,\\nchild that she was. She looked up at him with twinkling eyes,\\nas if waiting for a clear-cut answer. He put as bold a face as\\nhe could on it:\\n\\n“You silly girl! Surely you don’t need me to tell you that?\\nYou\\'ll just have to sail with the wind. As she’s a friend of yours,\\nyou must know just how jealous she’s likely to be. If you think\\nit better not to try and hide it from her, then don’t. On the\\nother hand, you can go ahead on your own if you think it better\\nto give her a wide berth—”\\n\\n“Oh!” cried Mei-ching faintly, leaning back against the back\\nof the chair. Holding her face in her hands, she began giggling\\nuncontrollably. Feng Yun-ching quickly made his escape before\\nshe could ask any more of these questions which he as a father\\nwould find it embarrassing to answer.\\n\\nScarcely had he sat down in his room downstairs when she\\nappeared carrying a crocodile handbag, as if she was just going\\nout.\\n\\n“Give me some money, Daddy,” she said, pausing in the door-\\nway and kicking her high-heels against the doorsill, as if anxious\\nto be away without more ado. “I can’t very well go visiting\\nfriends without a penny in my pocket.”\\n\\nAfter a moment’s hesitation Feng Yun-ching handed over a\\nhundred dollars. He felt he ought to say something more to\\nher, but when he had seen her to the gate and watched her\\nspring lightly into a rickshaw, he had still said nothing. He\\nstood absently for a while at the gate, half satisfied and half\\nsorry. As he turned to go back in, a charcoal drawing on the\\nwhitewashed wall beside the gate caught his eye. It was a\\nhastily-scrawled tortoise, representing a time-honoured Chinese\\ninsult. Nearby, a couple of slogans, boldly daubed in thick black\\nprinter’s ink: “Join in the Thirtieth of May Demonstration” and\\n“Support the Soviet.” He caught his breath and went suddenly\\npale, then shivered and walked dazedly back to his room, where\\nhe sank down on the couch, feeling sick at heart—how he hated\\nthose peasants and Communists! It was all their fault, with their\\n\\nrebellions and disturbances, that he had to come and seek ref-\\nuge in Shanghai, and once in Shanghai, he had been obliged\\nto turn a blind eye to his concubine’s dissolute night-life, to specu-\\nlate in government bonds, and finally even to employ his own\\ndaughter’s charms to get information and save himself. So far\\nas he could see, this whole series of misfortunes was locked in\\na logical sequence, and it was all due to the fact that the peasants\\nhad taken to rioting and abandoned the temperate ways of their\\nforefathers. He sighed bitterly and said to himself:\\n\\n“So now it’s come to this: I’ve given both my concubine and\\nmy daughter away to be communized! To think that I of all\\npeople should be making a contribution to the ‘communal wife’\\nsystem! And that it should happen here in Shanghai of all\\nplaces! It doesn’t make sense—it just doesn’t make sense!”\\nIX\\n\\nTHE next day was the anniversary of the famous “May Thir-\\ntieth Massacre,” and the Dragon-boat Festival was only two\\ndays away. While some of the citizens of Shanghai, like Feng\\nYun-ching for example, were bustling around trying to raise\\nenough money to tide them over quarter-day by employing every\\ntrick from using women as decoys to blackmail, a number of\\nother citizens were busily engaged in something of a totally dif-\\nferent nature: organizing a demonstration to mark the anniver-\\nsary. Within the past few days, the telegraph poles in the main\\nstreets and the walls of the big houses in the side-streets had\\nbeen scrawled and plastered all over with slogans of every de-\\nscription. It had already been made public that the demonstra-\\ntion would be held in Nanking Road—the scene of the original\\nincident.\\n\\nThe police authorities of the Chinese section, the French Con-\\ncession and the International Settlement had already met to\\ndiscuss how they should co-ordinate their various measures to\\nprevent the demonstration. On the day itself, at about nine\\no\\'clock in the morning, the Settlement police set up a five-mile-\\nlong cordon from the west end of Nanking Road to the Bund\\nand then down to the north end of North Szechuan Road. The\\nwhole route was being continually patrolled by armed police on\\nfoot and motorcycle combinations mounted with light machine-\\nguns. At strategic points, armoured cars had been parked\\nacross the roads with their machine-guns trained on the busier\\nstreet intersections.\\n\\nAt the west end of Nanking Road mounted police patrols gal-\\nloped through the traffic and the crowds in a flurry of flying\\nhooves and foam-flecked bits.\\n\\nAbout this time, two young men and a girl, all in their early\\ntwenties, were strolling past the race course in Tibet Road, head-\\ning northwards towards Nanking Road. As they walked along,\\nthey looked expectantly about them and chatted among them-\\nselves. The two young men were dressed in European style:\\none was respectably dressed in light grey, with knife-edge creases\\nin his carefully-pressed trousers, while the other wore a shabby,\\ndark-blue suit with baggy, untidy trousers. The girl wore a long\\ndress of peacock-green gauze lined with white silk. Needless\\nto say, the sight of this incongruously attired trio walking at\\nsuch a time and in such a place attracted a certain amount of\\nattention.\\n\\nWhen they reached the New World Restaurant, they stopped\\nto gaze at a mounted patrol of three policemen trotting past,\\nthe barrels of the rifles slung on their backs gleaming in the\\nmorning sun. They stood watching until the patrol was out of\\nsight, then the girl said with an air of impatience:\\n\\n“Where are we going? We’ve drifted up and down this road\\nthree times already. I’m just... fed up! Hadn’t we better\\nstop and wait in one place?—Though I suppose you’re going to\\ndisagree again, Pai Ching? Besides, it’s nearly half past nine,\\nand still nothing’s happened. I can’t see the demonstration com-\\ning off at all today with all these policemen about.”\\n\\n“Don’t shout so, Su-su: there’s a sergeant coming!”\\n\\n“H’m! If you’re so chicken-hearted, Chih-sheng, you shouldn\\'t\\nhave come out with us in the first place—Are you sure you\\ndidn’t get the time and place wrong, Mr. Pai?”\\n\\n“No mistake about it,” answered the young man in the baggy\\ntrousers, “Tsai Chen told me quite clearly that they were going\\nto start from Muddy Bridge, go straight down Nanking Road to\\nthe Bund, then turn into North Szechuan Road, and break up\\nat the range near the park. And it starts at ten, so there’s no\\nhurry, Miss Chang; there’s half an hour to go yet,”\\n\\nThe speaker, Pai Ching, was a fellow-student of Wu Chih-\\nsheng’s. They had been standing there more than five minutes\\nwhen they noticed a couple of hefty-looking fellows—apparently\\nplain-clothes men—coming towards them with a menacing air.\\nSu-su was the first to notice them, and when she did so she\\ntugged at Pai Ching’s coat and started moving away When she\\n\\nreached the side-entrance of the race course, she turned round\\nto the young men following her and said:\\n\\n“Did you see those two men in black gowns? They looked for\\nall the world like twin brothers of that bodyguard of Wu Sun-\\nfu’s!”\\n\\nAs she spoke, she gave a little giggle of delight, for today’s\\nlittle adventure had come as a welcome break in the dull mono-\\ntony of her life, and the appearance of the detectives had cheered\\nher up just when she was getting tired of walking up and down\\nwithout running into anything exciting. When Wu Chih-sheng\\nhad told her the day before that a fellow-student of his by the\\nname of Pai Ching was taking him along to join in the demonstra-\\ntion, she had promised herself plenty of excitement and fun. She\\nhad hardly been able to sleep during the night, and early in\\nthe morning she had dashed round to the college to fetch Wu\\nChih-sheng and his friend. In the matter of enthusiasm, she\\nleft them far behind.\\n\\nWhen Wu Chih-sheng and Pai Ching turned round to look,\\nthe two men in black had disappeared. A red police van drew\\nup and stopped nearby, but it soon drove off again, its horn blar-\\ning hideously.\\n\\n“That’s the van they take them away in,” Pai Ching told\\nChang Su-su, and his face took on a more serious expression.\\nShe smiled, but said nothing, for she was absorbed in watching\\nthe crowds milling round at the corner of Nanking Road and\\nTibet Road. She felt sure that there must be quite a lot of peo-\\nple among the crowd who were only waiting for the signal to\\nbegin the demonstration, and her face became flushed as she\\nfelt a wave of excitement rising inside her.\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng was also gazing all round him, puzzled that\\nhe did not see any of his fellow-students or acquaintances in\\nthe crowd. He looked up at the clock above the grandstand\\nand saw that it was still only twenty minutes to ten. Feeling\\nsuddenly hungry, he turned to Pai Ching and was going to sug-\\ngest that they go for a snack first, but he thought better of it\\nand said instead, “I wonder what’s happening at the front. Have\\nyou heard from your family lately?”\\n\\n“So far as I can see, it’s a case of ‘when Greek meets Greek.’\\nMy home town’s been bombed flat and my people have gone to\\nPengpu. These blasted warlords—”\\n\\nThe rest of what he said was lost as a No. 1 bus pulled up\\nin front of them. Half a dozen passengers got off and a handful\\nof people waiting at the stop got on. When the bus moved off,\\nthe three of them were left standing alone there. Just then a\\nSikh policeman came up to them, tapped Wu Chih-sheng on the\\nshoulder with his truncheon and told them to “Move along\\nthere!’ They moved along. Back past the New World Restau-\\nrant they went, then turned down along Tibet Road.\\n\\nThis time the road looked quite different. Four mounted\\npolicemen were strung out across the road, holding on to their\\nsaddles with one hand while they turned this way and that,\\nwatching for signs of trouble, as if they were prepared to dash\\nforward at the first suggestion of a disturbance. Along the road,\\nthree mounted patrols with two riders apiece were strung out\\nat forty-yard intervals, and were engaged in breaking up knots\\nof bystanders along the sides of the road. A motorcycle carry-\\ning two European sergeants raced past at a frantic speed, fol-\\nlowed by an armoured car which advanced majestically, hooting\\nlike a soul in torment all the way along the road. The crowds\\nalong Tibet Road were now denser than ever and at the corners\\nof the five side-streets which formed right angles with Tibet\\nRoad the crowds were surging this way and that like the tail-\\nrace of a millstream. Chinese, European and Indian patrols\\nwheeled round and round, brandishing their truncheons and re-\\nvolvers in a desperate effort to keep back the crowds, which\\nwere already breaking through the cordon here and there.\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng, Pai Ching, and Chang Su-su now found it\\nimpossible to stand still at any one spot without being moved\\non by the police, so they decided to move farther down the road.\\nAs they were passing a leather-goods shop, a man of about thirty\\nin European clothes dashed up and grasped Wu Chih-sheng by\\nthe shoulder.\\n\\n“Hey! Chih-sheng!” he shouted. “Don’t go that way! It’s\\ndangerous!”\\n\\nThis was Ko Chung-mou, a friend of Chiu Chun, the lawyer.\\nHe was a newspaper reporter and also a frequent visitor to Wu\\nSun-fu’s house.\\n\\nBefore Wu Chih-sheng could reply, Chang Su-su broke in,\\n“What’s happening down there? Has anyone been arrested?”\\n\\n“Ah, Miss Chang! So you’re here too, eh? Joining in the\\ndemonstration or just out to see the fun? If it’s fun you\\'re after,\\nMiss Chang, I should advise you to get back home as quick as\\nyou can!”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I think you know what I mean. You get people coming to\\na demonstration like this for one of two reasons: either they’re\\nagainst it, or else they’re ardent supporters. People who just\\ncome to watch the fun would be well advised to keep out of it.\\nFrankly, Miss Chang, I don’t think you’re a whole-hearted sup-\\nporter, even though you’re not against it—”\\n\\n“Well, what are you doing here, then, Mr. Ko?” Chang Su-su\\nretorted hastily, looking slightly belligerent. She resented Ko\\nChung-mou’s scornful tone, and his implication that she was a\\nfrail, timid creature. The reporter, however, held up his camera\\nand waved it under her nose.\\n\\n“What am I doing here?” he smiled. “I’m a journalist. Mine’s\\na free profession, and I’m here as an independent observer!”\\n\\nWith a brief nod he was off across the road, swinging his\\ncamera as he went.\\n\\nChang Su-su gave a contemptuous laugh and glanced at Wu\\nChih-sheng and Pai Ching as much as to say: “I suppose you\\nlook down on me because I’m a girl, too! Well, just you wait.\\nT’ll show you what I’m made of!” Just then, a disturbance broke\\nout among a crowd across the road, and police-whistles shrilled\\naround them. Chang Su-su trembled all over with excitement,\\nand, without a word to her two companions, she flew across the\\nroad towards the scene of the disturbance. But before she\\ncould get there, the crowd dispersed before a couple of policemen,\\nwho had appeared among them brandishing their truncheons.\\nThis made Chang Su-su pause, and she stood there hesitantly,\\ncraning her neck to watch. Suddenly, a firecracker went off\\nnearby—the signal to start the demonstration. It was followed\\nimmediately by a chorus of shouting from the crowd, which,\\n\\nthough fairly small at first, was quickly joined by demonstrators\\nrushing up from all sides. Chang Su-su felt a tingle of excite-\\nment, and her heart began thumping wildly. She started for-\\nward mechanically, though in her agitation she did not know\\nquite what to do. Hearing a sudden clatter of hooves bearing\\ndown on her from behind, she ran quickly to the side of the\\nroad in the general stampede. She looked round to see the patrol\\ncharging a knot of demonstrators not far away from her. They\\nscattered, but quickly formed up again and pressed on up the\\nroad, chanting slogans at the top of their voices and scatter-\\ning leaflets as they went. They were mostly students and work-\\ning people. Chang Su-su, her heart pounding with excitement\\nand her cheeks flushed, just stood and laughed. Suddenly a\\nvoice behind her bawled:\\n\\n“Stop the warlords making civil war! Down with—”\\n\\nChang Su-su turned round to look and saw that it was Pai\\nChing. He glanced at her quickly, but did not speak, then darted\\nout to join the ranks of the demonstrators, who were just pass-\\ning by where Chang Su-su was standing. They were being har-\\nried from behind by a large detachment of police on foot, and\\na short distance behind these followed mounted patrols and\\narmoured cars. Chang Su-su was swept along up the road by\\nthe crowds of spectators, only to meet another detachment of\\npolice bearing down on them from the other direction and wield-\\ning their truncheons. The crowd scattered in all directions, and in\\nthe stampede somebody caught Chang Su-su by the hand and led\\nher out of harm’s reach. It was Wu Chih-sheng. He was look-\\ning rather distraught, but managed to smile at her. When they\\nreached the Hsin Hsin Department Store, they saw that the main\\nbody of the demonstrators had forced their way past the junc-\\ntion of Nanking Road and Chekiang Road and had split up into\\nsmall groups. Chang Su-su heaved a sigh of relief, but her ex-\\nhilaration had given way to depression. She was in no mood\\nfor laughing now, and she felt cold down to the tips of her\\nfingers. The demonstrators, now in groups of seven or eight,\\nwere still circling around the blocks dominated by the three big\\ndepartment stores of Nanking Road, shouting slogans. As Chang\\nSu-su and Wu Chih-sheng stood in the crowd milling round in\\nfront of the Hsin Hsin Department Store, a red police van sud-\\n\\ndenly hurtled round the corner from Yunnan Road and stopped\\nright in front of them. Half a dozen policemen jumped out and\\nbegan rounding up the demonstrators there. Panic-stricken,\\nChang Su-su turned and tried to run into the store, but was\\nstopped by a group of salesmen shouting “Keep out!” and clos-\\ning the iron gates. Wu Chih-sheng had already made a dash\\nfor the other side of the road, and Chang Su-su now took the\\nplunge and ran after him. When they reached the pavement on\\nthe opposite side of the road, she grasped his hand again, and\\nfound that both their hands were trembling and clammy.\\n\\nThe ground here was strewn with leaflets, and Wu Chih-sheng\\nand Chang Su-su trampled on them in their flight. The police-\\nwhistles continued to shrill, and the noise made it impossible to\\nhear what the demonstrators were shouting. Wu Chih-sheng and\\nChang Su-su both looked pale and shaken. Seeing the Ta San\\nYuan Restaurant just ahead of them, with its doors still open,\\nthey dived in, just as another wave of shouting rose behind them\\nin the street. Without even a glance over her shoulder, Chang\\nSu-su ran straight up the stairs to the first floor.\\n\\n*\\n\\nThe restaurant was filled to overflowing, and they despaired\\nof ever finding a seat. They had only come in to hide for a\\nwhile, but once in, their appetites were sharpened by the aroma\\nof food. They had to stand in a corner waiting for a vacant\\ntable, disappointed and frowning, until a helpful waiter suggested\\nthat they should share a table with a gentleman who had al-\\nready been there half an hour, not so much eating as reading\\nnewspapers. At first, the customer was apparently unwilling to\\nshare his table, but when Chang Su-su peeped over into his\\ncubicle he saw her, threw aside his newspaper, and stood up,\\nshaking with laughter. It was Fan Po-wen.\\n\\nChang Su-su gave a little cry of surprise when she saw who\\nit was, then burst out laughing with him.\\n\\n“So it’s you, is it?” she cried. “And on your own, too! What\\nare you hiding in here for?”\\n\\n“Let me guess,” put in Wu Chih-sheng, sitting down on Fan\\nPo-wen’s left. “You’re not waiting for anybody, and you don’t\\nseem to be here for the benefit of your stomach, so you must\\n\\nbe collecting material for your poems——in other words, to see\\nthe demonstration!”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he picked up the newspapers and found they con-\\nsisted of a complete set of that morning’s tabloids.\\n\\nWith an indignant glance at Wu Chih-sheng, Fan Po-wen\\nturned to Chang Su-su:\\n\\n“It’s a good subject, but this time they bungled it. I’ve seen\\npractically all of it from beginning to end. By the way, what do\\nyou think of my grandstand view from here? You can see\\neverything from Muddy Bridge at one end to the Sunrise Tea-\\nHouse at the other. Though as a poet I must say again that they\\nbungled the demonstration this time, and I couldn’t very well\\nleave them out and only describe the policemen prancing around\\nlike a lot of monkeys and the armoured cars crawling along like\\ngreat tortoises. No, I’m not a cringing poetaster licking the\\nhand of authority: I think one should also paint the other side\\nof the picture. In that immortal epic, the Iliad, Homer may\\nsing the praises of the heroes on the Greek side, but he doesn’t\\nforget a word of praise for the brave Hector. The only trouble\\nwith today’s performance was that the demonstrators just weren’t\\nup to scratch.—To tell the truth, Su-su, it wasn’t that that I\\neame here for today, but for something else—though I was\\ndisappointed in that, as well!”\\n\\n“Also connected with getting inspiration for your poetry?”\\nasked Chang Su-su rather absently, at the same time running\\nher little finger down the menu and indicating to the waiter\\nwhat she wanted. Fan Po-wen blushed, sighed, and nodded re-\\nluctantly, but said nothing. He wanted to have his secret dragged\\nout of him, rather than tell it voluntarily, but this was too subtle\\nfor Chang Su-su, who always abandoned an unanswered ques-\\ntion, as the rules of social etiquette demanded. Besides, she\\nwas eager to talk about the demonstration, in which she had, in\\na way, taken part in person. But Wu Chih-sheng, who knew\\nFan Po-wen inside out, threw aside his newspaper and clapped\\nhim on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Come on, out with it, poet!” he growled with mock severity.\\n“What are you skulking in here for on your own?”\\n\\nFan Po-wen, looking ill at ease, shrugged his shoulders and\\ngave a hollow laugh. Chang Su-su also laughed, though rather\\n\\nout of sympathy for the cornered poet than anything. She was\\njust going to change the subject in an effort to save his face,\\nwhen she heard a tap on the partition, followed by the sound of\\na woman giggling in the next cubicle. Then a voice asked:\\n\\n“Ts that you, Su-su?”\\n\\nThere was no mistaking Lin Pei-shan’s voice. Fan Po-wen\\nblushed more furiously than ever and Wu Chih-sheng roared with\\nlaughter.\\n\\nChang Su-su seemed to realize what it was all about, for she\\nglanced quickly at Fan Po-wen, and slipped out of the cubicle.\\nIn a moment or two she came back hand in hand with Lin Pei-\\nshan, followed by Tu Hsin-to, a stick hanging from his arm and\\na straw hat in his hand.\\n\\nNo sooner had they come in than Lin Pei-shan rested her head\\nlanguidly on Chang Su-su’s shoulder and, looking at Fan Po-\\nwen out of the corner of her eye from behind Chang Su-su’s\\nloose, bobbed hair, she began teasing him.\\n\\n“Po-wen, I’d like to give you a present: a packet of visiting\\ncards printed like this: ‘Fan Po-wen. Pastoral poet and detec-\\ntive-story writer. How would that be?”\\n\\nShe giggled, and they all burst out laughing. Fan Po-wen\\njoined in the laugh, and immediately seemed more cheerful. He\\nbowed slightly to Lin Pei-shan, at the same time placing his\\nright hand flat on his chest in a Buddhist monk’s salute. He\\nthen shook hands with Tu Hsin-to and asked with a smile:\\n\\n“and what about you, Hsin-to? What are you going to give\\nme?”\\n\\n“Me?—Oh, I\\'ll give you a copy of Shakespeare’s masterpiece,\\nLove’s Labour’s Lost,” Tu Hsin-to answered calmly, with a supe-\\nrior smile. He had changed back into Chinese dress today, and\\nhis lean frame was draped in a long, navy-blue flannel gown,\\ngiving him the air of a worthy descendant of some famous\\nscholar. Fan Po-wen winced at this sly dig, but he covered up\\nhis annoyance with a smile, as if he were grateful for the offer,\\nand said:\\n\\n“well, let’s hope I don’t get hold of the wrong partner in our\\nmasquerade.”\\n\\n“Good for you! but I don’t mind telling you that as a newcomer\\nI can’t yet imagine myself taking part in your masquerade!”\\n\\nAt this, the two of them shared a knowing laugh. By now,\\nLin Pei-shan and Chang Su-su were engaged in an animated con-\\nversation, while Wu Chih-sheng sat opposite them and nodded\\nhis confirmation from time to time. Chang Su-su was telling\\nLin Pei-shan how she had taken part in the demonstration and\\nof the narrow escapes she had had. She had by now forgotten\\nall about her trembling, clammy hands and her panic at the\\ntime, and when she looked back on it all, all she could remember\\nwas how the main body of the demonstrators had withstood the\\nattempts of the mounted police patrols to disperse them, and\\nhow they had eventually broken through the police cordon and\\nmarched straight up Nanking Road. She told Lin Pei-shan how\\nher enthusiasm had been fired so that she jeered at the charging\\npatrols, regardless of her personal safety, as they swept down\\nupon her. As she spoke, her face became flushed again, her\\neyes gleamed with excitement, and the more she went on, the\\nmore fluent and unrestrained she became. Lin Pei-shan listened\\nwide-eyed, her hand gripping Chang Su-su’s. Suddenly she in-\\nterrupted, her voice shrill with excitement:\\n\\n“Oh, Su-su! How awful! To think of all those Sikhs on those\\nhuge horses of theirs charging up behind you! Ugh! Chih-sheng,\\ndid you see that horse brush past Su-su’s head, and almost knock\\nher over and trample on her? Oh, my dear!”\\n\\nWu Chih-sheng nodded and laughed excitedly.\\n\\nBut Chang Su-su did not share his amusement. Her expres-\\nsion was grave now as she borrowed the tiny lace handkerchief\\nwhich Lin Pei-shan was wearing for ornament in her lapel, and\\ndabbed at her forehead with it. She was about to go on when\\nLin Pei-shan grasped both her hands and exclaimed:\\n\\n“And your friend actually shouted a slogan, Su-su! Well!\\nAnd was it then that the policemen chased you up to the Hsin\\nHsin Department Store? And did they arrest your friend then?”\\n\\nAs she said this, Lin Pei-shan turned to Wu Chih-sheng, who,\\nnot having heard properly what it was all about, nodded me-\\nchanically. Chang Su-su did not know what had happened to\\nPai Ching, but when she saw Wu Chih-sheng nod in agreement\\nwith the suggestion that he had been arrested, she jumped up\\nwith a sudden ery, flung her arms round Lin Pei-shan’s neck\\nand shook her unceremoniously,\\n\\n“So that’s one young man sacrificed for the cause!” she exulted.\\n“But he’s only one—one that we saw with our own eyes, and\\none that we knew! Oh, what a man—what a hero! To have\\nbroken through a cordon of policemen and mounted patrols and\\narmoured cars! Oh, I shall never, never be able to forget this\\nday!”\\n\\n“TI saw two or three men arrested, too,” Fan Po-wen told Tu\\nHsin-to with an inexplicable sigh, “and I’m perfectly certain\\nthat one of them was only an innocent passer-by.”\\n\\nThe latter nodded without emotion and made no comment. Fan\\nPo-wen glanced over his shoulder at Chang Su-su, and when\\nhe saw what a state of excitement she had worked herself up into,\\nhe could not restrain another sigh. He said loudly:\\n\\n“Rverything’s going downhill! Even the mass movement has\\ndegenerated to an unbelievable extent! Five years ago I took\\npart in the famous Thirtieth of May demonstration, and on that\\nday—well, ‘the world is world, and man is man!\\'—on that day,\\nI tell you, masses occupied Nanking Road all day long! Now\\nthat was something like a demonstration! But today, all they\\ndid was to break through the cordon! Small beer for anyone\\nwho’s been through the real thing! Frankly, I thought today’s\\naffair rather a bore.”\\n\\nChang Su-su and Lin Pei-shan turned to stare at Fan Po-wen\\nin astonishment. Coming into the world later than Fan Po-wen,\\nthey had not witnessed the actual incident themselves, and they\\ncould only gape tongue-tied at Fan Po-wen’s blasé judgement,\\nnot knowing whether to believe him or not. Their astonishment\\nonly served to make Fan Po-wen feel all the more pleased with\\nhimself. He sat staring out of the window at the sky, apparently\\nengrossed in intoxicating memories of the stirring deeds of five\\nyears ago, until a sudden splutter of cynical laughter behind him\\nbrought him back to earth. Wu Chih-sheng had been listening\\nto him in silence, but could now contain himself no longer.\\n\\n“T thoroughly agree with you when you say that everything’s\\ndegenerated, Po-wen—just look at yourself, for instance! Five\\nyears ago, you took part in the demonstration, but what are you\\ndoing today? You sit up here in a restaurant looking on with\\na jaundiced eye like Nero fiddling while Rome burned!”\\n\\nFan Po-wen turned slowly and smiled wanly at Wu Chih-\\nsheng with apparent unconcern, then cast a hopeful glance at\\nChang Su-su and Lin Pei-shan as much as to say: At least\\nyou two believe me, don’t you? But they said nothing: they just\\nsmiled knowingly at each other. He was beginning to feel rather\\nembarrassed, when Tu Hsin-to came to his rescue.\\n\\n“What’s so wonderful about occupying Nanking Road for a\\nwhole day, anyway? That sort of thing’s always happening\\nabroad. Townspeople are very restless and they’re always mak-\\ning trouble—”\\n\\n“You call it making trouble, do you?” Chang Su-su protested\\nindignantly, at the same time shaking Lin Pei-shan’s shoulder\\nvigorously. Unabashed, Tu Hsin-to answered in a cool, firm\\nvoice:\\n\\n“Yes, that’s just what I do call it: making trouble. Just go\\nthrough all the history books—Chinese and foreign, ancient and\\nmodern—and you won’t find a single country making herself\\nwealthy and strong by such methods as agitation and demonstra-\\ntion. They’re nothing but the acts of ignorant people guided by\\nimpulses—destructive, not constructive, acts.”\\n\\n“Then perhaps you\\'ll be good enough to tell us what acts are\\nconstructive, and not destructive,” Wu Chih-sheng hastened to\\nask before Chang Su-su could say anything, tugging at her\\nwrist as he spoke. Instead of replying, Tu Hsin-to smiled and\\nbegan quietly whistling the Marseillaise. Fan Po-wen blinked\\nin surprise, and Lin Pei-shan tittered. Chang Su-su puffed out\\nher cheeks and turned to Wu Chih-sheng:\\n\\n“There’s no need to ask him that—he’ll tell you the government\\nshould use the mailed fist, the same as his uncle Tu Hsueh-shih\\nis always telling us!”\\n\\n“That’s just where you’re wrong, Miss Chang,” said Tu Hsin-\\nto, the smile never leaving his lips. “My contention is that\\nthere’s no ruling a country like this with any sort of policy.”\\n\\nThis proposition was greeted with an immediate outcry of pro-\\ntest from Chang Su-su and Wu Chih-sheng. Fan Po-wen, on the\\nother hand, reached out and patted Tu Hsin-to on the back, then\\ngave the “thumbs up” sign, flourishing his hand under Tu Hsin-\\nto’s nose as he did so. Just at that moment the waiter came\\nin with their order, and as Fan Po-wen’s arm swung out it\\n\\nalmost knocked the food out of his hands. This was too much\\nfor Lin Pei-shan, whose stified amusement now gave way to\\nshrieks of laughter as she supported herself on her chair with\\none hand and held her side with the other.\\n\\n“Po-wen, you—” Chang Su-su began, intending to scold Fan\\nPo-wen, but her scow] changed to a smile as she went on:\\n\\n“Hsin-to, you and your uncle Hsueh-shih make a perfect pair.\\nYou\\'re too cold and he’s too hot, so that your family are the\\nproud possessors of one of each kind: one hot and one cold!”\\n\\n“Thanks for the compliment,” said Tu Hsin-to. “Since it’s\\nsummer at the moment, it’s much better to keep cool.— Well,\\nlet’s have some pastries—that’s one thing I do like hot!”\\n\\nHe gave a dry laugh, then sat down and started on the pastries.\\nAs if transferring her exasperation to the food, she took a pastry\\nand bit viciously into it, then turned angrily to Fan Po-wen:\\n\\n“and what about you? I suppose you’re just lukewarm?”\\n\\n“Fte’ll make poetry out of anything,” put in Wu Chih-sheng,\\nseeing an opportunity of making fun of Fan Po-wen. “Warmth,\\ncoldness, arrests, bloodshed—all’s grist to his mill!”\\n\\nActually, he was even more annoyed with Tu Hsin-to than\\nwith Fan Po-wen, but he intended this sally against Fan as an\\nindirect attack on Tu. Anyway, he thought, they were both\\ntarred with the same brush, and differed only in degree. He\\ncould not remember when he had come to this conclusion, but\\nthe conviction had steadily grown as their competition for Lin\\nPei-shan had become increasingly obvious. Having delivered\\nhis dig at Fan Po-wen, he glanced at Tu Hsin-to and then Lin\\nPei-shan. Tu Hsin-to, still impassive and undisturbed, chewed\\nsilently and meditatively; Lin Pei-shan, leaning against the back\\nof Chang Su-su’s chair, was absorbed in her own thoughts.\\n\\nIgnoring Wu Chih-sheng’s taunt, Fan Po-wen went and sat be-\\nside Chang Su-su. Suddenly he took a deep breath and mut-\\ntered, “I become hot at the touch of something hot, but I don’t\\nnecessarily become cold at the touch of something cold. I’m\\nnot averse to a bit of leg-pulling, but deep down inside me I’m\\nactually quite serious. I’ve always wanted to do something\\nreally serious—something to shake me out of the rut.—By the\\nway, why didn’t you call for me this morning? Don’t tell me\\n\\nyou’d decided I wouldn’t go with you!—Oh, and that friend of\\nyours that was probably arrested—I’d like to get to know him.”\\n\\nChang Su-su smiled and took another dumpling as she an-\\nswered.\\n\\n“You should have told me beforehand that you wanted to come\\nalong? How was I to know you’d want to? As a matter of\\nfact—”\\n\\nShe paused and looked quickly round at Lin Pei-shan who\\nwas still slumped sideways against the back of her chair gazing\\nblankly into space. Chang Su-su laughed mischievously and was\\ngoing to make a further sarcastic remark, when she noticed that\\nLin Pei-shan was blushing furiously. This made Chang Su-su\\nlaugh all the louder. At this juncture, Tu Hsin-to picked up a\\nchopstick and began tapping it on the table. A faint, cynical\\nsmile lingered round his lips as he burst into an ancient poem:\\n\\nOur youth like lightning flashes by,\\nLike wind time passes soon;\\n\\nOn grass yet green the frost is white;\\nWith sunset comes the moon.\\n\\nBlack hair fades with the fading year,\\nAnd soon turn grey it must;\\n\\nThe noble change to storks and apes,\\nThe mean to fleas and dust.\\n\\nChang Su-su frowned at this and snorted. As she did so, the\\ndoor of the cubicle swung open, and there appeared in the door-\\nway a peering pair of spectacles perched on a large, prominent\\nnose. The spectacles were as thick as the bottoms of tumblers,\\nand the quaintly questing head belonged to Li Yu-ting. He was\\napparently still trying to make out how many people were there\\nand who they were. His sudden appearance took Chang Su-su\\nunawares, and she fidgeted uneasily. When Tu Hsin-to saw him\\nhe put down the chopstick and rose to greet him, at the same\\ntime casting a meaningful glance at Chang Su-su.\\n\\n“What brings you here, Professor Li?” he asked. “Have vou\\nbeen here long?—-Perhaps you’re taking lessons in detective-story\\nwriting from Fan Po-wen?”\\n\\n“You\\'re asking for it, Hsin-to!” said Fan Po-wen, shooting Tu\\nHsin-to a reproachful look. He noticed that Chang Su-su was\\n\\nlooking rather ill at ease now that Li Yu-ting had appeared.\\nUnconscious of all this, the short-sighted professor groped his\\nway across to the table and beamed at the others.\\n\\n“Ah, so there are five of you! All taking refuge in here, eh?\\nThe streets are just packed—and the police are being rather\\nrough. And what with my bad eyesight, I had rather a job\\nmaking my way through the crowds. In fact, I had a narrowish\\nescape a moment ago—”\\n\\n“Eh? D’you mean to say the demonstration is still on?” asked\\nWu Chih-sheng hastily through a mouthful of dumpling.\\n\\n“Yes, it is, indeed. I was going along Tung Hsin Bridge Street\\nin a rickshaw, when I ran into a procession of several hundred\\npeople, armed with bottles and stones, fighting with the police.\\nWhile I was there somebody must have thrown some leaflets\\ninto my rickshaw—I was too busy telling the rickshaw boy to\\nget a move on to notice at the time. Just as we were coming\\ninto Ta Hsin Street, we ran into another lot of policemen round-\\ning up demonstrators. They happened to see the leaflets on me,\\nand stopped me on the spot. I showed them my card, but they\\nstill wouldn’t let me go. I appealed to a sergeant, but that wasn’t\\nany use, either. In the end they took me off to the police station\\n—rickshaw and rickshaw boy as well. They treated me very well\\nat the station, and after some explanation they soon let me go\\nagain. Even now, the atmosphere in Nanking Road’s still very\\ntense—big crowds everywhere, milling round and round. And all\\nthe big shops are bolted and barred—”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting suddenly broke off, whereupon Fan Po-wen threw\\nback his head and roared with laughter, pointing at Wu Chih-\\nsheng with one hand and at Chang Su-su with the other. He\\nwas just going to regale Li Yu-ting with an account of their\\n“adventures” in the demonstration, enlivening it with a few\\nbrilliant shafts of wit which he had just thought up, when a\\nsudden uproar was heard in the street just under their window,\\nand there was a rush of feet as people in the restaurant stam-\\npeded to the head of the stairs. Fan Po-wen, pale and speechless\\nwith fright, ducked his head as if he was going to dive under\\nthe table, while Chang Su-su and Wu Chih-sheng rushed to the\\nwindow to see what was happening. Li Yu-ting stood there\\n\\nwringing his hands in agitation, and Lin Pei-shan cowered in\\nthe corner, her eyes and mouth wide with fear.\\n\\nOnly Tu Hsin-to seemed unperturbed; though the colour had\\nleft his cheeks, he still managed to force a smile to his lips.\\n\\n“Huh! Not worth going to look—it’s all over now,” said Chang\\nSu-su disappointedly as she came back from the window. When\\nshe looked round and saw the agitated expression on Lin Pei-\\nshan’s face, she could not help laughing at her. Lin Pei-shan\\npeered apprehensively around and asked:\\n\\n“What happened? Oh, Su-su! Weren’t you afraid of being\\nhit by a stray bullet?”\\n\\nChang Su-su shook her head, but it was not clear whether this\\nmeant she was not afraid of stray bullets, or whether it meant\\nshe did not know what all the noise in the street had been about.\\nStill in need of reassurance, Lin Pei-shan glanced at Tu Hsin-to\\ninquiringly. She had noticed just now that he seemed perfectly\\ncalm as if he had known all along that everything would be\\nall right.\\n\\n“Who cares what happened, anyway?” exclaimed Tu Hsin-to\\nwith an air of utter nonchalance and a sidelong glance at the\\ntwo girls. “In any case, it couldn’t be serious. I’ve every con-\\nfidence in the ability of the foreigners to keep order! As a\\nmatter of fact, I don’t see why the authorities in the settlement\\nshould get in such a stew and take such strict precautions—they\\nonly cause a panic doing that.”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting shook his head as he listened to Tu Hsin-to. He\\nwas more certain than ever now that Tu Hsin-to was nothing\\nmore than a frivolous young hedonist. Unable to restrain him-\\nself any longer, he took a step forward and rasped, “Don’t be too\\noptimistic! At this moment Shanghai’s heading for a crisis, too.\\nJust look at the way rice has gone up to twenty dollars a picul\\nand the way prices in general are shooting up. Since March\\nthere’s been one strike after another—the trams, the buses, the\\ncotton mills. They say the Communists are planning a general\\nstrike for some time in May—”\\n\\n“Well, have they done it? Today is May the thirtieth, isn’t\\nit?”\\n\\n“Yes, I suppose May is practically over—but that doesn’t mean\\nto say that the danger of a crisis has passed! In the North, the\\n\\nwar is getting bloodier and bloodier, and in the South, Chang\\nFa-kuei’s Kwangsi Army is marching on Hunan Province; the\\nwhole country will soon be drawn into the maelstrom of civil\\nwar. Everywhere the peasants are rioting, and there’s no tell-\\ning how many groups of bandits are taking advantage of the\\nsituation to give themselves out as Communists and hoist the\\nred flag. Only a few days ago something happened in your part\\nof the country: out of one battalion of the local garrison two\\ncompanies mutinied and went over to the Communists. The\\nCommunists will expand their activities every day that the\\ncivil war drags on. June and July will be worse still, so the\\nworst is yet to come—”\\n\\n“But Shanghai—”\\n\\n“ven in Shanghai the situation is getting worse day by day.\\nOnly these last few days they discovered that Communists had\\ninfiltrated into units stationed around Shanghai, and they even\\nfound Communist leaflets and groups in the city garrison itself.\\nThey say that quite a large proportion of the troops are un-\\nreliable now. Even the workers at the arsenal have got a secret\\norganization. And this morning, despite all the precautions of\\nthe Settlement police, the workers and students held the demon-\\nstration just the same and even broke through the police cordon.\\nHow can you blame the Settlement authorities for ‘getting in a\\nstew’ about it?”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting’s voice gradually dropped lower and lower as he\\nspoke, but his words were like thunder in the ears of his lis-\\nteners. Tu Hsin-to’s frown deepened, but he said nothing. Chang\\nSu-su’s face was flushed and her eyes alight with excitement.\\nWu Chih-sheng tugged at Fan Po-wen’s jacket and said half\\nin jest and half in earnest:\\n\\n“Just wait, Po-wen! It won’t be long now before you have\\nsomething to write about!”\\n\\nFan Po-wen nodded quite seriously, then turned to Li Yu-ting;\\nhe was just going to say something, when Lin Pei-shan cut him\\nshort, “Anyway, Shanghai should be safe enough. We can al-\\nways pop across into the International Settlement or the French\\nConcession!”\\n\\nBefore Li Yu-ting had time to reply, Tu Hsin-to put in, “Oh,\\nyes, Shanghai is safe for one or two days at least yet, perhaps\\n\\nfor another week, another month, or two months, even. Apart\\nfrom Shanghai, a few other large ports like Tientsin, Hankow,\\nCanton, Macao and so on are also safe for a few months yet.\\nAnd after that we have Japan, France and America that are even\\nsafer. Yes, there are still plenty of places in the world safe\\nfor our leisure and pleasure. Why should we worry about it?”\\n\\nRelieved by his assurances, Lin Pei-shan giggled. She was a\\ngay, lively girl, and did not see why she should allow the pros-\\npect of unknown dangers looming ahead stop her from enjoying\\nherself while she could. Yet the others apparently felt quite\\ndifferently about it: Li Yu-ting gazed in amazement at Tu Hsin-\\nto for a while, then looked at Wu Chih-sheng, then at Fan Po-\\nwen. He seemed to be looking for someone to join him in a\\nserious conversation. At length, he went on with a sigh:\\n\\n“If the war goes on and on like this, and if the politicians,\\nthe businessmen and the students here at home all split up into\\nquarrelling groups and factions, like the people fighting at the\\nfront, I can see the total collapse of the nation just round the\\ncorner. When the Tsarists were removed from power, they\\ncould flee the country and live abroad, but when our turn comes,\\nwe shan’t be so lucky, I fear, because by that time revolutions\\nwill be breaking out all over the world, and the propertied\\nclasses in every country—”\\n\\nHe broke off and bent his head in thought, heart-broken be-\\ncause the government, the party leaders, and the heads of so-\\nciety could not sink their differences and stop squabbling among\\nthemselves. This thing he had on hand now, for instance: Wu\\nSun-fu had entrusted him with the job of going along and nego-\\ntiating with Chao Po-tao on his behalf—patching up a quarrel\\nbetween them, actually. Ever since he had run into the demon-\\nstration in Tung Hsin Bridge Street, he had been turning a prov-\\nerb over in his mind: “A powerful enemy is not so much to\\nbe feared as dissension in one’s own camp.” What grieved him\\nnow was to see the enemy’s inroads widening and deepening the\\nsplit in his own camp.\\n\\nHe was startled abruptly out of his gloomy musings by a laugh.\\nIt was Tu Hsin-to, leaning against the doorpost, a cynical smile\\non his lips. When Li Yu-ting looked round, he began reciting\\na poem quietly as if to himself:\\n\\nMake merry, and take no heed for the morrow:\\nWith women and wine forget your sorrow,\\nDrown your cares in sparkling wine,\\nAnd in soft arms yourself entwine.\\n\\nThen he suddenly raised his voice: “I say, everybody, why\\ndo we have to bury ourselves in this god-forsaken hole on such\\na glorious day? I know of a wonderful new pleasure-garden run\\nby a White Russian émigré—Rio Rita’s. They’ve got good wine\\nand good music, and there are White Russian princesses, princes’\\ndaughters, imperial concubines and ladies-in-waiting to dance\\nattendance on you. Green, shady trees and lawns as smooth\\nas velvet. And then there’s a little lake for boating... ah,\\njt reminds me of the happy hours I spent on the banks of the\\nSeine ... lily-white bosoms and thighs... and the burning\\npassions of the French girls!”\\n\\nAs he said this, he turned and took his hat and stick from a\\nhook on the partition. He seemed surprised that his suggestion\\nbrought no response from the others. Nevertheless he smiled\\ncalmly as he went across to Lin Pei-shan, held out his hand to\\nher, and said with a slight bow:\\n\\n“Miss Lin, if you were going home, perhaps Miss Chang would\\ngo with you for company—”\\n\\nWith a puzzled smile, Lin Pei-shan darted a glance at Chang\\nSu-su and the others, then, as if she had made up her mind, she\\nnodded and departed arm in arm with Tu Hsin-to.\\n\\nAt this Wu Chih-sheng gave Fan Po-wen a meaning look, but\\nthe poet passed it off with a careless laugh and proceeded to take\\nit out on Li Yu-ting:\\n\\n“You may be a professor, Yu-ting, but you do talk a lot of rot!\\nAll your preaching and theorizing runs off Tu Hsin-to like water\\noff a duck’s back—it just makes him all the more determined to\\nenjoy himself while he can. ‘Tonight we have wine, so tonight\\nwe get drunk! He doesn’t give two hoots for all your weeping\\nand wailing and gnashing of teeth!”\\n\\n“Oh, give it a rest!” exclaimed Chang Su-su. “Let’s go up\\nto North Szechuan Road. Chih-sheng, didn’t Pai Ching say the\\nprocession would break up somewhere around there?”\\n\\nSo saying, she threw a note on the table and turned to go,\\nfollowed by Wu Chih-sheng. Fan Po-wen hesitated a second,\\n\\nthen shouted “Just a minute,” and, with a fleeting smile at Li\\nYu-ting, ran down the stairs after them.\\n\\nLeft alone in the cubicle, Li Yu-ting leaned out of the window\\nand strained his eyes to see what was happening in the street.\\nThe crowds had begun to melt away and he could see the three\\nof them walking abreast with Chang Su-su in the middle, chat-\\nting and gesticulating gaily. A doubt assailed his mind as he\\nwatched them out of sight: What were they going to North Sze-\\nchuan Road for?—Although he had not quite caught Chang Su-\\nsu’s last few words, he had a shrewd idea of her intentions from\\nher expression; in any case, he was well enough acquainted with\\nher temperament and ideas to be able to guess. And isn’t this\\njust another indication of the inevitable disintegration of the pres-\\nent time? With this pessimistic thought, and a growing sense\\nof despondency, he shook his head, and, with one last look down\\ninto the street, he made his way out of the restaurant.\\n\\n*\\n\\nOnce out in the street, he walked westward. Arriving at the\\nHua An Building, he glanced at his wrist watch: half past ten.\\nHe went in and took the lift to the fourth floor. In the corridor\\nhe scribbled a few words on his card and gave it to a page.\\nAfter a considerable wait, the white-liveried page returned and\\nshowed him to a luxurious suite—two rooms and a bathroom—\\nlooking out over the race course. The bathroom door stood ajar,\\nand the other two rooms were filled with scent-laden steam.\\nSince his glasses had immediately misted over, Li Yu-ting saw\\neverything through a white haze. Suddenly, he seemed to see\\nthe blurred outline of a white figure flash past him and disappear\\ninto the bedroom, leaving behind a trail of heady perfume and\\nthe echo of a woman’s silvery laughter. Li Yu-ting quickly wiped\\nhis glasses with his finger and peered round again. He saw Chao\\nPo-tao curled up on his side on a sofa, wearing a cream-coloured\\nflannel bathrobe, his hairy legs propped up on one arm of the\\nsofa. He was, of course, resting after a bath.\\n\\nChao Po-tao did not get up: he just nodded casually, vaguely\\nwaved a hand at Li Yu-ting, and then turned his head and called\\ntowards the bedroom:\\n\\n“Yu-ying! Come on out! Come and meet Mr. Li here. He’s\\nnear-sighted, and I don’t think he saw you when you went past\\n\\nhim just now.—No, you needn’t dress up: come out just as you\\nare.”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting gaped in wonder, wondering what the purpose of\\nthis move was. Almost immediately, the woman appeared in a\\nhaze of perfume, giggling and swaying her hips. A large, snowy\\nbath-towel was draped round her like a monk’s robe, and as she\\ntripped across the room with her shoulders thrown back, her\\nunusually prominent breasts could be seen bobbing up and down\\nbeneath the towel. Her face was small and oval, and her vivid\\nlips were curved in a persistent smile. Glancing sharply at Li\\nYu-ting with a faint grin, Chao Po-tao reached out and pinched\\nthe woman’s plump seat.\\n\\n“Ouch!” she yelped coquettishly. Chao Po-tao laughed bois-\\nterously and touched her thigh so that she spun round to avoid\\nhim. He made her twirl round once again, then shoved her\\nroughly away and grunted:\\n\\n“That’s enough! Now go back and get dressed—and shut the\\ndoor behind you!”\\n\\nIt was as if he had displayed his treasure for a moment and\\nthen quickly locked it away in its casket again. When she had\\ngone, he turned to Li Yu-ting:\\n\\n“why! What’s the matter with you, Yu-ting? You’re blush-\\ning! Look at yourself in the mirror! Ha! Ha! You\\'re a proper\\ngreenhorn, aren’t you! They say I’m fond of the women: yes,\\nI certainly do, and I make no secret of it. Hf I do anything,\\nI do it straight out. I don’t like having people guessing about\\nme as if I were not an ordinary human being but a fiend —You\\nyourself, for instance: the moment you came in just now, you\\nsaw I had a woman here, but because of your bad eyesight you\\ncouldn’t quite see her properly. That set you guessing—I could\\nsee it. But now you’ve had a good look at her, and you may\\neven have recognized her. Not bad, eh? She has the figure and\\nskin of a European!”\\n\\nWith this, Chao Po-tao suddenly swung his feet to the floor\\nand stood up. He took a cigar from the case on the table and\\nstuck it between his teeth, then slid the cigar-case towards Li\\nYu-ting with a gesture of invitation to help himself. He settled\\nhimself on the sofa again, propped up his legs, slowly struck a\\nmatch, and began lighting his cigar. He looked as if he had not\\n\\na care in the world and was now settling down for a good loaf.\\nInstead of taking a cigar, Li Yu-ting ran his fingers lightly and\\nabsently along the edge of the cigar-case: he was wrestling with\\nthe problem of how to carry out the task entrusted to him by\\nWu Sun-fu without bungling and at the same time without offend-\\ning Chao Po-tao. He was waiting for Chao Po-tao to broach the\\nsubject first, for he wanted to avoid giving the impression that\\nhe had been specially sent as a negotiator, and he did not want\\nto appear to be one of the “Wu clique.” But Chao Po-tao smoked\\non without a word and hardly glanced at Li Yu-ting. After five\\nminutes like this, Li Yu-ting could hold out no longer, and\\ndecided to put out a feeler.\\n\\n“Did you see Sun-fu yesterday, Mr. Chao?”\\n\\nChao Po-tao shook his head and took the cigar out of his\\nmouth as if he was going to speak at last. But, after flicking\\noff the ash, he put it back into his mouth.\\n\\n“Sun-iu’s home town’s been plundered by the bandits,” Li Yu-\\nting went on, “and he’s lost quite a bit there, so of course he’s\\nnot in a very good mood—in fact, he gets quite short-tempered\\nsometimes.—For example, there are a couple of things he can’t\\nagree with you about: the Exchange settlement and the loan to\\nChu Yin-chiu. As a matter of fact... .”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting held on to the “fact” while he watched Chao Po-\\ntao’s expression closely. He had intended to say “As a matter\\nof fact, this is a mere trifle” but thought better of it. He decided\\nto change it to “As a matter of fact, we can easily find a solu-\\ntion,” but before he could get the words out of his mouth, Chao\\nPo-tao broke in.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s that that’s upsetting him, is it? Ah, well, we can\\neasily find a way round that. But tell me, Yu-ting, have you\\ncome here to talk terms with me on behalf of Wu Sun-fu, or\\njust to pump me?”\\n\\nThis sudden blow, straight from the shoulder, caught Li Yu-\\nting off his guard. True, he had Wu Sun-fu’s terms with him\\nand also the intention of sounding Chao Po-tao; but now that\\nChao Po-tao had called his bluff, he was in a quandary how to\\nproceed. Not wishing to be caught between two fires, he decided\\nit would be in his best interests to tread warily and try to please\\n\\nboth of them. He accordingly smiled and hastened to assure\\nChao Po-tao.\\n\\n“Oh, no! Far from it! You and Wu Sun-fu are old friends;\\nif you had anything to discuss you could do it yourselves with-\\nout going through me—”\\n\\n“Of course!” interrupted Chao Po-tao, fixing Li Yu-ting with\\na sharp look. “From which we may assume that you’re here to\\npump me! All right, then, I\\'ll be quite frank with you. I like\\nto do things the straightforward way!”\\n\\n“J quite agree, Mr. Chao; the straightforward way\\'s always the\\nbest,” replied Li Yu-ting. Cornered as he was, there was not\\nmuch else he could say. Much as he resented Chao Po-tao’s\\nmerciless directness, he realized it would be the height of folly\\nfor him to attempt any sort of double-dealing with a man like\\nthis. He would have to change his tactics. But Chao Po-tao,\\nas if he had read Li Yu-ting’s thoughts, threw back his head and\\nlaughed. He stood up and clapped Li Yu-ting on the shoulder.\\n\\n“vou and I are old friends, too, Yu-ting, so there’s no need\\nfor us to beat about the bush. I don’t believe in having secrets,\\nmyself. In the matter of women, for instance: if Wu Sun-fu\\nhad a mistress, can you see him parading her in public?—Like\\nto have another look at her, Yu-ting? See what she’s like when\\nshe’s dressed up?—Damn it all, she’s a widow you know! I\\ndon’t usually go in for second-hand stuff, as you know, but this\\none’s an exception: she’s not like all the rest—she’s a real houri!”\\n\\n“Ah, but then you’re a well-known collector and connoisseur,”\\nsaid Li Yu-ting, feeling that he had to say something, “so of\\ncourse you have to have a specimen of every species!”\\n\\nHe was getting rather worried for he feared Chao Po-tao was\\ndeliberately digressing, but his anxiety was unnecessary, for\\nChao Po-tao chuckled his acknowledgement, then returned to the\\nsofa and began of his own accord to explain his attitude towards\\nhis disagreement with Wu Sun-fu.\\n\\n“we can skip all the developments to date, as you’re well\\nenough acquainted with them. Well, to put it in a nutshell, Wu\\nSun-fu needn’t worry about the Exchange settlement—I’m will-\\ning to accept Tu Chu-chai’s original proposals and let it go at\\nthat. But in the matter of the loan to Chu Yin-chiu, I’ve already\\n\\ngiven him my promise, so I can’t go back on it—unless, of course,\\nChu Yin-chiu should want to call it off himself.”\\n\\nAs Chao Po-tao spoke, Li Yu-ting scanned his face carefully\\nand weighed his every word. He was beginning to fear that he\\nwas running his mission on the rocks, for the one thing Chao\\nPo-tao was insisting on was the very thing Wu Sun-fu was not\\nprepared to give way on. Wu Sun-fu was determined to com-\\npensate himself for his losses in his home town not only by\\nswallowing Chu Yin-chiu’s factory but also by acquiring the lat-\\nter’s large stock of cocoons at the cheapest possible price, then\\nrush them through his filatures to fill his orders in time. If he\\nsucceeded in pulling off this scheme quickly, he could make\\nsomething out of it even while the price of silk was dropping.\\nLi Yu-ting knew all this only too well, but Chao Po-tao’s shrewd\\neyes told him that he had seen through the scheme as well, and\\nnow intended to nip Wu Sun-fu where it hurt most. He would\\nrather lose twenty or thirty thousand dollars to Wu Sun-fu over\\nthe government bonds transaction than let him get his hands on\\nChu Yin-chiu’s factory and cocoons. After a moment’s hesita-\\ntion, Li Yu-ting sighed lightly and said:\\n\\n“But it’s just this question of the loan to Chu Yin-chiu that\\nWu Sun-fu’s so concerned about. If you’d like my own opinion\\nas an independent observer—”\\n\\n“Ah, I know why he’s so interested in the loan,” interrupted\\nChao Po-tao, slapping his thigh and laughing triumphantly: “It’s\\nbecause there are some clauses about Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons in\\nthe agreement!”\\n\\nShaken by this unexpected thrust, Li Yu-ting broke out into\\na cold sweat. He was anxious for Wu Sun-fu and miserable at\\nhis own failure. Nevertheless, his anxiety made him abandon\\nhis humming and hawing. He smiled wryly and said in a dif-\\nferent tone of voice, “You’re a sharp one, and no mistake! What\\nstumps me, though, is what use the cocoons are to you. After\\nall, you and Sun-fu are old friends, so why do you have to\\ntease him like this? If he doesn’t get Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons,\\nhe’ll be in a bit of a jam—”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting broke off helplessly here, for Chao Po-tao suddenly\\ngave a derisive laugh; he tilted back his head and blew a cloud\\nof cigar smoke, his flabby face wrinkling with amusement. Li\\n\\nYu-ting’s scalp prickled at Chao Po-tao’s steely voice when he\\nnext spoke, “You don’t understand? Come now, you\\'re joking!\\n—Now, I like to keep everything I do above-board, and if a man’s\\nperfectly frank with me, then I’ll be perfectly frank with him.\\nNow, Yu-ting, since you’re here as Wu Sun-fu’s deputy, I may\\nas well put forward a proposal for him to consider: I recommend\\nShang Chung-li as manager of Wu Sun-fu’s Yi Chung Trust\\nCompany.”\\n\\n“Oh, but—er—will, I’ve heard that they’ve already decided to\\nhave Mr. Tang for manager.”\\n\\n“Yes, so I hear—but I also hear that he belongs to the Wang\\nChing-wei clique.”\\n\\nAt this reply Li Yu-ting’s heart missed a beat; he saw it all\\nnow: the tussle between Chao Po-tao and Wu Sun-fu was not of\\na purely commercial nature. The realization of this fact made\\nhim despair of ever effecting a rapprochement between the two\\nsides. Staring at Chao Po-tao with eyes wide with anxiety, he\\nasked imploringly, “Haven’t you any other ideas, Mr. Chao? What\\nabout—what about having Tu Chu-chai for manager? He’s above\\npolitics, you see.”\\n\\nChao Po-tao smiled. “So’s Shang Chung-li!” came his swift\\nreply.\\n\\nLi Yu-ting smiled uncomfortably, realizing suddenly that he\\nhad gone a little too far for an allegedly neutral observer, and\\ndecided to put on the brake. He glanced at Chao Po-tao, and\\nwas about to declare that his position was that of loyal friend\\nto both sides, when the former stretched and said in a more\\ncasual voice:\\n\\n“So far as Wu Sun-fu’s ability and initiative are concerned,\\nI take my hat off to him; but I must say that he’s too confident\\nof his own capabilities, and that, I’m afraid, is where he’ll come\\nunstuck. That idea of his about forming the Yi Chung Company\\nwas quite a good one, but he didn’t talk it over with me first,\\nwhereas if I’ve got a good plan up my sleeve I always give him\\na chance of coming in on it—like our recent venture on the\\nExchange, for instance. And if I now suggest Shang Chung-li\\nas manager of his company, it’s just because I’d like to co-\\noperate with him. Now, I’m a plain-spoken man, Yu-ting, and\\nI don’t mind telling you if Wu Sun-fu’s going to be so obstinate\\n\\nand refuses to come to his senses, that’s quite all right with me.\\nI only hope he’ll be able to weather all the storms he’s going to\\nrun into. If he can make a go of it, I’ll be the first to congrat-\\nulate him!”\\n\\nChao Po-tao rounded off his ultimatum with a hearty laugh\\nas he swung himself to his feet. He flexed his arms and stretched,\\nthen went across to open the bedroom door. Realizing that he\\nwas going to let out his precious nymph once more, Li Yu-ting\\nhurriedly stood up and made a last appeal:\\n\\n“Mr, Chao—”\\n\\nChao Po-tao turned and looked impatiently at Li Yu-ting, who\\nstarted forward and invited with an ingratiating smile:\\n\\n“Come and have dinner with me tonight. Sun-fu and Chu-\\nchai’ll be there, so if you’d care to come along, you can talk it\\nover with Sun-fu himself.”\\n\\nChao Po-tao let his gaze wander thoughtfully over Li Yu-ting’s\\nface for a moment, then replied with a ghost of a smile:\\n\\n“But if Sun-fu refuses to see sense, I’m afraid your hospitality\\nwould be wasted.”\\n\\n“Not at all: I’m sure there’s every possibility that he’ll soon\\nrealize that it’s better to play a part in a big show than try to run\\na one-man show.”\\n\\nLi Yu-ting spoke with great assurance, though in his heart of\\nhearts he feared the result would be exactly the opposite: the\\nodds were that Wu Sun-fu would refuse to give way to Chao\\nPo-tao.\\n\\nChao Po-tao’s reaction was a guffaw of amusement. He clapped\\nLi Yu-ting heavily on the shoulder, muttered something in Can-\\ntonese, then roared in common Chinese, “What? Did you say\\nhe will soon realize it? Oh no, Yu-ting, don’t think you can fool\\nme—Chao Po-tao! Unless, of course, by ‘soon’ you mean a good\\nsix months. I happen to know a thing or two about Sun-fu’s\\ntactics. I say six months because I know that if he’s set on\\npromoting this company of his itll give him a clear six months’\\ngrace. For the first three months he’ll have a fairly free hand,\\nbut after that he’ll begin to feel the strain—he’ll find that lack\\nof money is cramping his style. And then, if his bankers draw\\nin the rope a little, he’ll really start feeling the pinch! Just\\nnow, he’s sitting pretty, so he expects the other fellow to come\\n\\nround to his point of view. As for him coming round to the\\nother fellow’s—well, another three months and we\\'ll see! Per-\\nhaps sooner!”\\n\\n“Ah, but you’re taking a long-term view of things, Mr. Chao,\\nwhereas I’m looking at the more immediate problems. Say, for\\ninstance, this problem of getting Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons as a\\npledge can’t be resolved the way Wu Sun-fu wants it, then he’s\\ngoing to be in a fix: if he hasn’t got the cocoons, he can\\'t keep\\nhis factory running; and if he has to close down—”\\n\\nChao Po-tao shrugged and smiled grimly, but Li Yu-ting went\\non doggedly:\\n\\n“Then there’ll be more unemployed. Mr. Chao, you know\\nas well as I do that since January labour troubles in Shanghai\\nhave been getting worse and worse, so that they’re a serious\\nmenace to public order and safety. In the interest of all con-\\ncerned, Sun-fu should, of course, make some concessions. But it\\nwould make things a lot easier if you, for your part, would be\\ngood enough to forget about Chu Yin-ch u’s cocoons just this once.”\\n\\nHaving delivered himself of this final appeal, Li Yu-ting felt\\neasier in his mind. He had done his level best as a mediator,\\nand had taken care not to pour oil on the flames. He looked\\nclosely at Chao Po-tao’s triangular face, hoping to find there some\\nsign of assent, but found none. Chao Po-tao shook his head\\ncontemptuously and returned to the sofa. He propped his legs,\\nand said briefly and without a trace of emotion:\\n\\n“You\\'re overdoing it.”\\n\\nThis was worse than a slap in the face for Li Yu-ting, and he\\nflushed hotly. He felt hurt that Chao Po-tao should reject his\\ngood offices so scornfully, and he sat in morose silence for a\\nwhile. Nevertheless he decided to brave the storm once more.\\nHe squared his shoulders and was just going to put everything\\nhe knew and all the skill at his command into one last effort\\nat persuading Chao Po-tao, when suddenly the bedroom door\\nopened an inch or so, and through the crack a pair of little red\\nlips chirped:\\n\\n“Did you want me? I thought you called.”\\n\\nThe lips were replaced by a gleaming black eye. Chao Po-tao\\nsmiled and beckoned. The door swung open and in floated the\\nwoman as daintily as lotus-blossom on the water. She smiled\\n\\nfirst at Chao Po-tao, her head on one side, then turned her head\\nand nodded to Li Yu-ting. Chao Po-tao stretched out his hand\\nto give her snow-white arm a playful pinch, then burst out:\\n\\n“Yu-ying, Mr. Li here says the Communists are coming to\\nShanghai soon! Are you afraid?”\\n\\n“What, those little Reds who’re always chalking up slogans\\neverywhere? Oh, I saw one the other night as I was going\\nalong Chang Pang Road in a rickshaw. When he saw someone\\ncoming, he scuttled away, just like a rat.”\\n\\n“But when you’re off your guard,” Li Yu-ting put in quickly,\\n“a Communist can change himself from a rat into a tiger. Youll\\nfind some of these tigers in Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi, and also in\\nKiangsu and Chekiang!”\\n\\nHe said this hoping that he would be able to steer the con-\\nversation back to Wu Sun-fu, but, to his disappointment, the\\nwoman’s lips parted in a smile and she twittered ostentatiously:\\n\\n“Dear, dear! Tigers, are they? You\\'re kidding!—Well, if they\\nare tigers, there are always tiger-killers like Wu Sung!”\\n\\nChao Po-tao glanced at Li Yu-ting and wound up grimly, “Well,\\nYu-ting, you’d better go back and tell Sun-fu what I think about\\nit. I hope he’ll think it over carefully and let me know what he\\nintends to do. If there are tigers running amok, I’ll take pre-\\ncautions, but that’s no reason why I should give in to Wu Sun-\\nfu completely. Are you free tomorrow evening? Come to the\\nGreat China and we’ll have dinner together and watch the\\ndancing.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he stood up and they shook hands, then he saw\\nLi Yu-ting out into the corridor with a great show of politeness.\\n\\nOut in the street once more, Li Yu-ting straightened up and\\nheaved a sigh of relief, then started back the way he had come.\\nHe began turning over in his mind what Chao Po-tao had said,\\nthen suddenly remembered he still had to go to the police station\\nto bail out the rickshaw boy and his rickshaw. In the Nanking\\nRoad area the police were still taking strict precautions, and the\\npavements were still littered with leaflets. A car sped past, mak-\\ning a wind which sent the leaflets whirling in all directions. One\\nof them blew against Li Yu-ting’s chest; he grabbed at it and ran\\nhis eye over it. The few sentences that he read appalled him:\\n\\n... Under the direction of the imperialists, a con-\\ncerted attack is being launched by the warlords, bureau-\\ncrats, landlords, depraved gentry and compradore-capital-\\nists upon the Chinese revolutionary forces in an attempt\\nto put an end to the revolution once and for all. But the\\nimperialists and the Chinese ruling classes are divided\\namong themselves and the divisions are daily widening.\\nThe present mélée between the Southern and Northern\\nwarlords is an indication that their disagreements are com-\\ning to a head. At such a time as this, revolutionary\\nChinese people must intensify—\\n\\nLi Yu-ting quickly threw the piece of paper away and fied\\nin a panic as if he had the devil at his heels. A veil of darkness\\nseemed to fall before his eyes, and a macabre scene took shape:\\nWu Sun-fu was strangling Chu Yin-chiu while Chao Po-tao was\\nclutching at Wu Sun-fu’s hair from behind. The three of them\\nwere struggling frantically together, heedless of the man who\\nstood beside them, sword in hand, waiting to strike them down.\\n\\n“We\\'re doomed, doomed!” his tortured mind cried. His very\\nbones seemed to turn to water, and his heart was a dead weight\\n\\nwithin him.\\nXx\\n\\nAT length, the Dragon-boat Festival came and went in an at-\\nmosphere of unrest. Merchants found they had to break the old\\nrule and leave the settlement of their first quarter’s accounts\\nuntil the end of the next quarter—the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\nThe war was changing the normal pattern of their life.\\n\\n“Eat your moon-cakes in Peking!”—So said the government’s\\nmilitary authorities, meaning that they expected to bring the war\\nto an end by the Mid-Autumn Festival at the very latest.\\n\\nNevertheless, at the present moment, there were still no signs\\nof the war being brought to an end. Along the Lunghai line the\\nsituation was fluid and both sides were said to be in more or\\nless the same positions as at the outbreak of the war, while\\naround Hankow, up the Yangtse, events were moving more\\nrapidly day by day. It came as a surprise when the combined\\nforces of Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi suddenly captured\\nChangsha! That was on June the 4th, two days after the Dragon-\\nboat Festival. The news threw the Shanghai stock market into\\nan immediate turmoil of excitement. All sorts of rumours were\\nrife, and the speculators attached to the Shanghai Stock and\\nBond Exchange swallowed these rumours eagerly, while at the\\nsame time they themselves manufactured and circulated new\\nrumours.\\n\\nThen came a bombshell: Yochow, a city not far from Hankow,\\nhad been taken by the Red Army commanded by Peng Teh-huai.\\n\\nLi Yu-ting had been to a Japanese friend to confirm the news\\nand had come home in an ague of anxiety. For a while he was so\\nstunned that he could only keep polishing his tumbler-bottom\\nspectacles with a handkerchief over and over again; then he\\ndecided to go and see Wu Sun-fu and offer him some more ad-\\nvice. Ever since his visit to Chao Po-tao on the day of the\\n\\ndemonstration he had been very careful not to involve himself\\nin their controversy, but he was always ready to play the peace-\\nmaker should a suitable opportunity present itself. He had\\nalready made a private attempt to persuade Tu Chu-chai to\\nexert some pressure on his brother-in-law Wu Sun-fu “in the\\npublic interest,” so that there would be at least some possibility\\nof a rapprochement between the latter and Chao Po-tao. He had\\ntold Tu Chu-chai that Wu Sun-fu’s obstinacy and over-confidence\\nwould be his downfall.\\n\\nSo Li Yu-ting hurried off to Wu Sun-fu’s house and arrived to\\nfind he had visitors—in the drawing-room were several people\\nhovering about, seemingly waiting with bated breath to see\\nwhether Wu Sun-fu would smile or frown. They were strangers\\nto Li Yu-ting, though he seemed to remember seeing one of them\\nbefore—a man of about fifty with a little wisp of a beard.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was standing with his back to them, an unusually\\ntense expression on his face. As he caught sight of Li Yu-ting\\ncoming in, he waved a hand in greeting and called out, “I’m\\nsorry, Yu-ting, but I wonder if you’d mind waiting a moment in\\nthe small drawing-room?”\\n\\nHe found someone ahead of him in the small drawing-room—\\nChiu Chun, the lawyer. He was sitting there with a large port-\\nfolio open on his lap, fiddling with the corner of a sheaf of\\ndocuments with one hand and stroking his chin with the other.\\nHe seemed deep in thought, so Li Yu-ting sat down quietly\\nwithout disturbing him and began wondering what was afoot:\\nwhat with the strangers in the other room, he thought, and a\\nlegal adviser in here, Sun-fu must have something important on\\nhis hands.\\n\\nIn the large drawing-room Wu Sun-fu was pacing up and down\\nlike a caged lion, glancing fiercely every now and then at the\\nman with the straggly beard and then at the other three men\\nstanding there in awed silence. He suddenly stopped with a\\nsnort and asked the bearded one in an incredulous voice, “Hsiao-\\nsheng, did you say the provincial government advised us to keep\\nthe Hung Chang Pawnshop open for business?”\\n\\n“Yes, I did,” replied Fei Little Beard, his eyes fixed on the\\nfloor. “And they said that the local bank, the oil-refinery, the\\npower-house and the rice-mill must also carry on, The man from\\n\\nthe county council said that the prosperity of the town depended\\non your shops and factories and that it would be a terrible blow\\nto the town if you decided to close them down altogether.”\\n\\nHe himself secretly hoped that the shops and so on would\\nremain open, but this hope was not motivated by any concern\\nfor the welfare of the town, but rather for the welfare of Fei\\nLittle Beard. Although he was quite sure of being offered another\\njob in the event of Wu Sun-fu’s closing down all his shops\\nin the town—a job in the Shanghai factory, say—he much pre-\\nferred to remain as Wu Sun-fu’s agent in the town, a position\\nwhich afforded him a comfortable living and a certain amount\\nof prestige. Besides, he had boasted confidently to the county\\nofficial that he could easily persuade Wu Sun-fu to change his\\nmind.\\n\\n“Huh!” Wu Sun-fu snorted, and grimaced. “It’s all very well\\nfor them to talk about the prosperity of the town, but what\\nprotection can they give us?”\\n\\nDespite his cynical tone, he was inwardly rather pleased to\\nhear that the people at home looked up to him as the leader\\nof the business circles in the town. Shrewdly guessing what\\nwas going on in his mind, Fei Little Beard pursued:\\n\\n“Just now, everything’s quiet in the town—very quiet indeed.\\nThe new garrison that’s recently taken over is in a different class\\naltogether to Colonel Ho’s lot that we had before.”\\n\\n“Tt wouldn’t be too sure about that!” one of the three men\\nsuddenly interrupted. “You don’t need to go half a mile outside\\nthe town to find vourself in Communist territory. They hold all\\nthe villages round about, and they send their patrols right in as\\nfar as West End Market. Oh yes, it’s quiet enough in the town\\nitself, but the town’s surrounded! The most our one battalion\\ncan manage is to keep the road to the county town open. And\\nI’ve heard that when they’re sent out on patrol they very often\\ndesert and take their guns with them. The Communists have\\ngot twice as many men and weapons as they had before!”\\n\\nThe speaker was Wu Wei-cheng, a man in his thirties and a\\ndistant nephew of Wu Sun-fu’s who had come in from their home\\ntown with Fei Little Beard.\\n\\n“And they say they’ve set up some of these Soviets in the vil-\\nlages!” added a youngster of about twenty who was standing\\n\\nnext to Wu Wei-cheng. He was Ma Ching-shan, a brother-in-law\\nof Tseng Chia-chu—who had already been staying with Wu Sun-\\nfu for two weeks—and he had also just arrived with Fei Little\\nBeard. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him was Tseng Chia-\\nchu, gaping wide-eyed.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu scowled as he glanced at Wu Wei-cheng and nodded\\ncurtly. At this brief nod Fei Little Beard’s heart missed a beat,\\nfor it hurt him more than a good dressing down would have\\ndone. He hastily tried to explain it all away. “Yes, yes, that’s\\nas may be, but the provincial government’s sending troops down\\nto surround the Communists and finish them off, so there won\\'t\\nbe any more trouble in the town.”\\n\\nWu Wei-cheng gave a cynical laugh and was just going to con-\\ntradict Fei Little Beard again, when they heard the blare of a\\nmotorcar horn outside the main gate. Wu Sun-fu dismissed them\\nwith an impatient wave of the hand and strode out on to the\\nfront steps to meet the visitor. The slanting rays of the setting\\nsun threw the shadows of trees on the stone steps, and as the\\ntrees swayed in the breeze, a pattern of light and shade danced\\nover the five steps. Wu Sun-fu glanced down at the shadows,\\nthen stamped on them in his vexation.\\n\\nThe car drew up in front of the house and Kao Sheng, the\\nbutler, dashed across to open the car door, Tu Chu-chai hurriedly\\nsqueezed out, and when he looked up and saw Wu Sun-fu stand-\\ning on the steps, he made a grimace and shook his head. Wu\\nSun-fu’s face darkened when he saw that his visitor was the\\nbearer of ill tidings, but he managed to force a smile of greeting.\\n\\n“It’s fantastic!’ gasped Tu Chu-chai as he came up the steps,\\nmopping his face with a snowy cambric handkerchief. “Ter-\\nrific rise—trading nearly closed!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu said nothing, but just knit his brows in a puzzled\\nfrown. With no more than a glance at Tu Chu-chai, he turned\\nand went back into the drawing-room. The scowl immediately\\nreturned to his face as he said to Fei Little Beard:\\n\\n“Now look here! I couldn’t care less whether everything’s\\npeaceful in the town or not. I opened my shops in the first\\nplace, and if I choose to close them down, then closed down they\\nwill be! I’m not a charitable institution, and it’s no concern of\\nmine whether trade’s slack in the town or not. I don’t care who\\n\\nasks me, county council or provincial government or whoever\\nthey are, that’s my answer, and it’s final!”\\n\\n“Yes, of course, Mr. Wu. That’s just what I told them, but\\nthey—”\\n\\nBut Wu Sun-fu’s patience was exhausted. His lips twisted in\\na sneer as he cut Fei Little Beard short. ‘Yes, I know all about\\ntheir bluff and nonsense! You still haven’t told me how much\\nyou\\'ve collected on the loans that fell due at the Dragon-boat\\nFestival. You told me last time you could count on sixty per\\ncent, though I expected more than that, of course. Well, how\\nmuch did you collect after all? I suppose you’ve brought the\\nmoney with you?”\\n\\n“Er—no, I haven’t. You see, the people in the town are leaving\\nlast quarter’s accounts over to next quarter-day, the same as\\nhere.”\\n\\n“What!” roared Wu Sun-fu angrily. This setback was the last\\nthing he had expected. Although it was only a matter of seventy\\nor eighty thousand dollars, he was very short of ready cash just\\nat the moment, and even seventy or eighty thousand would have\\ncome in very handy. He set his face in a scowl and paced up\\nand down, then paused to look at Tu Chu-chai, who was sitting\\non a sofa taking snuff. The sight of Tu Chu-chai reminded him\\npainfully of the sudden steep rise in government bonds.\\n\\nHis nostrils full of snuff, his eyes closed and his mouth wide\\nopen, Tu Chu-chai was waiting for a sneeze to come.\\n\\n“If you do close down all your shops, including the local bank,”\\nmurmured Fei Little Beard, coming closer, “it\\'ll mean that we\\nwon\\'t be able to get back the loans even at the Mid-Autumn\\nFestival.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu shrugged his shoulders; after a moment’s pause he\\nlaughed and spat out, “Hah! the Mid-Autumn Festival, eh?\\nWell, perhaps by that time I shan’t need to call in my money\\nfrom that quarter!”\\n\\n“Is it just that you’re afraid the town’s still in danger, then,\\nMr. Wu?” said Fei Little Beard, seeing an opportunity of deliv-\\nering a little speech he had prepared. His eyes shifted uncom-\\nfortably from side to side as he went on.\\n\\n“Well, of course, Wei-cheng was exaggerating a bit just now.\\n—And the provincial government really is sending down a strong\\n\\ndetachment of troops to surround the Communists and finish\\nthem off. As I said before, both the provincial and county\\nauthorities are hoping that you will agree to play your part in\\nmaintaining the prosperity of the town. After all, it is your\\nhome town. And besides, if you close down your businesses\\nyou\\'ll never be able to collect your loans. Under the circum-\\nstances, I think you’d best give in to them just for the time\\nbeing. If you\\'ll just wait till the Mid-Autumn Festival you\\'ll\\nsee that everything will turn out all right in the end. Of course,\\nthe pawnshop is another matter altogether, since it was gutted\\nin the fire.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled non-committally, then turned and sat down\\non a chair. He now had the whole picture: the bandit trouble\\nhad not only lost him fifty or sixty thousand dollars outright,\\nbut it had also pinned down his loans for twice that amount, and\\nhe had no way of touching the money. He began to feel that it\\nwas impossible to make everything under the sun go just the\\nway one wished. On the other hand, he consoled himself, the\\nreason things had gone wrong was that it was all happening\\nmiles away down in the country, where he had very little say\\nin the doings of the troops. Well, just look at the enterprises\\nhe was managing personally: there, everything was running as\\nsmoothly as you like. For instance, the Yi Chung Trust Com-\\npany was proceeding according to plan, and Chen Chun-yi’s silk\\ngoods manufactory and a number of smaller factories were about\\nto fall into his hands.\\n\\nThus encouraged, he rapped out his orders to Fei Little Beard\\nin a brisk, decisive voice:\\n\\n“I think you’re right, Hsiao-sheng: I ought to do my duty by\\nthe old town. Apart from the pawnshop, which is out of com-\\nmission, I shall do my best to keep all my factories and shops\\ngoing until the Mid-Autumn Festival. But you must get on to\\nthe battalion commander and make sure he’s going to keep a\\nclose watch on the Communists in the surrounding villages.”\\n\\nFei Little Beard, his eyes still on the floor, replied with a string\\nof deferential yeses. Suddenly, he said, “The local bank still\\nhas more than ten thousand dollars in cash left. I was wonder-\\ning whether we should leave it where it is—”\\n\\n“lll leave it there for use in an emergency,” said Wu Sun-fu\\nquickly, “—for my own shops only. Mind you don’t let anybody\\nelse touch it!”\\n\\nHe dismissed him with a wave of the hand, then stood up and\\nwent over to attend to Tu Chu-chai. Fei Little Beard said “Very\\ngood” and, realizing that that was all, was just going to take\\nhimself off when he saw the wild-looking Tseng Chia-chu still\\nstanding stiffly between Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan near\\nthe window, and he suddenly remembered there was something\\nelse to discuss. He hurried across to Wu Sun-fu again before\\nthe latter had begun talking with Tu Chu-chai and hastily called\\nhim from behind:\\n\\n“Mr. Wu! There’s just one other thing—”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu turned round and glowered impatiently at him.\\n\\n“It’s about Wei-cheng and Ching-shan,” he said timidly. “They\\'d\\nboth like to come and work for you in Shanghai. They’re put-\\nting up in the hotel with me today, but I’ll be going back home\\ntomorrow, so I wonder if you could tell me what to do with\\nthem?”\\n\\nAs he spoke he contrived to tip the young men a wink to come\\nacross but they did not budge. Just then, Tu Chu-chai startled\\nthem all with a sudden deafening sneeze. When he had re-\\ncovered, he rubbed his nose and muttered as he did so: “Every-\\nbody’s coming to Shanghai to find work, but they don’t realize\\nthat the people who’ve already got jobs in Shanghai are losing\\nthem! The banks, the factories, the big firms—they’re all laying\\noff staff and cutting down wages. There are tens of thousands\\nof unemployed walking the streets with no hope of finding a\\njob. When the post office advertised for only sixty clerks, more\\nthan a thousand applicants sat for the examinations. People\\ndown in the country just don’t realize what conditions are like\\nhere, and so they keep flocking into Shanghai. I’ve got seven or\\neight people down for a job when I can find them one, myself.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu made no comment. He frowned and narrowed his\\neyes to scan the two new arrivals. As they stood there beside\\nTseng Chia-chu, they struck him as rather more promising than\\nthis young man: Wu Wei-cheng’s square features promised in-\\ntelligence and ability, and Ma Ching-shan was no fool, he judged.\\nYes, they both looked quite a bit brighter than Tseng Chia-chu.\\n\\nIt occurred to him that he might be able to make something of\\nthem yet....\\n\\nWu Sun-fu beckoned the two young men over and asked them\\na few questions about their schooling and past experience.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Fei Little Beard was hovering around Tu Chu-chai\\nand regaling him with a few well-chosen honeyed words. When\\nhe saw Tseng Chia-chu still standing there with a vacant expres-\\nsion on his face, he drew him outside and whispered, “Your\\nwife asked me to give you a message: she wants you to go back\\nhome as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“I know. Ma Ching-shan just told me. But I’m not going.\\nI’m getting cousin Sun-fu to find me a job in Shanghai.”\\n\\n“Has he found you one? What sort of work are you going to\\ndo? I\\'d like to know, so that I can tell your wife when I get\\nback.”\\n\\n“Tt’s not settled yet. But with my party card I can easily find\\na job in a government office.”\\n\\nFei Little Beard could not help laughing at this. It struck him\\nthat this self-important young greenhorn must have been rather\\na headache for Wu Sun-fu all this time.\\n\\n*\\n\\nMeanwhile, the silence had been broken in the small drawing-\\nroom. Chiu Chun, the lawyer, put the sheaf of documents back\\ninto the portfolio, stretched his limbs, and lit a cigarette before\\nhe replied to Li Yu-ting’s last remark,\\n\\n“Now look,” he argued, “it’s the way of the world—you always\\nget the big fish swallowing the little fish. Even if what you say\\nis true about certain Chinese bankers joining forces with the\\nAmericans with a view to bringing Chinese industry under their\\ncontrol and making the manufacturers their managers, even so,\\nfactory-owners like Wu Sun-fu are still swallowing up their\\nsmaller competitors. As a matter of fact, the fate of seven or\\neight such victims has just been sealed, and the papers are in\\nmy case here. In a day or two I\\'ll be going along to see them\\nas representative of the Yi Chung Trust Company and they\\'ll be\\nsigning contracts handing over the management of their fac-\\ntories to the trust company—actually, it amounts to making\\nthem into the Wu Sun Company, the Sun Chi Company, or the\\n\\nWang Ho Company!... No, Yu-ting, I don’t believe all this\\ntalk about an American-financed trust in Shanghai. In fact, I\\nrather suspect it’s a rumour put about by Wu Sun-fu and the\\nrest of them to pull the wool over people’s eyes. I think the\\nAmericans are making enough out of selling their products\\nhere; they’re hardly likely to want to run factories in this coun-\\ntry as well, especially when the country’s in such a bad way.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, I’m sure Wu Sun-fu isn’t up to anything like that!”\\nLi Yu-ting assured him confidently. “No. I know all about the\\ntrouble he’s having with Chao Po-tao.”\\n\\nChiu Chun laughed and drew hard at his cigarette, then tilted\\nback his head to look up at the fine workmanship of the grape-\\nvine-patterned plaster mouldings on the ceiling. Li Yu-ting fol-\\nlowed the direction of his eyes, then glanced down again at Chiu\\nChun and said quietly, “Seven or eight factories at one fell\\nswoop, eh? Well, you can’t say Wu Sun-fu’s letting the grass\\ngrow under his feet! What sort of factories are they?”\\n\\n“Oh, all sorts: there’s an electric light bulb factory, a thermos\\nflask factory, a glass factory, a rubber goods factory, a sunshade\\nfactory, a soap factory, a celluloid factory—none of any size,\\nthough.”\\n\\n“All bought on the cheap, I suppose?” asked Li Yu-ting quickly;\\nbut Chiu Chun was not to be drawn. Although Li Yu-ting was\\na close friend of the family, Chiu Chun felt it would be a breach\\nof professional honour to give away a client’s business secrets.\\nHe chuckled and changed the subject.\\n\\n“There\\'ll have to be peace in the country before factories can\\nprosper.” *\\n\\nSo saying, he tucked his portfolio under his arm and walked\\nout of the room, closing the door behind him.\\n\\nThe slam of the door made Li Yu-ting jump. He glanced at\\nhis watch and saw that it was just on five o’clock. He had only\\nbeen waiting here for ten minutes, but it seemed much longer\\nthan that. Now that he was alone, he felt like someone kick-\\ning his heels waiting to be called to an interview. He was be-\\nginning to feel thoroughly bored and restless. He stood up and\\nwent across to look at a silk-embroidered picture on the wall—\\nThe Imperial Concubine Chao-chun Leaving the Frontier. Then\\nhe wandered over to the window and stared out at the trees\\n\\nin the garden. Recognizing Tu Chu-chai’s car parked out in\\nthe drive, he suddenly became more restless than ever: there\\nwere strangers in the other room, then there was Wu Sun-fu’s\\nlegal adviser, who had just left the room, and now there was\\nTu Chu-chai’s car parked outside. Yes, it all pointed to some-\\nthing big in the air, And when Li Yu-ting comes along, it’s\\nnot convenient to see him, so they leave him here to cool his\\nheels alone—apparently Wu Sun-fu did not trust him any longer!\\nAfter all, he thought, he was the same old Li Yu-ting that he\\nalways had been—he had not changed in any way. There was\\njust that little matter of the dinner he had been invited to by\\nChao Po-tao the other night—just the two of them, alone. They\\nhad, it’s true, talked about Wu Sun-fu, but what of it?\\n\\nA cold shiver ran down Li Yu-ting’s spine. He was under\\nsuspicion—wrongly—and it made him feel frightened and hurt.\\nHe felt he had only himself to blame: he had been too enthusias-\\ntic about helping his friends, whose interests he had at heart\\nand whose reconciliation was his one aim. If the truth were\\nknown, Tu Chu-chai had probably let on to Wu Sun-fu that he,\\nLi Yu-ting, had suggested (though with the best will in the\\nworld) that Tu Chu-chai should try to curb Wu Sun-fu’s insistency\\non paddling his own canoe. They probably thought he was a\\npetty creature trying to make bad blood between them! Perhaps\\nthey were keeping things from him like this because they re-\\ngarded him as a sneaking spy in the service of Chao Po-tao!\\n\\nThere was a side-door leading out into the garden; he was\\ntempted to slip out quietly that way and have done with Wu\\nSun-fu, but on second thoughts he decided that he could not\\nvery well leave without saying goodbye. Suddenly, he heard a\\nroar of laughter from the people in the other room. He inter-\\npreted the laughter as meaning “He’s a spy—and he’s shut away\\nin there!” is heart pounded, and his finger-tips felt suddenly\\ncold. On an impulse, he gritted his teeth and muttered: “Since\\nthey suspect me of being a spy, I may as well be one for once!”\\nHe tiptoed to the door and had just bent down to put his ear\\nto the keyhole to listen, when thought better of it. “What\\'s the\\nuse!” he thought. “Even if I play the spy for Chao Po-tao, he\\nwon’t necessarily want me for one!” He straightened up, took\\na deep breath, and sank back into a chair. Just at that moment\\n\\nthe door opened, and in came Wu Sun-fu, a smile on his lips.\\nBehind him came Tu Chu-chai, carrying his snuff-box in one\\nhand and rubbing his nose with the other.\\n\\n“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Yu-ting!”’ smiled Wu Sun-fu.\\n“Just had some people up from home—some slight business I\\nhad to attend to.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai vaguely waved a hand in greeting and was im-\\nmediately convulsed by one of his sneezes.\\n\\n“Oh ...Isee...” Li Yu-ting muttered, forcing a smile. He\\nfelt more like crying, for Wu Sun-fu’s smile cut him to the quick.\\nHe stole another glance at Tu Chu-chai, and saw that he was\\nfiddling with his snuff-box and looking extremely worried.\\n\\nThe three men sat down facing each other and began casually\\nchatting. Seeing that Wu Sun-fu looked his usual self, Li Yu-\\nting felt slightly relieved. He slowly began to feel himself\\nonce more, and decided he would continue his role as the impar-\\ntial mediator with everyone’s interests at heart. Accordingly,\\nwhen Tu Chu-chai mentioned the increased activity of bandits\\nin the countryside, Li Yu-ting turned to Wu Sun-fu and said\\nearnestly:\\n\\n“The news that Yochow has fallen is not a rumour, after all:\\nit’s true!”\\n\\n“So it’s true, is it?” smiled Wu Sun-fu casually. “Well, it’s\\nno more than we expected. Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi\\nmust have Yochow in order to protect Changsha, which is other-\\nwise isolated and difficult to hold.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai nodded his agreement. Li Yu-ting was puzzled\\nfor a second, then burst out:\\n\\n“No, it’s not Chang and Pai that have captured Yochow—it’s\\nPeng Teh-huai’s Red Army! Surely you must have heard the\\nnews, Sun-fu?”\\n\\n“It’s just a rumour!” said Wu Sun-fu calmly. “Trying to lay\\nall the blame on the Communists!”\\n\\nHe looked up at the parrot, which was shelling a peanut, and\\nLi Yu-ting followed his eyes to the bird. Li Yu-ting was rather\\nnonplussed for the moment, but, his faith in reports from Japa-\\nnese sources being as unshakable as it was, he decided that Wu\\nSun-fu had been misled by propaganda from some other source.\\nTurning to Tu Chu-chai, he repeated obstinately:\\n\\n“But it is the Red Army! I’m afraid Sun-fu’s version comes\\nfrom someone with an axe to grind. The fact is, while Chang\\nFa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi were attacking Changsha the Red\\nArmy was already storming Yochow. The two cities fell almost\\nsimultaneously. Frankly, Sun-fu, I think all this fighting in\\nHunan is giving the Communists a rare opportunity. Really,\\nChu-chai, I don’t see why they can’t be satisfied with a final\\nshowdown along the Lunghai line, instead of carrying the war\\ninto Hunan as well, when they know quite well that the whole\\nprovince is just riddled with Communists.”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai nodded again, but made no comment. Wu Sun-fu\\nwas still smiling, but a slight frown was beginning to appear\\non his face. Seeing that he had an audience, Li Yu-ting went\\non excitedly, “Just now the situation’s going from bad to worse.\\nThere’s fighting everywhere on both sides of the Yangtse, and\\nthere’s trouble brewing from the Communists in Kiangsi. The\\nHankow area is very badly garrisoned, and there are Commu-\\nnist guerrilla bands operating within twenty miles of Hankow it-\\nself. In Shasi and Ichang, the local troops and the Reds get\\non famously together—like cats and mice living in the same\\nhole!—”\\n\\n“That’s right enough!” interrupted Wu Sun-fu. “Only the other\\nday one of Sun Chi-jen’s down-river boats was commandeered\\nnear Shasi, and he still hasn’t found out whether the troops\\nwho took it were some of the local riff-raff or whether they were\\nthe Reds!”\\n\\nHe stood up restlessly, but sat down again without doing more\\nthan stretch his legs.\\n\\n“yes, Sun Chi-jen’s certainly had a run of bad luck this month!”\\nput in Tu Chu-chai, stroking his chin, “First they requisition\\nhis buses, and now one of his steam-launches has vanished. They\\ntell me it was new last year—hasn’t been in service six months.\\nIt cost him three hundred thousand taels of silver, too!”\\n\\nAlthough he seemed to be taking part in the conversation, his\\nmind was elsewhere: he was worried by the unaccountable move-\\nment of the stock market—the whole country was in chaos, yet\\ngovernment bonds were going up instead of down! He could\\nmake neither head nor tail of it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Wu Sun-fu had stood up again and was pacing\\nround the table, now and then glancing casually or deliberately\\nat Li Yu-ting, but the latter did not notice his glances at all,\\nfor he was still wondering how he could make Wu Sun-fu realize\\nthat in the present crisis it was his duty to co-operate with Chao\\nPo-tao. But he was not to have an opportunity to bring the\\nsubject up again, for just then the butler came in to tell Wu\\nSun-fu that Chu Yin-chiu was on the telephone. Wu Sun-fu’s\\neyebrows shot up and he and Tu Chu-chai exchanged a glance\\nof surprise. Seeing that he could not very well stay on now, Li\\nYu-ting took his leave and departed miserable and frustrated.\\n\\nA cigar in his mouth, Tu Chu-chai wandered aimlessly up-\\nstairs. He was trying to puzzle out why Chu Yin-chiu should\\nhave rung. He found the ladies playing mahjong under an\\nawning on the small roof-garden. Mrs. Wu, her sister Lin Pei-\\nshan and Wu Sun-fu’s sisters, Fu-fang and Huei-fang, made up\\na foursome, while Ah-hsuan and Tu Hsin-to looked on, and the\\ntiles clicked and rattled drowsily. Seeing her husband approach-\\ning, Fu-fang called out:\\n\\n“Come and take my place for a game, Chu-chai!”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai smiled and shook his head, then slowly took the\\ncigar out of his mouth and wandered over to the table to have\\na look.\\n\\n“Tired?” he asked. “Why not let Hsin-to take over? Anyway,\\nhow much a game are you playing for?”\\n\\n“T don’t think you could be bothered to play for half-pennies,\\nDad!” Tu Hsin-to challenged his father good-humouredly, wink-\\ning at Lin Pei-shan,\\n\\n“Come and join us if you want to, Chu-chai,” invited Mrs, Wu.\\n“I know you don’t look at mahjong the way Sun-fu does—he\\nsays it’s a slow-moving and tedious game and that if he gambles\\nat all he prefers fast dice games!”\\n\\nShe gave a pleasant little laugh, but it struck one as rather\\nvague and absent-minded. But then she was always vague and\\nabsent-minded these days—in fact, while speaking to Tu Chu-\\nchai just now, she had missed making a pair of “blank tiles.”\\nThey had only played six rounds, and she had already lost her\\nstake twice. No one seemed to notice her inattention except Tu\\n\\nHsin-to. He had noticed it quite casually, but had no idea what\\nthe reason for it was.\\n\\nHis mother had now left her seat, and he sat down in her\\nplace, opposite Lin Pei-shan. Mrs. Wu had also stood up and\\nwas making Ah-hsuan take her place.\\n\\n“Now,” she laughed, “let’s see you and Huei-fang, the two\\namateurs, beat the two experts!” The laugh died away and the\\nworried look returned to her face. She glanced absent-mindedly\\nup at the sky and slipped away.\\n\\nTu Chu-chai and his wife, Fu-fang, strolled away to the other\\nend of the roof, away from the mahjong table, and leaned on\\nthe parapet, looking out over the garden. Behind them the game\\nwas now in full swing, and they could hear Ah-hsuan and Lin\\nPei-shan above the voices of the other two. Fu-fang turned to\\nwatch them a moment, then said in a low voice, “There’s some-\\nthing you ought to know: Pei-yao whispered to me just now\\nthat our Hsin-to and her sister Pei-shan seem to be very keen\\non each other. He’s always coming round to take her out!”\\n\\n“Well, what’s wrong with that? Everybody does it these days.”\\n\\n“Oh, dear! You are slow! Don’t you realize they belong to\\ntwo different generations in the family? Pei-shan is a genera-\\ntion senior to Hsin-to!”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai frowned and stretched his hand out over the\\nparapet to flick the ash off his cigar. He took a deep breath, but\\nremained silent. With another backward glance at the mahjong\\ntable, his wife went on:\\n\\n“Pei-yao’s also rather worried about it all, Someone else is\\nasking for Pei-shan’s hand, and she thinks he’d make a good\\nmatch for her.”\\n\\n“Who is it? Fan Po-wen, I suppose?”\\n\\n“No: it’s Colonel Lei.”\\n\\n“Oho, Colonel Lei, is it? But he’s away fighting at the front.\\nThere’s no telling whether he’ll come out of it alive or not.”\\n\\n“But he’s coming back soon, so Pei-yao tells me.”\\n\\nLooking rather embarrassed, Tu Chu-chai glanced over his\\nshoulder at Hsin-to and Pei-shan. After a while, he mumbled,\\n“After all, they are related, so there’s no harm in their going\\naround together. The only snag is that morals are so slack these\\ndays, and young people take to the new ways so easily—-anyway,\\n\\nHsin-to isn’t a child any longer, and you can’t very well keep\\nhim in check. There’s not really very much you can do about\\nit, my dear.”\\n\\n“Fiddlesticks! If anything should happen, both families would\\nlose face!”\\n\\n“Well, what do you think we should do, then?”\\n\\n“Don’t you ever listen to what I say? I wanted all along to\\nmake a match between your brother Hsueh-shih and Pei-shan,\\nbut you wouldn’t hear of it because you said the Lins had no\\nmoney—”\\n\\n“All right, all right, my dear! There’s no need to go bringing\\nup old scores! I\\'ll speak to Hsin-to later on. Though of course\\nit all depends on the girl. If she’s really made up her mind and\\nknows where she stands, I don’t think you need be afraid of\\nanything going wrong.”\\n\\n“But her sister says she’s still only a child and doesn’t know\\nwhat’s—”\\n\\n“Humph!”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai shook his head as if he did not believe it, but\\nsaid nothing more. Just then Mrs. Wu came up to the roof-\\ngarden again, and when she saw Tu Chu-chai and his wife talk-\\ning together, she guessed what it was about and shot them a\\nknowing smile. She went over to the mahjong table to see how\\nthe game was going, then turned and moved daintily towards\\nTu Chu-chai and his wife. She was just going to speak, when\\nsuddenly Kao Sheng, the butler, called up from the garden, “Mr.\\nTu! Mr. Wu wants to speak to you!”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai escaped, and Mrs. Wu, looking hard at her sister-\\nin-law, asked her, “Did you mention it to him, Fu-fang?”\\n\\nFor answer, Mrs. Tu smiled; then the two women stood with\\ntheir heads together and conversed in an undertone for\\na while. Only a few words had passed between them when\\nMrs. Wu burst out laughing. Afterwards they turned and walked\\nback to the table to watch the game.\\n\\n*\\n\\nWhen Tu Chu-chai hurried into the study, he found Wu Sun-\\nfu on the telephone, and the voice at the other end sounded like\\nTang Yun-shan’s, They were talking about “the news leaking\\nout after the Hamburg had loaded and sailed” or some such thing,\\n\\nbut it did not mean anything to him. Finally, Wu Sun-fu said:\\n“Anyway, come round straight away,” and rang off.\\n\\nHis face tense and excited, Wu Sun-fu sat down opposite Tu\\nChu-chai and picked up the list of the day’s opening and closing\\nprices on the Stock Exchange, which his broker Lu Kuang-shih\\nsent him every day. He glanced at it, then tossed it aside and\\nsaid, “Chu-chai, can you raise five hundred thousand dollars\\ntomorrow?”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai looked at Wu Sun-fu in amazement, but before he\\ncould reply the latter went on:\\n\\n“The price went up one dollar yesterday, and today it almost\\nreached the limit: it’s just incredible! I suspected all along that\\nChao Po-tao was behind it, and now Tang Yun-shan’s just told\\nme it’s true. He says Wang Ho-fu has discovered that Chao\\nPo-tao and some of his Cantonese colleagues are bulling again:\\nthey buy in whenever a low price appears, but not a large quan-\\ntity—they just buy enough to peg the price and hold it at what\\nit was before the fourth of this month—”\\n\\n“In that case we\\'re sunk!” broke in Tu Chu-chai agitatedly,\\nthrowing away his cigar stub. “We should have covered yester-\\nday!” Tiny beads of sweat began to appear on his forehead.\\n\\n“Eyen if we had covered yesterday, we should still have made\\na loss. The situation’s quite clear: what with the Hankow area\\nbeing threatened and the fighting along the Lunghai line drag-\\nging on, prices are bound to drop sooner or later. If only we\\ncan stop the rise and keep the price down, we\\'ve got nothing to\\nfear. It’s now a battle of wits between Chao Po-tao and us! If\\nthey’re really set on buying in whenever the quotation goes down\\nand if they keep it up till the end of the month, then they \"ll win.\\nIf, on the other hand, we have sufficient reserves—”\\n\\n“Tf we\\'ve sufficient reserves, and if we sell every time there’s\\na rise, and keep it up till the end of this month, then we\\'ll win—\\nis that what you mean?” As he said this, Tu Chu-chai looked\\nhard at Wu Sun-fu, and there was a note of incredulity in his\\nvoice.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled and nodded.\\n\\n“But that’s gambling, pure and simple! Now, Sun-fu! We\\'re\\nin the stock-jobbing game to make a profit, and it’s too risky\\nto do things like that!”\\n\\nThough he felt he had to turn the idea down bluntly like this,\\nTu Chu-chai preserved his customary calm. Wu Sun-fu was\\nsilent for a while, his eyes fixed upwards as if he was engaged\\nin some calculation or other. Suddenly he smacked the flat of\\nhis hand on the corner of the table and said in an earnest voice:\\n\\n“There’s no risk attached to it, Chu-chai; you can rest assured\\nof that. If you can let me have five hundred thousand dollars,\\nI’ll put the pressure on tomorrow, then prices will come down\\nagain, and there’ll be a panic among the small investors. This,\\ncoupled with the fresh advances that Chang Fa-kuei and Pai\\nChung-hsi are bound to make on the Changsha front within the\\nnext few days, will act as a sort of pincer movement, so to speak,\\nwith the result that there\\'ll be a rush to sell government issues,\\nand however hard he tries, Chao Po-tao won’t be able to stop\\nthe rot! I tell you, Chu-chai, we wouldn’t be running any risk,\\nwe\\'d be winning by means of a surprise attack!”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai closed his eyes and shook his head, but said noth-\\ning. He remembered what Li Yu-ting had said about Wu Sun-\\nfu’s pig-headed independence, and decided he would have to\\npart company with him. He saw clearly that there was no talk-\\ning him round. After a while he opened his eyes and answered\\nunhurriedly:\\n\\n“Whether there’s any risk or not remains to be seen, but I\\nstill can’t manage five hundred thousand. If you’re so set on it,\\nand you’re sure of pulling it off, you can always draw on the\\nfour or five hundred thousand in the Yi Chung Trust Company.\\nI don’t see why you shouldn\\'t take the whole lot for stock-\\njobbing.”\\n\\n“Nothing doing there, I’m afraid. All the money was allocated\\nto various uses at the board meeting the day before yesterday.\\nChiu Chun has just brought me the contracts and I’ve already\\nsigned them. We decided to take over the small factories, and\\nI’m afraid the company couldn’t spare what little money is left—\\nthere’s hardly enough left to put the factories on their feet\\nagain!”\\n\\nAs Wu Sun-fu spoke, his eyes gleamed with elation at the\\nthought that he had succeeded in buying out the factories on\\nextremely favourable terms. It was his first victory since his\\ntrust company had come into being a short while ago—a highly\\n\\ngratifying coup, in his opinion. Tu Chu-chai, on the other hand,\\nwas none too happy about it. When he recalled how they argued\\nat the board meeting, he was exasperated and retorted bitterly:\\n\\n“What did you expect? The company’s only just been\\nlaunched, and it’s crying out for capital already! If you must\\ngo in for stock-jobbing, you\\'ll have to drop the factories. And\\nanyway, to go throwing our capital into factories which have al-\\nready gone broke once, and where you’ve no guarantee of suc-\\ncess—no, honestly, I just don’t see how it adds up—”\\n\\n“Now, Chu-chai—” cried Wu Sun-fu, trying to interrupt Tu\\nChu-chai’s tale of woe; but Tu Chu-chai brushed the interruption\\nfirmly aside:\\n\\n“Just let me finish! I haven’t forgotten what you and the\\nothers said at the time. You all said that the factories had\\nfailed because they were short of capital or because they had been\\nbadly managed. You also said that they owed the company more\\nthan a hundred thousand dollars before we took it over, and that\\nthe old Yi Chung Company was being dragged down by this bad\\ndebt. Then we went and bought over this bad debt from the\\nold Yi Chung Company for a mere forty per cent of its estimated\\nvalue—we got the best of the bargain there—so in actual fact\\nwe bought out eight factories, valued at three hundred thousand\\ndollars, for a mere fifty or sixty thousand. Oh, yes, it looks a\\nbargain to get control of eight factories for an outlay of a mere\\nfifty thousand or so—at present—but then—”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai paused, and Wu Sun-fu burst out laughing. Still\\nlaughing, he broke in, “So you think we\\'d lose by putting in\\nanother five hundred thousand dollars, eh, Chu-chai? Well, if\\nwe don’t, the first fifty thousand will have been thrown away. If\\na horse has lost flesh, you have to feed it well before it’ll be\\nany use to you; in the same way, these factories have got to be\\nsupplied with new capital if they’re going to bring in profits.\\nBesides, if we hadn’t spent that fifty thousand on taking over\\nthese factories, the forty per cent that we paid for the bad debt\\nwould have been thrown away as well!”\\n\\n“So in order to retrieve the bad debt you propose to throw\\nin ten times as much again, eh? Seems to me you’re putting\\ntoo much spice into your bean-curd and making it cost as much\\nas meat.”\\n\\n“Not on your life!” Wu Sun-fu retorted emphatically and some-\\nwhat irritably. He rose abruptly from his seat and paced up and\\ndown, smiling grimly to himself. He had never expected that,\\nfar from winning Tu Chu-chai round and persuading him to\\nfinance his stock-~jobbing, he would make matters worse by an-\\nnoying him with his transactions through the Yi Chung Trust\\nCompany. As a matter of fact, ever since they had disagreed\\nat the company meeting over the purchase of the factories, he\\nhad noticed that Tu Chu-chai seemed to be losing interest in\\nthe future of the company, and he was beginning to fear that Tu\\nChu-chai might decide to drop out or refuse to pay up when the\\nsecond instalment on the shares fell due. If that should happen,\\nit would be a serious blow to the company. It was no use try-\\ning to interest Tu Chu-chai in anything which involved long-term\\nplans: all he was interested in was “get-rich-quick” schemes\\nwhich brought him profits tomorrow on today’s investments—\\nand even then he needed a lot of coaxing. The other day, when\\nthe purchase of the factories was being discussed at the com-\\npany meeting, Tu Chu-chai had hotly contested it until Wang\\nHo-fu had said jokingly that buying these factories was like\\nbuying second-hand goods cheap, an idea which appealed to Tu\\nChu-chai. Wu Sun-fu now realized that if he was to hold Tu\\nChu-chai, he must exploit this weakness of his. Once he had\\nTu Chu-chai’s support he could at least negotiate loans with the\\nbanks more easily. But first he must make sure of this man.\\nHe continued to pace up and down, trying to think up some-\\nthing which would appeal to Tu Chu-chai. Presently, he smiled\\nand turned to his glum companion.\\n\\n“Now, look, Chu-chai,” he said quietly, “there are two things\\nwe\\'ve got to consider: the financing of the eight factories that the\\ncompany’s bought, and the one million bonds we sold out on the\\nthird. It’s a case of ‘in for a penny, in for a pound,’ and the best\\nthing we can do is to put a bold face on it and do what we can.\\nIt’s rather like pushing a wheelbarrow up a steep hill—you can’t\\nturn round, so you have to keep on. And that’s why I must\\nhave five hundred thousand dollars more—to enable me to go on\\nbearing in the stock market, and to finance the company’s eight\\nfactories.”\\n\\n“No, it’s too risky for me,” Tu Chu-chai answered shortly,\\nshaking his head sadly.\\n\\nSo, for all his stirring speeches, Wu Sun-fu had failed to strike\\neven a spark of enthusiasm from Tu Chu-chai. Knitting his\\nbrows, Wu Sun-fu pressed him further:\\n\\n“Tf that’s your attitude, we may as well say goodbye to the\\nmoney we\\'ve put into the company!”\\n\\n“No: we can still cut our losses and salvage something from\\nthe wreck. Sorry, but my mind’s made up!”\\n\\nAn unusual note had crept into Tu Chu-chai’s voice, and his\\nface was set.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s heart sank. Nevertheless, he managed a careless\\nlaugh as he took a step forward and patted Tu Chu-chai on\\nthe shoulder.\\n\\n“Come, now, Chu-chai!” he cried heartily. “Never say die!\\nNobody wants you to speculate recklessly. We can always find\\nanother way out. Now, you know there are certain fly individ-\\nuals in Shanghai who take a tumble-down house, redecorate\\nit and patch it up, and then let it for a nice fat sum of key-\\nmoney. If the worst comes to the worst, we can always fol-\\nlow their example and do the same with the factories—though\\nof course in our case we do need to be more patient.”\\n\\n“Don’t forget you’ve got to find a customer who’s willing to\\ntake your reconditioned house!”\\n\\n“Oh, there’ll be plenty of customers!” laughed Wu Sun-fu.\\n“If we can patch it up and decorate it so that it looks fairly\\ndecent, there’s one man at least who\\'d be willing to pay a good\\nprice: the great Chao Po-tao himself!”\\n\\nHe squared his shoulders and began pacing up and down the\\nstudy with confident strides.\\n\\nHalf-convinced, Tu Chu-chai sat watching Wu Sun-fu as he\\npaced to and fro. He said nothing, but his face betrayed a hint\\nof animation. He remembered Wu Sun-fu saying something about\\nChao Po-tao forming a trust company, and was inclined to be-\\nlieve that Chao Po-tao might actually have something like that\\nup his sleeve; the fact that Chao Po-tao would not give way\\nover Chu Yin-chiu’s loan seemed to confirm the rumour. He\\nsuddenly remembered that Chu Yin-chiu had just rung Wu Sun-\\nfu up—perhaps it was about the loan. He was just going to ask\\n\\nWu Sun-fu about it when the latter paced back, planted himself\\nin front of Tu Chu-chai, and began enthusiastically:\\n\\n“Now about our speculation in government bonds: we may\\nhave lost twenty thousand dollars or so to date, but there’s\\ntwenty days and more to go before settlement day, and we’ve\\nplenty of time to turn our defeat into a victory. If we work it\\nthe way I suggested just now we can’t go far wrong. If there\\nwere any money left in the Yi Chung Trust Company, we could\\ndo it through the company; I’m sure Wang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-\\njen wouldn’t object to it. But as the company’s money’s already\\ntied up, it seems we\\'ll have to do it on our own. Though of\\ncourse, our personal interests are closely bound up with those\\nof the company. The trouble is, what with one thing and an-\\nother, I haven’t much left to play with. Even Fei Little Beard’s\\nlet me down, blast him! Tell you what, Chu-chai, let’s go halves\\non raising this five hundred thousand! We can’t just sit back\\nand watch while Chao Po-tao rigs the market as he pleases!”\\n\\nAgain Tu Chu-chai closed his eyes and shook his head, but\\nsaid nothing. The more enthusiastic Wu Sun-fu became, the\\nless he felt like having a hand in it. He feared that the news\\nthat changes were imminent in the Hankow area was simply\\na piece of bluff on the part of Tang Yun-shan, and, what was\\nmore to the point, he had not the courage to cross swords with\\nChao Po-tao—he realized that Chao Po-tao knew too many tricks\\nand was much more ruthless than he was.\\n\\nWell as he was acquainted with Tu Chu-chai’s character, Wu\\nSun-fu was groping in the dark this time and had failed com-\\npletely to see the working of his brother-in-law’s mind. He had\\ntried everything from persuasion to goading, but Tu Chu-chai\\nwas adamant. The only response he could get was closed eyes\\nand a shake of the head—not even a word of refusal. Wu Sun-\\nfu’s patience was running out. Finally, however, Tu Chu-chai\\nsaid in a voice which implied that he was making a great con-\\ncession:\\n\\n“Look, why not wait a day or two so that we can get a clearer\\npicture of the market before we do anything: we can’t rush\\nthese things.”\\n\\n“There’s no time to be lost!” Wu Sun-fu burst out impatiently,\\nand the pimples on his face turned an angry red. “Specula-\\n\\ntion’s like fighting a battle—you must seize the bull by the horns,\\nand move fast! Especially when you’re up against an unpredict-\\nable devil like Chao Po-tao!”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai’s face was paling, and he felt as though his blood\\nwas rushing to his heart and choking it to a stop. As a mat-\\nter of fact, he was lending only half an ear to what Wu Sun-fu\\nwas saying, for he was busy considering ways and means of pro-\\ntecting his own interests. His ideas were no more than a vague\\noutline at first, but gradually they became stronger and clearer,\\nuntil they converged into one single thought: he had two hundred\\nthousand dollars tied up in the Yi Chung Trust Company. He\\nhad put this money into the company under the impression that\\nhe was supplying some “floating capital” which was to be used\\nfor investment in government bonds and for providing loans\\nagainst securities. He now realized that he was wrong, and that\\nhe had been tricked into parting with his money. He had better\\nwithdraw his capital while he could, before the company went\\nbroke. Whatever the prospects of the eight factories, he was\\ndetermined to go while the going was good. It would probably\\nupset the others, but then you can’t please everybody!—And\\nthen there’s Wu Sun-fu here still nattering on about government\\nbonds and the rest of it. Well, yes, admittedly, so far as today’s\\nclosing prices went they had lost some twenty thousand\\non government bonds, but, since the transaction had been in the\\nname of the Yi Chung Company, the loss would be stood by the\\nfour of them—a mere five thousand dollars each; why,\\nhe might easily have lost that much on eight rounds of mahjong\\nat the stakes he usually played for! ... Tu Chu-chai smiled\\nunconsciously to himself as he decided that it was far better to\\nsay goodbye to his five thousand than to worry himself to death\\nday in day out over the fate of another hundred and ninety-five\\nthousand. Nevertheless, he could not find it in his heart to spring\\nthis decision of his on Wu Sun-fu without warning: he ought\\nto break it gently to him, really. Slowly stroking his chin, he\\ngazed thoughtfully at the excited face of Wu Sun-fu.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s expression was rather frightening just now, and\\nhe seemed torn by some inner conflict. He would probably have\\nlooked worse if he had known what was going on in Tu Chu-\\nchai’s mind. As a matter of fact, far from suspecting the truth,\\n\\nhe was wondering how he could approach his sister—Tu Chu-\\nchai’s wife—and get her to instil a little courage into her hus-\\nband. What more could he do single-handed with a man who\\nsat there with his eyes closed, shaking his head and never say-\\ning a word?\\n\\nSuddenly, the man in question stood up, stretched, and broke\\nthe silence of his own accord. “Sun-fu! If you’re quite set on\\ntrying to outwit Chao Po-tao, just be careful you don’t come a\\ncropper in the process! I’ve known a lot of people trip up at\\nthat game!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s eyebrows shot up and he laughed. He imagined\\nthat Tu Chu-chai was coming round to his point of view. After\\na pause, the latter went on, “Another thing: when Li Yu-ting was\\nreporting back about his conversation with Chao Po-tao the other\\nday, he said something rather significant—”\\n\\n“What was that?” Wu Sun-fu asked hastily, rising from his\\nseat and going across to Tu Chu-chai.\\n\\n“When he said that Tang Yu-shan had political connections!\\nIt’s true that Chao Po-tao has political connections himself, but,\\nSun-fu, what’s the use of dragging ourselves into politics? Chao\\nPo-tao doesn’t want to let you have Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons,\\nand it’s more than likely that he’ll use this as an excuse to make\\ntrouble for you—”\\n\\nTu Chu-chai paused again to fish out a handkerchief and mop\\nhis forehead triumphantly. He thought the moment was now\\nripe to break the news gently that he was finished with the Yi\\nChung Trust Company, but before he could begin Wu Sun-fu\\nsuddenly stamped his foot and laughed grimly.\\n\\n“Don’t worry about that!—Oh, yes, Chu-chai, I forgot to tell\\nyou: Chu Yin-chiu rang me up just now to tell me that he’s going\\nto sell me his cocoons and his factory as well!”\\n\\n“Well I’m damned! But why?”\\n\\n“I suppose Chao Po-tao’s heard that I’ve managed to get hold\\nof some cocoons, and realizes there’s no point in keeping Chu\\nYin-chiu’s from me any longer, so he’s changed his tactics: he\\nknows I’m short of cash and he knows I’ve already got enough\\ncocoons, so he’s deliberately trying to push Chu Yin-chiu’s co-\\ncoons on to me so as to leave me with no cash and more co-\\ncoons than I need. In short, he’s doing everything he can pos-\\n\\nsibly think of to get me in a tight corner. But I don’t think\\nhe bargained for Chu Yin-chiu selling me his factory as well!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s voice was calm as he said this, and he showed no\\nsign of vexation, for, though he was short of cash for the mo-\\nment, his mind was still seething with ambitious plans for ex-\\npanding his business, and this served to soften the blow of all\\nhis other misfortunes. Tu Chu-chai, on the other hand, looked\\nworried, for he was rather concerned on Wu Sun-fu’s account\\nand was more convinced than ever that Wu Sun-fu was playing\\nwith fire pitting his wits against Chao Po-tao. His voice was\\nanxious as he asked, “Have you made up your mind to buy Chu\\nYin-chiu’s factory, then?”\\n\\n“I\\'l see tomorrow when I’ve had a talk with him—”\\n\\nHe broke off as the door opened and the butler, Kao Sheng,\\nshowed in a visitor. It was Tang Yun-shan, and he looked dis-\\ntraught: clearly, something serious had happened. Wu Sun-fu\\nand Tu Chu-chai were rather startled.\\n\\n“Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi are retreating from Chang-\\nsha!”\\n\\nHaving delivered himself of this announcement, Tang Yun-\\nshan dropped on to a sofa and sat open-mouthed, scratching his\\nhead.\\n\\nThere was a deathly silence in the room. Wu Sun-fu narrowed\\nhis eyes and glanced from Tang Yun-shan to the day’s list of\\nopening and closing prices which lay on the table. Could the\\nmilitary situation really be turning against him like this? It\\nwas too fantastic! Tu Chu-chai let out a faint sigh: he was to-\\ntalling up his probable losses—no longer five thousand dollars,\\nbut ten, fifteen, even twenty thousand. He had just resigned\\nhimself to losing five thousand, which he could do without too\\nmuch mental anguish, but now it looked as if he might have to\\nlose anything up to twenty thousand, which was quite another\\nmatter!\\n\\nAfter a moment or two, Wu Sun-fu grated through clenched\\nteeth, “Is this just a rumour, Yun-shan, or is it inside informa-\\ntion? Didn’t you tell me this morning that Chang Fa-kuei’s\\nIronsides were marching east towards the Kiangsi border?”\\n\\n“yes, but it now turns out that they’re actually retreating.\\nThey kept away from the Wuchang-Changsha Railway so as to\\n\\navoid any unnecessary losses. Just after I phoned you this\\nmorning, Huang Fen rang me up and told me about it—he’d\\nonly just heard about it himself. I suppose he’d had a telegram\\nin code from his intelligence agent in Hankow. Ten to one the\\ninformation’s reliable.”\\n\\n“Then if nobody else besides us knows about it, we can still\\nsave the situation,” Wu Sun-fu muttered as if to himself, and\\nthe wrinkles on his forehead relaxed slightly. Tu Chu-chai\\nheaved another sigh and resigned himself to a clear loss of twen-\\nty thousand dollars. He swallowed and mechanically fished out\\nhis snuff-box. Wu Sun-fu was rubbing his hands and staring\\nthoughtfully at the floor. Suddenly, he looked up and turned to\\nTu Chu-chai:\\n\\n“We must do what we can. Do you think there’s still a way\\nout, Chu-chai? Yun-shan’s news is a secret, and it’s real in-\\nside information. In all probability Changsha’s still in the hands\\nof the Kwangsi Army, and the movement of Chang Fa-kuei’s\\nIronsides towards Kiangsi is sure to be taken by the public to\\nbe a drive on Nanchang. We must strike while the iron’s hot\\nand get to work this very evening. You, Chu-chai, can put it\\nround among your banker friends that you’re going to demand\\nadditional collaterals for all loans made on government bonds\\nas the only security. That’ll depress the market tomorrow morn-\\ning, and then we’ll begin covering in separate lots—”\\n\\n“TI guarantee Changsha will still be in our hands the day after\\ntomorrow!” interrupted Tang Yun-shan with great assurance,\\nlaughing boisterously for no particular reason.\\n\\nTu Chu-chai nodded his head in silence. For the sake of his\\ntwenty thousand dollars, he was warming once more to the affairs\\nof the Yi Chung Trust Company—he even forgot his snuff-box.\\nHe glanced at his watch: it was ten to six; he could not afford\\nto lose a minute, so, pausing only to tell Wu Sun-fu to make the\\nnecessary arrangements with the brokers, he hurried off. Left\\nalone, Wu Sun-fu and Tang Yun-shan turned to some other busi-\\nness. Wu Sun-fu was the first to speak:\\n\\n“Since the secret about the shipment has leaked out, I’m afraid\\nwe can’t land it at Chefoo as the navy might intercept it off the\\nShantung coast. I’ve just been thinking about it, and so far as\\nI can see the only way out is to nip down to Hongkong and try\\n\\nto make arrangements on the spot to have the stuff shipped some-\\nwhere else.”\\n\\n“Just what I was thinking. I’d better leave tomorrow. I hope\\nyou can take over from me as general manager of the company\\nwhile I’m away.”\\n\\n“Out of the question. You’d better ask Wang Ho-fu to do it.”\\n\\n“Suppose I’ll have to. But—oh, I don’t know, the last fortnight’s\\nbeen just one setback after another. We\\'ve just fixed everything\\nup nicely with the odds and ends of local troops along the upper\\nYangtse, and then at the last minute they go and change their\\nmind and let us down—they just stand by and watch. Result:\\nthe armies under Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi are forced to\\nretreat when they’re within an ace of beating the Central Army.\\nWell, that wasn’t so serious: what’s worse is that the Shansi\\nArmy hasn’t been putting everything they’ve got into it, while\\nthe Northwestern Army has been really hard pushed for the last\\nmonth, with heavy casualties and ammunition running short.\\nAnd now even this little business of the arms shipment that we\\'d\\ngot so well planned suddenly leaks out!”\\n\\nTang Yun-shan seemed to be in despair as he scratched his\\nhead and looked first at Wu Sun-fu and then out of the window.\\nBehind the pavilion overlooking the pond the evening sky glowed\\na deep red, and the trees around were splashed with gold.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu sat with bent head, his left hand on his hip and\\nhis right describing circles on the desk. His expression gradual-\\nly changed from one of contemptuous hauteur to one of gloomy\\nindecision. Presently, the gloom gave way to a flush of excite-\\nment and he looked up abruptly.\\n\\n“So the outlook is still a bit hazy, eh, Yun-shan? You don’t\\nthink there’ll be any change in Shantung before the end of the\\nmonth, do you?”\\n\\n“As things are now I daren’t say anything for certain,” replied\\nTang Yun-shan miserably. “We\\'ll just have to wait and see.\\n—Oh, it’s enough to make one give up!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu broke into sudden, bitter laugh, then slumped back\\nin his revolving chair and closed his eyes. His face was ashen\\nnow, and beads of sweat broke out on his temples. For the first\\ntime in his life he felt utterly incapable and insignificant. His\\nbusiness would run into heavy seas before long, and he would be\\n\\nfloundering helplessly—there was absolutely nothing he could do\\nabout it!\\n\\nAfter he had seen Tang Yun-shan off, he took a turn in the\\ngarden. The last gleam had faded in the west, and night was\\ncreeping out from among the shadowy trees. Lights blazed from\\nevery window in the front of the house. As if repelled by the\\nglare, Wu Sun-fu made for the edge of the pond, where he sat\\ndown in a cane-chair which happened to be left there, and heav-\\ned a deep sigh.\\n\\nHe tried once more to take stock of his business. This was not\\nthe first time he had faced wave upon wave of crises, and he had\\nalways managed to weather the storm and afterwards hoist his\\nsails again and carry on, so that today he was all set for such\\nlarge-scale enterprise as he had never before attempted. He,\\nSun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu shared the right to control eight\\nfactories, all manufacturing household commodities. They had\\nalso advanced new capital—over four hundred thousand dollars—\\nto develop these factories and increase the production of elec-\\ntric light bulbs, thermos flasks, parasols, soap and galoshes, mak-\\ning these things available even to the most out-of-the-way village\\nin the country, and so dealing a fatal blow to the Japanese fac-\\ntories which had recently been transplanted in Shanghai! Apart\\nfrom all this, he was going to take over and run on his own ac-\\ncount both Chen Chun-yi’s silk goods manufactory and Chu Yin-\\nchiu’s filature. He had achieved all this only after a bitter strug-\\ngle, and the struggle he would have to face to keep and increase\\nhis gains would be no less bitter. Heavy seas were only to be\\nexpected: “While the priest climbs a foot, the devil climbs ten!”\\nWas the way it went, but he and his partners were battle-scarred\\nveterans, so what had he to fear?\\n\\nWhen he reached this point in his mental stock-taking, he\\ncould not help smiling to himself. A cool evening breeze ruffled\\nhis gown and he raised his head and looked about him, feeling\\ninsignificant no longer and far from being helpless and alone.\\nHe had noticed that among the old managers of the eight factories\\nthey had taken over were several who would make useful as-\\nsistants: with training, they would make quite an efficient team\\nof executives. The only trouble was that there was a shortage of\\nclerical staff. He remembered his two relatives, Wu Wei-cheng\\n\\nand Ma Ching-shan, who had been to him fora job that day. He\\ncould probably find a use for them. Even though they would not\\nbe a patch on Tu Wei-yueh, they would probably be miles bet-\\nter than that old dodderer Mo Kan-cheng.\\n\\nSuddenly he realized that someone was approaching, and a\\nbreath of perfume came to his nostrils. He quickly turned his\\nhead and recognized the tall, graceful figure that emerged from\\nthe gloom as that of his wife.\\n\\n“we\\'ve just had a telegram from Colonel Lei,” she said softly,\\nleaning on the back of his chair. There was a very slight shake\\nin her voice as she said this. “The funny thing is, it was sent\\nfrom Tientsin.”\\n\\n“From Tientsin, eh? What does it say?”\\n\\n“It says he’ll soon be finished up there and then he’ll be com-\\ning back to Shanghai,” she replied in a strange voice, as if she\\nwas happy and afraid at the same time; but her husband noticed\\nnothing. At the mention of Tientsin a swarm of doubts had as-\\nsailed his over-wrought mind. What could Colonel Lei be do-\\ning in Tientsin? He was commanding a brigade on active service\\n—surely they couldn’t have fought their way right up to Tientsin?\\nIf they had, then think of the effect the news would have on the\\nstock market tomorrow! His momentary optimism and elation\\nhad deserted him now. He felt hot all over, and his wife’s per-\\nfume made him feel sick. He stood up and snapped at her:\\n\\n“That’s some queer scent you’ve got on, Pei-yao!—Come on,\\nlet’s go back in. Fu-fang still here?”\\n\\nWithout waiting for her answer, he walked off. All the way\\nback to the house his mind was seething with questions and\\nanswers. Should he switch over to bulling? No, he couldn’t do\\nthat if Tu Chu-chai wouldn’t fork out and help him, Should he\\nwrite off his eighty thousand dollars as a dead loss and give up\\nspeculating in government bonds for good? No, he could not\\nvery well do that: eighty thousand dollars was enough to start a\\ndecent rubber goods factory. And besides, if he failed to get\\nthe better of Chao Po-tao in the matter of government bonds,\\nhis rival would be in a position to throw a spanner in the works\\nof the Yi Chung Company... .\\n\\nHe found his sister Fu-fang—Tu Chu-chai’s wife—chatting with\\nWu Wei-cheng in the drawing-room. He went straight up to her\\nand said with a smile, “Can I have a word with you, Fu-fang?”\\n\\nFu-fang seemed taken aback for a moment. She glanced at\\nher son Hsin-to and Lin Pei-shan who were sitting side by side\\nat the piano and leafing through some scores, then nodded and\\nsmiled. As he held open the door of the small drawing-room\\nfor her, he turned to Wu Wei-cheng:\\n\\n“You and Ma Ching-shan had better come down to the factory\\ntomorrow and when I see how you get on the first few days I\\'ll\\nbe able to decide what to do with you.”\\n\\n“Oh, Sun-fu, there’s the young man from the Tsengs as well,”\\nhurriedly added Mrs. Wu, who had just that moment come into\\nthe room. “He’s been waiting here a fortnight, you know.\\nCouldn’t you give him a try-out at the same time?” Wu Sun-fu\\nwinced at the mention of Tseng Chia-chu, but nodded his head\\nall the same. He beckoned his wife aside and whispered in her\\near, “I want to get Fu-fang to talk Chu-chai into plucking up\\ncourage and having another go at government bonds with me.\\nI want you to tell her that Colonel Lei’s been taken prisoner and\\nsent to Tientsin after losing a battle and getting wounded—Now,\\nmake it sound as convincing as you can, and be careful you\\ndon’t let the cat out of the bag!”\\n\\nShe was bewildered and could not make out what he meant.\\nFor some reason she felt a pang of grief as the picture of a\\nwounded, captured Colonel Lei appeared before her. Wu Sun-\\nfu smiled and followed her into the next room, where his sister\\nwas waiting. Just as he was about to close the door, he sud-\\ndenly remembered something and put his head back round the\\ndoor to call out to the butler:\\n\\n“Kao Sheng, ring up Mr. Lu Kuang-shih and ask him to pop\\nround before nine o\\'clock.”\\nXI\\n\\nIt was nine o\\'clock in the morning, and half a gale was howl-\\ning along the Bund. At high tide during the night the level\\nof the Whangpoo had topped the landing-stages, and although\\nthe river was beginning to drop now, the water was still rough\\nand choppy, and several black cones had been hoisted above the\\ntowering meteorological observatory in Edward VII Road.\\n\\nThis was the opening attack of the season by one of the storms\\nwith which Shanghai was favoured each summer.\\n\\nA No. 1 tram running eastward towards the Bund to the end\\nof Nanking Road was battling with the powerful head-wind,\\nand its windows rattled noisily as if trembling with fear. It\\nfinally came to a halt at the stop in front of the Cathay Hotel,\\nand a fashionably-dressed young woman got off. She ran straight\\nacross the road as if driven forward by the wind and flew up\\nthe stone steps in front of the hotel. At this moment a young\\nman in smart European dress, with a walking-stick hanging from\\nthe crook of his arm, dashed out through the hotel entrance.\\nThe skirt of the woman’s dress, which had very long side-slits,\\nflapped in the high wind, and as they passed it became entangled\\nwith the young man’s walking-stick and the thin silk tore with\\na pfft!\\n\\n“Blast you!” the woman swore under her breath as she turned\\nto see who it was. A smile immediately appeared on her lips,\\nfor the man was an acquaintance of hers: it was Han Meng-\\nhsiang, a stockbroker. The young woman herself, a beauty\\na VPeuropéenne, was Liu Yu-ying, the widowed daughter-in-law\\nof Han Meng-hsiang’s colleague, Lu Kuang-shih.\\n\\n“Hullo, you’re out early!” he said, smiling and giving her a\\nwink. “Not much fun for you leaving your warm bed and run-\\n\\nning into a gale like this!”\\n\\nHe stepped back to the side of the semi-circular steps and she\\nfollowed him, glaring at him with pretended indignation. Sud-\\ndenly she smiled and said softly, “Now stop ragging, Meng-hsiang,\\nand tell me the number of Chao Po-tao’s room—I can’t remem-\\nber it for the moment.”\\n\\nA gust of wind raised the front flap of her dress so that it\\nwrapped itself round his leg and blew her long hair over her\\neyes.\\n\\nHan Meng-hsiang grunted and put up a hand to stop his\\nPanama hat being blown away. After a moment he sighed and\\nsaid, “What a wind!—It’s rising like government bonds! I sup-\\npose you’ve bought ten or twenty thousand this time, haven’t\\nyou, Yu-ying?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the money—Now come on, do tell me the number\\nof his room.”\\n\\n“If you really want to see him, it’s room number four—”\\n\\nJust then a more violent gust still caught him full in the face,\\nand he quickly turned his back to the wind without finishing\\nwhat he was saying. Liu Yu-ying muttered a brief “Thank you,”\\npushed her hair back and, hips a-sway, disappeared into the\\nhotel. He turned and watched her retreating figure with a smile,\\nthen went slowly down the steps and across the road to look at\\nthe North-China Daily News placard on the corner. “Reds\\nThreaten Hankow, Reported!” screamed the headlines, but Han\\nMeng-hsiang shrugged unconcernedly at the news. Glancing\\nback at the hotel entrance, he caught sight of Liu Yu-ying com-\\ning out again with a look of mortification on her face. Pausing\\nat the top of the steps, she looked all round and seemed to have\\nspotted Han Meng-hsiang across the road, when suddenly a tram\\npulled up at the stop, blotting them out from each other’s view.\\nWhen it moved off again, she ran across to him and, stamping\\nher foot, she exclaimed:\\n\\n“You’re a fine one, Han Meng-hsiang!”\\n\\n“Well, if you must dash off in such a hurry before I can finish\\nwhat I’m saying .. .” he replied with a sly grin, then turned away\\ndown the street, swinging his stick, though he was careful not\\nto walk too fast. When she had recovered her temper, she strag-\\ngled behind him for a while, then caught up with him and\\nwalked along beside him, though she did not speak. She was\\n\\nsure that he knew where Chao Po-tao had gone, and she was\\nthinking of some way of worming the truth out of this sly young\\nfellow. The wind was blowing with a vengeance, damp and cold,\\nand Liu Yu-ying’s dress was of the flimsiest; she gradually edged\\ncloser to him, until her long, perfumed hair was blowing against\\nhis face and tickling his ear.\\n\\n“But surely he went to the Great China Hotel,” he said, as\\nthey were approaching the Custorns House Building. He turned\\ntowards her as he spoke, and his leg brushed against hers.\\n\\n“J waited there till daybreak but he didn’t turn up——” she be-\\ngan with a shake of her head, but just then a gust of wind took\\nher breath away and she broke off in the middle of what she\\nwas saying. She turned her back to the wind and the flap of\\nher dress flew up to reveal a bare white thigh. She bit her lip\\nand shot the young man a coquettish smile, then exclaimed\\npeevishly:\\n\\n“Oh, what a beast of a wind!”\\n\\n“But I tell you it’s a ‘rising’ wind, so it’s a good omen for bulls\\nlike Chao Po-tao!”\\n\\n“Ts that so? Well, perhaps you can tell me where he spent the\\nnight. I never forget a good turn, you know!”\\n\\n“Oho! Let’s arrange it like this, then, Yu-ying! I\\'ll go and find\\nout all about it, and then we\\'ll meet again somewhere—”\\n\\n“Shut up... .”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m sorry if I’ve said more than I needed. I was forget-\\nting you’re an old hand at the game. You naturally prefer to\\ngive me your tacit consent. Am I right?”\\n\\n“Oh, all right, then: now tell me!”\\n\\nShe rolled her eyes at him and smiled seductively. He hesi-\\ntated a moment and looked up at the patches of white cloud\\nscudding across the sky, then squared his shoulders as if he had\\nmade up his mind and bent over to whisper something in Liv\\nYu-ying’s ear. She immediately frowned and her eyes blazed\\nangrily. As she parted her lips in a mirthless smile, her even\\nwhite teeth were bared as if ready to bite. He shuddered in\\nspite of himself, for he had never imagined that a woman with\\nsuch a soft, creamy skin could look so ghastly when she was\\nangry! Almost immediately, however, her expression returned\\nto normal, and she pursed her lips into a smile. Just then an-\\n\\nother fierce gust of wind threatened to sweep her off her feet,\\nand she grasped his arm for support.\\n\\n“Thanks!” she exclaimed. “But I think I’ll go and see him\\nall the same.”\\n\\n“Now don’t go upsetting yourself over it,” he urged her candidly\\nas he armed her along. “You’d best wait until he wants you and\\nasks for you, rather than go rushing in. I can tell, he can be\\nreally nasty sometimes. When he doesn’t want you, he cuts you\\ndead. The only exception is Hsu Man-li, and he can’t afford to\\nignore her!”\\n\\nThe wind was flercer than ever now, and its howling completely\\ndrowned the roar of the city. Grey and white clouds raced\\nhelter-skelter across the sky, and the wind blew damper and\\nchillier still. Yet Liu Yu-ying felt it was still not bracing enough,\\nand her thoughts raced faster than the clouds overhead. As\\nthey reached Hankow Road she stopped dead and pulled her arm\\nout of his, then stepped back with a disarming smile, blew him\\na kiss, and jumped into a rickshaw. Han Meng-hsiang stood\\nrooted to the ground, gaping after her receding figure.\\n\\nThe words “Ring you later!” and a tinkling laugh came back\\nto him on the wind.\\n\\n*\\n\\nHalf an hour later, Liu Yu-ying found herself embarking on\\na little adventure in a five-storeyed building in Avenue Joffre.\\nShe wrote the name “Hsu Man-li” on a slip of paper and gave it\\nto a page. As she followed him up to the room, she went over\\nonce more in her mind the three sets of tactics she had worked\\nout for her coming encounter with Chao Po-tao.\\n\\nThe door opened, and she slipped in, smiling, but was taken\\naback when she found that Chao Po-tao’s companion was not a\\nwoman at all: it was his crony Shang Chung-li! She immediately\\ndecided that none of her carefully-planned tactics would be of\\nany use now. His face dark with anger, Chao Po-tao leapt to\\nhis feet and barked:\\n\\n“So it’s you! Who sent you here?”\\n\\n“Hsu Man-li,” she said, on the spur of the moment. She was\\nbeginning to fear that she was going to fail in her adventure this\\ntime. But, not forgetting she still had her “woman’s armoury,”\\nshe put on her brightest smile, greeted Shang Chung-li and sat\\n\\ndown with her back to the window. She was sitting in a strong\\ndraught, but she was too busy to notice it—closely watching Chao\\nPo-tao’s face, calming her own mind, and working out a new\\nplan of attack.\\n\\n“Nonsense!” snorted Chao Po-tao, shrugging his shoulders and\\nsmiling sardonically. “Hsu Man-li doesn’t know I’m here—\\nunless she’s got second sight! You must have wheedled it out\\nof young Han Meng-hsiang!”\\n\\nSo her bluff was called, just like that, Her heart was pound-\\ning, but suddenly she guessed that he had not seen Hsu Man-li\\nduring the last few days. It was worth the risk to tell another\\nlie to cover up the first one—and she was a skilful liar, too. In\\nno time at all she had concocted her story—based on what Han\\nMeng-hsiang had told her about Chao Po-tao’s relations with\\nHsu Man-li and on other scraps of hearsay she had picked up\\nabout her. Her smile vanished, and she assumed a look of in-\\njured innocence.\\n\\n“Now that’s hardly fair: you’ve got it all wrong! Asa matter\\nof fact, I came here of my own accord but it was from Hsu Man-\\nli that I found out where you were. I waited for you last night\\nin the Great China Hotel, but you didn’t come and I was feeling\\nfed up, so I went into the ballroom to have a look round, and\\nthere she was; but she didn’t recognize me. She was muttering\\naway to some man, and I happened to overhear what she was\\nsaying—nobody else would have guessed who it was she was\\ntalking about, but I knew straight away it was you she meant.\\nShe—she—”\\n\\nShe stopped, not knowing quite how to go on. As luck would\\nhave it, a gust of wind blew her hair over her eyes; seizing\\nher opportunity, she stood up and closed the window, and so was\\nable to disguise her hesitation.\\n\\n“Did she tell him I was staying here?” Chao Po-tao asked im-\\npatiently.\\n\\n“Yes, she told him that you were staying here and that you\\nhad some new dodge up your sleeve—”\\n\\n“Eh! Do you know who the man was?” Chao Po-tao inter-\\nrupted, wide-eyed. “What does he look like?”\\n\\nSomething in his look told her that he was not only anxious\\nto know who the man was, but also that he had made a con-\\n\\nfident guess about his identity already. She had hardly expected\\nthis, and her heart began pounding again. She frowned and put\\nher head on one side, then suddenly smiled and said, “Oh, I\\nthink he must be a friend of yours! He’s not all that tall, and\\nnot particularly good-looking ...I think I’ve met him some-\\nwhere before.”\\n\\nChao Po-tao winced and looked significantly at Shang Chung-\\nli, who pulled at his beard and smiled.\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying felt suddenly hot. She stood up and opened the\\nwindow again, then remained standing there, looking out. A\\ngust of wind struck her in the face, carrying with it a tiny leaf.\\nThe trees lining the street were swaying drunkenly, and the wind\\nseemed to be blowing as hard as ever.\\n\\n“It must be Wu Sun-fu!l’ Chao Po-tao muttered to Shang\\nChung-li, bringing the flat of his hand down with an agitated\\nthwack on the arm of the sofa. ‘Damn it, she’s gone and hooked\\nhim too!”\\n\\n“Wu Sun-fu?” Yes, she knew who that was. So she really\\nhad met him, after all. She remembered her father-in-law, Lu\\nKuang-shih, mentioning Wu Sun-fu just recently in connection\\nwith some political party or other. She also remembered Han\\nMeng-hsiang dropping a remark about Wu Sun-fu and Chao Po-\\ntao falling out over something. She was so overjoyed that she\\nnearly burst out laughing. Her makeshift lie had done the trick,\\nand she now felt perfectly at ease. She decided she would em-\\nbroider her masterpiece of deception still further. She was ready\\nto lie the devil out of countenance today!\\n\\n“I expected something like this all along,” replied Shang\\nChung-li in an undertone, slowly stroking his beard and shooting\\nLiu Yu-ying an appraising glance. ‘“‘That’s why I advised you\\nto keep a firm grip on Hsu Man-li.”\\n\\nChao Po-tao turned to Liu Yu-ying again and asked icily,\\n“What else were they talking about?”\\n\\n“Well, I didn’t understand a lot of it, so I can’t really re-\\nmember, but it seemed to be something about the stock market\\nand that sort of thing. And then I heard the word ‘gun’—I sup-\\npose they meant that somebody ought to be shot—and then the\\nman pulled a face and made a gesture as if—”\\n\\nShe had got as far as this with her fairy-tale, and was feeling\\nquite pleased with herself, when Chao Po-tao suddenly threw\\nback his head and roared with laughter, while Shang Chung-li\\nnarrowed his eyes at her and shook his head. Didn’t they\\nbelieve her, then? Her heart began pounding again. Chao Po-\\ntao’s laughter subsided, and his face became quite stern. Sud-\\ndenly he sprang to his feet, clapped her sharply on the shoulder,\\nand cried:\\n\\n“yu-ying, your heart’s in the right place! You\\'ve told us quite\\nenough! Now, there’s somebody in the other room, an acquain-\\ntance of yours. You can go and keep her company for a while!”\\n\\nAs he spoke, he waved towards the door on the left, then\\ngrasped her by the arm, shoved her into the room, and closed the\\ndoor behind her.\\n\\nShe found herself in a luxuriously-furnished bedroom with\\nFrench windows opening on to a baleony. A double bed occupied\\nthe centre of the room, with one end against the wall and the\\nother towards the windows. On the bed lay a woman in a white\\nsilk night-dress, her face to the other side of the room. Liu Yu-\\nying just stood there in a trance, wondering what it had all\\nmeant: why had Chao Po-tao suddenly burst out laughing like\\nthat, and then shoved her into this room? She could not make\\nup her mind for the moment whether it was a good sign or a\\nbad one. She strained her ears to hear what was going on in\\nthe next room: not a sound! She peeped through the keyhole\\nand saw that Chao Po-tao was smoking a cigar, while Shang\\nChung-li was stroking his beard.\\n\\nOne of the French windows was open, and the wind was blow-\\ning in in intermittent gusts. Now and then the woman’s silk\\nnight-dress puffed up like a soft, translucent shell, and her newly-\\nwaved hair fluttered on the pillow. Yet the woman slept on.\\nFeeling calmer now, Liu Yu-ying tiptoed across to the bed; when\\nshe saw who it was she all but shrieked with surprise. Who\\nshould it be but her bosom friend Feng Mei-ching! So it was\\nthis little girl of sixteen or seventeen who had been the cause\\nof her waiting all night in vain for Chao Po-tao at the Great\\nChina Hotel! Although Liu Yu-ying had often told herself that,\\nso long as she could tap him for money from time to time, she\\ncould not care less how many girls Chao Po-tao picked up to\\n\\nsleep witn, nevertheless, just at this moment, she was consumed\\nwith jealousy, and had half a mind to wake Feng Mei-ching up\\nand ask her what the devil she thought she was doing. It was\\nat that moment that the girl woke up of her own accord. She\\nrubbed her eyes, turned on to her back, and languidly raised her\\nlegs, so that her night-dress slipped down to her waist, leaving\\nher thighs unashamedly bare.\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying smiled to herself and slipped out on to the balcony.\\nShe was thinking of playing a joke on Feng Mei-ching, just to\\nget her own back, but she suddenly caught a snatch of conversa-\\ntion, and the voice was Chao Po-tao’s:\\n\\n“You’re quite right: the ‘guns’ they were talking about must\\nmean the shipment of arms. Oh, hell! It was just my bad luck\\nthat Hsu Man-li should still have been hanging about at my place\\nthe day that German came to see me; I forgot for the moment\\nthat she knew a few words of English....”\\n\\n“Cherchez la femme,” came Shang Chung-li’s voice. “Your\\ntrouble is, you’re too fond of ’em—you’ve got two here this very\\nminute!”\\n\\nWhen Liu Yu-ying heard this, she swore under her breath:\\n“Oh, go to hell, you old—!” Then she heard a roar of laughter\\nfrom Chao Po-tao.\\n\\n“It doesn’t look as if we can trust that German. He’s prob-\\nably buttering his bread on both sides. He gets fifty thousand\\ndollars from us and then goes and blabs to Wu Sun-fu!”\\n\\n“Blast him! The bribe is a small matter— we could get it\\nback if it came to that. The point is, our reputation’s at stake!\\nIf we let our people down this time, they’ll never trust us again.\\nWe must stop the shipment falling into their hands at all costs!”\\n\\n“Well, what about taking the matter up with the broker?. . .”\\n\\nSuddenly a plane-tree in front of the balcony rustled in the\\nwind, so that it was impossible to hear any more of the con-\\nversation. The wind, which slackened off some time since, now\\nsuddenly rose again. Liu Yu-ying was standing with her face\\nto the east, and was forced to close her eyes, so strong was the\\nwind. A sudden bang startled her as the window blew to and\\nimmediately swung open again. She looked round to find that\\nFeng Mei-ching had raised her head and was staring in wide-\\neyed amazement. The two women’s eyes met for a second, then\\n\\nlooked away again. Feng Mel-ching blushed but Liu Yu-ying\\nbit her lip and smiled.\\n\\n“What are you doing here, Yu-ying?” asked the embarrassed\\nFeng Mei-ching, clambering off the bed and shaking down her\\nnight-dress. She joined Liu Yu-ying on the balcony, where the\\nwind first made her full-bottomed night-dress belly out, then\\nwhisked it up to reveal her plump white buttocks. Liu Yu-ying\\ntittered and exclaimed:\\n\\n“Mei-ching! Somebody down in the street is looking up at you\\n\\n“Where’s Fatty? Oh, bother the wind! Looks like rain. Have\\nyou been to my place, Yu-ying? And what are you doing here?”\\n\\nWhile she rambled on like this, she held down her night-dress\\nwith her hand, and her eyes never left Liu Yu-ying’s face. The\\nlook in her eyes was a mixture of apprehension, disgust, shame\\nand jealousy. But Liu Yu-ying paid no attention whatsoever to\\nall this, for she was too busy eavesdropping on the conversation\\ngoing on in the next room. A moment ago she had happened to\\ncatch a phrase or two which had aroused her curiosity, and which\\nmade her realize suddenly why Chao Po-tao could not afford to\\nslight Hsu Man-li.\\n\\n“Oh, bother the wind!” she muttered as if to herself, instead of\\nanswering Feng Mei-ching’s string of questions. She frowned\\nand strained her ears, but she could only catch a few blurred,\\ndisjointed words of which she could make neither head nor tail.\\nNothing could be heard clearly above the noise of the wind, and\\nshe imagined that the wind was blowing all sound of the con-\\nversation next door away in the opposite direction. She heaved\\na sigh of disappointment.\\n\\n“Who are you so angry with, Yu-ying? I haven’t done any-\\nthing to you—”\\n\\nFeng Mei-ching seemed unable to contain herself any longer.\\nHer face was pale and she was looking daggers at Liu Yu-ying.\\nLiu Yu-ying had not expected this; it made her blood boil, and\\nshe flushed to the tips of her ears. She was on the verge of\\nflaring up, but thought better of it and beat her anger back, then\\ntook Feng Mei-ching’s hand gently in hers and said with a smile:\\n\\n“well, well! It’s only a few days since I saw you last, but\\nyou\\'ve changed completely! You’re more sure of yourself—no\\none could help noticing the difference. I came today to offer\\n\\n?\\n\\nyou my congratulations, so how could I possibly be angry with\\nyou?”\\n\\nAt this Feng Mei-ching crimsoned and jerked her hand out of\\nLiu Yu-ying’s grip. Without a word, she ran back into the room\\nand flung herself on the bed. Liu Yu-ying smiled with satisfac-\\ntion, and was just going to go back into the room again, when\\nsuddenly Chao Po-tao’s voice could be heard once more; this\\ntime it was loud and excited, ringing with optimism and con-\\nAdence.\\n\\n“Just you wait and see! Wu Sun-fu is overreaching himself\\nthis time, and he’ll soon find himself in hot water! Any Chinese\\nwho runs industrial enterprises without foreign capital behind\\nhim is doomed to failure. And then look at the way he speculates\\nin government bonds: huh! This month he started off as a\\nbear; then, when he saw that the situation in Changsha was\\nquite peaceful, he changed over to bulling, and at the moment\\nhe’s probably holding six or seven million. If my guess is cor-\\nrect, he’s got a tidy lot of futures booked for delivery next month.\\nWhat he’s banking on is that the Shansi Army won\\'t start any\\nlarge-scale operations, and that there won’t be any major battles\\non the Tientsin-Pukow line, until about the tenth of next month,\\nha ha! Wu Sun-fu’s very shrewd in his calculations, but, un-\\nfortunately for him, Chao Po-tao is going to have a bit of fun\\nat his expense! I’ll wait until he’s got halfway up the hill, and\\nthen I\\'ll pull him down by his leg!”\\n\\nAfter a moment’s silence there was a rapid exchange of ques-\\ntions and answers, and the two men’s voices were so jumbled\\ntogether that Liu Yu-ying could make nothing of it. She stood\\nlost in thought, wondering just how Chao Po-tao proposed to\\n“pull Wu Sun-fu down by his leg”; anyway, she wasn’t really\\ninterested when they just talked shop: she was just listening in\\ncase there should be any more interesting bits about Hsu Man-\\nli. Meanwhile, Feng Mei-ching was giving Liu Yu-ying ven-\\nomous looks and working off her feelings by biting the corner of\\nher handkerchief. Liu Yu-ying smiled and deliberately turned\\nher back on her as if she were put out. Just then she heard\\nShang Chung-li’s voice again:\\n\\n“So you’ve decided to fight it out with them, eh?... How\\nmuch are you going to get rid of?”\\n\\n“tt all depends. As the prices go up, I’ll unload, and lll con-\\ntinue unloading until Wu Sun-fu collapses and the Yi Chung\\nTrust Company folds up! And what’s more, Chung-li, I had the\\ntip-off some time ago that a strategic withdrawal has been\\nplanned from the northern section of the Tientsin-Pukow lne—\\nit\\'ll only be a matter of time. Today’s the seventeenth, and\\nthere’s still ten days to go before the settlement. If our plan\\nhasn’t been successful by then, and Wu Sun-fu looks like getting\\nthe better of us, we can always resort to the old method which\\nproved so effective last month, can’t we? . . 2\\n\\nThen came roars of laughter which seemed to come nearer\\nand nearer, until Chao Po-tao’s head suddenly popped out of the\\nwindow of the next room. Fortunately for Liu Yu-ying, he\\nlooked straight down at the street. She started with surprise\\nand slipped back hastily into the room. She bounded across the\\nroom and sat down on the bed beside Feng Mei-ching with her\\nhand pressed against her chest.\\n\\nFeng Mei-ching angrily straightened her legs and rolled over\\nso that she put a foot or so between Liu Yu-ying and herself,\\nas if her friend were covered with prickles.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t be so childish, Mei-ching!” smiled Liu Yu-ying,\\nwho had now recovered her composure. “What\\'s it all about,\\neh? Like good sisters, we should bare our hearts to each other.”\\n\\nShe sat staring at Feng Mei-ching’s back as she spoke, but\\nher attention was otherwise engaged: she was turning over and\\nover in her mind the scraps of conversation which she had just\\noverheard. Of course, she was perfectly well aware what Feng\\nMei-ching was cross about, but she had not the time to bother\\nherself with her petty jealousies. Encouraged by the unexpected\\nprogress she had made in the course of her “adventure,” she\\nwas now busy planning how best she might become a second Hsu\\nMan-li and then get Chao Po-tao under her thumb even more\\nskilfully than Hsu Man-li herself had done. As she racked her\\nbrains, she reached out and rolled Feng Mei-ching over again.\\n\\n“Now listen, Mei-ching, you must believe what I say,” she\\nurged. “I didn’t come here to pick a quarrel with you, and I\\ndidn’t come to talk to Chao Po-tao. I happened to be passing\\nby and I just popped in to see you. You must know by now what\\nI’m really like: ever since my husband died, I’ve had no heart\\n\\nfor anything, and I just go on from day to day enjoying myself\\nwhen I can. I don’t want to fight anybody. We’re good friends,\\nand all I want to do is to help you. You don’t imagine I came to\\nspoil your little game?”\\n\\n“All right, then, tell me the truth: did Fatty ask you to come\\nhere?”\\n\\n“No; I came here for something else,” Liu Yu-ying answered\\noffhandedly, and smiled. She was trying to make up her mind\\nwhether to leave without more ado, or whether to wait until\\nshe had a chance to tell Chao Po-tao some more lies.\\n\\n“Fatty in the next room?” asked Feng Mei-ching. She smiled\\nand gazed into Liu Yu-ying’s face, waiting for an answer, her\\neyes betraying a childish naivety, that was quite ludicrous.\\n\\n“He’s out there with a visitor—surely you knew?” Liu Yu-\\nying replied quietly, resting her chin on Feng Mei-ching’s shoulder.\\nShe was still trying to make up her mind what to do. Feng Mei-\\nching shook her head without a word and smiled languidly. Now\\nthat she had got over her jealousy, her head was beginning to\\nfeel heavy and her limbs weak. She had rather overdone it dur-\\ning the night.\\n\\nFor a while there was silence in the room, broken only by the\\nwhistling and moaning of the wind outside the windows.\\n\\n“Well, I must be off now, Mei-ching. Fatty’s still busy with\\nhis visitor. Come to the pictures with me tomorrow.”\\n\\nAs she said this, Liu Yu-ying opened the door and slipped into\\nthe other room. Her plans were laid. To her surprise, she found\\nShang Chung-li sitting there alone with a cigar in his mouth,\\nlost in thought. Their eyes met, but the old man just stroked\\nhis beard and smiled vaguely as if only half aware of her. Liu\\nYu-ying decided she would have to abandon her plan. Glancing\\nat Shang Chung-li and pointing towards the door of the bedroom,\\nshe tittered and went out.\\n\\nWhen she reached the street, she went into a shop to ring\\nfor a taxi. She was going to see Han Meng-hsiang and make\\nsure she had him under her thumb before she did anything\\nelse. In a few moments she was sitting in the car, which battled\\nforward against the howling gale, and as she sat there the thoughts\\nraced through her head faster than the wind outside. She bit\\nher lip and smiled as she thought: “Chao Po-tao, my lad, if\\n\\nyou don’t agree to my terms, all right: then we part company\\nfor good. Wu Sun-fu would be only too glad to pay me a good\\nprice for that little secret of yours! Well, whoever pays me a\\nfair price can have it!”\\n\\n*\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying was a clever girl. She had been to school for\\nseveral years until she was seventeen, and she knew more\\nChinese than her friend Feng Mei-ching. She had had a thorough\\ngrounding in all the intricacies of stock exchange business and\\nwas quite at home in it. About ten years before, her father had\\ngone bankrupt and committed suicide after a great upheaval\\non the Exchange. Her brother had made a living on the merry-\\ngo-round of get-rich-quick gambles and moonlight flits until last\\nyear, when he had lost heavily on his speculations in gold bars\\nand had then received a prison sentence for embezzlement; he\\nwas still in prison at that time. Her father-in-law, Lu Kuang-\\nshih, and her late husband had talked of nothing else but gold\\nbars and government bonds every time they opened their mouths.\\nShe herself had lately come to use the floor of the Exchange\\nas her “home” during the day, and there, guided by some sixth\\nsense, she would buy or sell anything up to ten thousand at a\\ntime, though she always took great care not to involve herself\\ntoo deeply. She had learned a lesson from the failures of her\\nfather, her brother, her father-in-law and her husband, and pre-\\nferred to play safe and be satisfied with making of fifty or sixty\\ndollars on ten thousand government bonds.\\n\\nBeing a woman, she realized that men and women had different\\nways of making money: men used money as capital, whereas\\nwomen used themselves as capital. This was why, although she\\nplayed safe where government ponds were concerned, she was\\nprepared to gamble recklessly in her relations with Chao Po-tao.\\nWhen, a month or so ago, she had first got to know him through\\nHan Meng-hsiang, she had decided at once that he was just\\nanother kind of “speculation.” And out of this speculation she\\nwas expecting to make quite a packet!\\n\\nAnd now her “harvest” was ready for reaping. Every nerve\\nin her body was tensed, and her brain piled up one plan after\\nanother, one cunning move after another. When she reached\\n\\nthe Exchange, she thought to herself: “It might be a good idea\\nto sell my secret retail. For the last month everybody here has\\nbeen snooping around trying to find out the secret of Chao Po-\\ntao’s success!” She had employed her wits to analyse and sift\\neverything she had overheard and had come to the conclusion\\nthat the “shipment of munitions” and “the German” would be of\\ninterest only to Wu Sun-fu. So far as speculation in government\\nbonds was concerned, she concluded that Chao Po-tao was not\\nonly intending to turn bear, but also had up his sleeve what\\nhe called “the old method,” which guaranteed him success every\\ntime. She was not very clear what this “old method” was, but\\nshe firmly believed that Chao Po-tao had a whole bag of tricks\\nat his disposal and could do what he said.\\n\\nThe floor of the Stock Exchange was even more crowded and\\nnoisy than a busy market-place. The air was suffocating and\\nreeked of sweat. Unable to squeeze through the crowd to the\\nfront, Liu Yu-ying craned her neck above the sea of heads until\\nshe caught sight of Han Meng-hsiang’s glossy black head of hair,\\nbut he was too far away for her to be able to attract his attention.\\nUp on the platform the announcer and the telephonists were all\\nred in the face as they gesticulated and shouted, but it was im-\\npossible to hear a word they were saying. Seventy or eighty\\nbrokers, together with their hundred-odd assistants and innu-\\nmerable speculators, produced between them such a deafening\\npandemonium of shouting and bidding that no ordinary ear could\\nhave made anything of it.\\n\\nWhen “Reorganization and Disbandment for This Month” was\\nposted on the board above the platform, an even louder and\\nlonger roar of figures thundered through the Exchange, and the\\nsea of excited faces surged right and left as they fought to get\\nto the front. Unable to keep even the place she had got, Liu\\nYu-ying was forced back to the door. After a pause for breath,\\nshe returned to the attack and eventually managed to fight her\\nway through the crowd and get a seat on the benches between\\nthe entrance and the exit, against the wall where the Exchange\\nnotices and lists of brokers’ names and numbers were posted\\nup. This was a sort of “rear hospital” where those who had been\\nput hors de combat at the front came to sit and pant. Here it\\nwas impossible to see even the head of the announcer on the\\n\\nplatform, though one could just see his hand held up in the\\ndistance.\\n\\nWhen Liu Yu-ying looked down and saw that her dress of\\npale blue gauze was soaked with sweat and that her nipples\\nshowed through as two round, rosy blurs, she could not help\\nsmiling. How comical it all was, she thought: here in the\\nExchange was the “madding crowd,” while somewhere outside\\naway from it all Chao Po-tao and Wu Sun-fu were lounging on\\ntheir sofas with their cigars and pulling the strings that made\\nthese puppets dance! As for herself, she now held the secrets\\nof the two string-pullers in the palm of her hand. All these\\nmen here were fighting in the dark, and she alone knew what\\nwas going on: what an immense joke it all was!\\n\\nShe wriggled her hips and twisted her lips into a smile.\\nHow little did the men sitting around her realize what a fabulous\\nsecret she had! Red-faced, their bloodshot eyes staring, they\\nsat there jabbering and arguing, while the veins stood out like\\ncords on their temples. The odd one or two sat alone, their\\nheads bent in silence; you knew at once that they had fought\\nand lost. Their lack-lustre eyes stared hopelessly into a wretched\\nfuture as they contemplated selling their property, or abscond-\\ning, leaving their debts unpaid.\\n\\nOn a bench opposite Liu Yu-ying two men, one with a droop-\\ning moustache and the other with a toothbrush moustache, were\\nconversing in conspiratorial whispers. She recognized the first as\\nFeng Mei-ching’s father, Feng Yun-ching. The old man’s blotchy\\nface wore a hang-dog look as he listened in silence to his com-\\npanion whispering on and on. Suddenly, a round-faced man in\\nhis forties squeezed his way out of the crowd and staggered into\\nthe “rear hospital” area. He rushed up to Feng Yun-ching and\\nyelled:\\n\\n“yun-ching, Yun-ching! They’re going up now! Ten cents,\\nfifteen cents, twenty cents! A steady rise! How about it? Shall\\nwe buy in ten thousand?”\\n\\n“Ha ha ha!’ Feng Yun-ching’s companion chimed in. “ ‘Buy,’\\nhe says! I’m for selling out twenty or thirty thousand, myself!”\\n\\nHe stood up with the intention of squeezing his way through\\nto the “front” again. He was in his thirties and had a fashionable\\ntoothbrush moustache, and his face seemed familiar to Liu Yu-\\n\\nying. While Feng Yun-ching was hesitating what to do, the\\nround-faced man squeezed back into the crowd and craned his\\nneck to see the quotations flashing out one after another on the\\nboard in the distance. The man with a toothbrush moustache\\nurged Feng Yun-ching:\\n\\n“Well, now, what about selling out twenty thousand? The\\nprices have been rising steadily for three days now—they must\\nturn and come down again soon!”\\n\\n“Oh dear! You say they’re going to drop, and Shen-an says\\nthey’re going to keep rising. I think I’ll give them another day\\nand see what happens then.”\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching’s face was flushed as he hastily made this\\nreply. Now the raund-faced was squeezing his way back again,\\nhis mouth awry.\\n\\n“They’re falling again!” he shouted. “They’re back to the open-\\ning price again!”\\n\\nImmediately, the man with the toothbrush moustache snorted\\nwith exasperation, sprang to his feet and fought his way fran-\\ntically into the crowd. Feng Yun-ching sat speechless, his eyes\\nstaring. The round-faced man edged up to him and panted,\\n“It’s a queer go, Yun-ching! It looks as if two strong groups\\nof bulls and bears are fighting tooth and nail!”\\n\\n“You\\'re telling me! That’s why I prefer to wait and see for\\na while. But you know, Shen-an, Chuang-fei’s been complaining\\nthat I didn’t have the courage to sell short on the fourth. Now\\nhe’s even more annoyed that I won’t unload a few. He says\\nI’m making a big mistake. ... As a matter of fact, since we\\nthree are in it together, I’m ready to do what the majority want.\\nIf you and Chuang-fei are agreed, there’s nothing I can say!”\\n\\n“Oh, no, it’s not like that at all!” protested the man they\\ncalled Shen-an, knitting his brows and sitting down in the empty\\nspace beside Feng Yun-ching. “Since the prices keep fluctuating\\nlike this, I agree with you that it would be better to wait and\\nsee,”\\n\\nHaving heard and understood all that passed between them,\\nLiu Yu-ying could not help smiling again. She looked down\\nat the hollow of her palm, in which she seemed to be holding\\nthe fate of three men with three different hearts but bound\\ntogether in a common endeavour. But no, they were not the\\n\\nonly three! She held in the palm of her hand the fates of every\\none of these men who were sweating and fighting over “Reor-\\nganization and Disbandment” in a seething mass before her!\\nShe stood up impulsively, moved unselfconsciously across to\\nFeng Yun-ching, and greeted him in a crystal-clear voice.\\n\\n“Good morning, Mr. Feng! How’s your luck today?”\\n\\n“Ah! Miss Liu!—Ah, I knew there was something I wanted\\nto ask you: have you seen Mei-ching about? The day before\\nyesterday she—”\\n\\n“Ah, I’M tell you all about it later on,” replied Liu Yu-ying\\nwith a winning smile, casually flashing a sideway glance at\\nHo Shen-an. “The market’s gone mad today, hasn’t it? I hope\\nyou\\'re not going to miss this chance of making a fortune, Mr.\\nFeng!”\\n\\nAll of a sudden, an uproar arose in the centre of the scrimmage\\n—not an ordinary one following a new quotation, but a deafening\\nroar that rose above the usual hubbub. Immediately, those at\\nthe “front” surged backwards like a tidal wave, while many in\\nthe tightly crowded “rear hospital” sprang to their feet and tried\\nto make their way forward and some stood on the benches to\\nsee what was happening. Feng Yun-ching and Ho Shen-an were\\nscared to death.\\n\\n“The barrier’s given way!” shouted someone up in the gallery\\nabove the platform, cupping his hands around his mouth and\\nleaning out over the balustrade. “Keep calm, there’s nothing to\\nworry about! It’s only the barrier collapsed!”\\n\\n“Oh, they’re off their heads—it’s worse than a battlefield!”\\nsighed Liu Yu-ying. She laid her hand on her chest, and found\\nthat her gauze dress, which had half dried out while she had\\nbeen sitting there, had suddenly become wet through with per-\\nspiration again. The panic soon passed and the Exchange resumed\\nits normal round of struggle and turmoil, with every man fighting\\ndesperately to snatch a victory before the close of the session.\\nHo Shen-an turned to Liu Yu-ying and said with a smile:\\n\\n“I’m sure I’ve met you before, Miss Liu. Do you come here\\noften? Are you expecting a rise or a drop? I think it’s going\\nto be a rise.”\\n\\n“And some people are expecting a slump! But tell me,\\nMr. Feng, how much are you in for? All going well, I hope?”\\n\\n“Ch, nothing big, nothing big. There’s three of us in it—just\\ntwo hundred thousand dollars or so between us. At the moment\\nwe\\'re neither gaining nor losing anything. We\\'re waiting to see\\nwhich way things go in the next ten days.”\\n\\n“Are you buying?”\\n\\n“Surely. Mr, Feng thinks that for the last six months the\\nbears have been out of luck, and I must say I agree with him.\\nWhen we had that big drop around the middle of last month,\\neverybody thought that government issues were heading for a\\nslump, so it came as a great surprise when the prices shot up\\nagain at the end of the month.—I say, Miss Liu, have you heard\\nabout that fellow Chao Po-tao? He’s never made a mistake yet,\\nand they say he’s buying again this time!”\\n\\nHo Shen-an lowered his voice to a whisper as he said this,\\nand stretched out his neck and put his mouth to Liu Yu-ying’s\\near—perhaps because he thought it was a secret, or perhaps\\nbecause she was so attractive and he could not resist doing it.\\nAll this left her quite unmoved, but she glanced sideways at\\nhim and acknowledged the tip with a smile. She suddenly\\nremembered her plan for “selling her secret retail.” Here was an\\nopportunity, so why shouldn’t she try it out? After all, Feng\\nYun-ching was not a stranger. She decided to drop a hint straight\\naway.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s quite right. But I’ve heard something else—”\\n\\n“Er, Miss Liu, what about Mei-ching?” interrupted Feng Yun-\\nching just at the crucial moment. His dark face flushed slightly,\\nand Liu Yu-ying noticed it at once. An idea suddenly struck\\nher. She tugged at his sleeve and whispered in his ear:\\n\\n“Didn’t you know? She’s busy with some little scheme or other!\\nI met her at Chao Po-tao’s place only a short while ago. It looks\\nas if he’s making a pot of money again this month—several\\nhundred thousand dollars, I expect! I know him, he—oh, Mr.\\nFeng, you didn’t say you were buying, did you? oh dear—”\\n\\nShe suddenly stopped and turned to smile at him. She had\\nsaid as much as she dared, and the hint was as plain as a hint\\ncould be, but Feng Yun-ching just sat there, flushed and silent,\\nwith not a glimmer of response in his eyes. When he heard that\\nhis daughter was actually at Chao Po-tao’s, his mind had been\\nplunged into an absolute turmoil: his hopes of her success, his\\n\\nsense of shame, which had not yet been completely crushed, and\\nhis fear that the prize might slip from his grasp—all these emo-\\ntions made a simultaneous impact on his mind at that moment,\\nand he had just not taken in the rest of what Liu Yu-ying had\\nsaid.\\n\\n“Now I want you to get this straight, Mr. Feng,” she said,\\nstill in a whisper. She had decided to stop beating about the\\nbush, and to come directly to the point. “Liu Yu-ying has never\\nyet been known to double-cross anybody, and I don’t ask much:\\na very small reward will do the trick!”\\n\\nThis time he heard every word, but, having lost the thread\\nof what she was saying, he had no idea what she meant and just\\nsat staring at her blankly. Just then, their conversation was\\ninterrupted.\\n\\nA sudden change had taken place on the floor of the Exchange.\\nThe hubbub of business transactions, a deafening roar of voices\\nconsisting almost wholly of shouted figures—such as five thousand,\\nten thousand, fifty thousand, a hundred thousand, or it might\\nbe ten cents, fifteen cents, one dollar—had given way to the sort\\nof babel of voices, interspersed with roars of laughter and sighs,\\nthat one hears in a theatre. Those at the “front” drifted away,\\nand some left the floor altogether. Trading in “Reorganization\\nand Disbandment” had closed with a rise of half a dollar.\\n\\n“The Seventh-Year Long Term” appeared on the board above\\nthe platform. This old government loan was followed by others\\nissued by the former régime in Peking, none of them attracting\\nmuch interest from speculators or forming the main line of\\nbusiness of the Exchange. The warlike “thunder of figures” had\\nabated and quite a number of people had left. Li Chuang-fei,\\nthe man with a toothbrush moustache, now hurried elatedly\\nback, his face bathed in sweat. He glanced at Ho Shen-an, slapped\\nFeng Yun-ching on the back, and bellowed:\\n\\n“The closing price was half a dollar up! Whatever you say\\nabout it, I’ve got rid of ten thousand!”\\n\\n“Good heavens, man! What on earth possessed you to do that?”\\nshrieked Ho Shen-an, leaping to his feet. One would have\\nthought Li Chuang-fei had just sliced a hunk of flesh off him.\\nFeng Yun-ching said nothing but just sat staring blankly.\\n\\n“What\\'s the matter with that? You know me: all straight and\\nabove-board! If it goes up again, I’ stand the loss. If it drops,\\nwill you pay the difference?”\\n\\n“That\\'s all right by me, but what are we going by: tomorrow’s\\nclosing price or the last price before the settlement?”\\n\\nHo Shen-an and Li Chuang-fei threw themselves into a heated\\nargument. Feng Yun-ching was still engrossed in his own wor-\\nries. He had decided on his plan of campaign; once he had\\nquestioned his daughter and discovered Chao Po-tao’s secret,\\nhe would know just how to proceed. When that time came,\\napart from the joint buying out of the pool of two hundred\\nthousand dollars, he was going to launch out on his own without\\nJetting on to his two partners.\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying had been listening in to Ho Shen-an and Li\\nChuang-fei with a deal of amusement.\\n\\n“Now, Chuang-fei! Surely you don’t believe all these so-called\\nstop-press reports? They’re rumours pure and simple! All these\\nclerks and assistants that you keep in your hotel, now they’re\\nthe sort of people who write these reports! You just show me\\nany one of their telegrams that they didn’t cook up out of their\\nown heads! How can you be so certain that the market’s going\\nbearish?”\\n\\n“It’s no good arguing with you. Time will tell who’s right.”\\n\\nLi Chuang-fei’s voice betrayed a slight uncertainty. Ho Shen-\\nan was about to press home his argument when someone squeezed\\nthrough the crowd and broke in:\\n\\n“Holding a court debate between a new and old magistrate?”\\n\\nIt was Han Meng-hsiang, the very man Liu Yu-ying had come\\nto see. He must have just caught sight of her in the distance\\nand come across.\\n\\nThe announcer on the platform banged with his gavel to open\\n“September the Sixth Loan,” which had long been worth hardly\\nmore than the paper it was printed on. Some business was\\ndone on it, nevertheless. The floor was quieter now than it had\\nbeen for a long time.\\n\\n“Ah! Yu-ying!” Han Meng-hsiang exclaimed, catching sight of\\nher and manoeuvring his way through to her. “So here you are!\\nHave you found Fatty yet? What a girl!—”\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying immediately tipped him a wink and motioned\\ntowards the others. Han Meng-hsiang smiled, and Liu Yu-ying\\ncasually moved towards him.\\n\\n“Have you any idea how much changed hands altogether this\\nsession?” Li Chuang-fei inquired of Han Meng-hsiang in a low\\nvoice, and shifted closer to him. The pair of them then drifted\\naway from the others and began conferring together in whispers,\\nwhile Feng Yun-ching and Ho Shen-an also settled down to a\\nprivate conversation. Suddenly Li Chuang-fei burst out laughing,\\nscurried past Han Meng-hsiang, and went across to talk with\\nsomeone by the platform.\\n\\nThe morning session was now over, only a dozen or so brokers\\nand customers remained, chatting in twos and threes. The\\ncleaners were sprinkling water on the floor and sweeping up the\\ncigarette-ends, From time to time a telephone would ring in the\\nbrokers’ offices. One man stood with notebook and pencil, peer-\\ning up at the quotation boards and jotting down the price-\\nchanges. These blackboards, chalked with figures, hung in a\\nneat row all along the latticed balustrade of the gallery. All\\nwas peaceful and calm—except the minds of the speculators,\\nwhich were still as tense as ever; during this short lull in the\\nfighting they were preparing for another fierce battle in the\\nafternoon.\\n\\n“I say!” whispered Li Chuang-fei to his two partners when he\\nreturned from his conversation with the man by the platform.\\n“Tu Kuang-shih says that Wu Sun-fu’s buying! I don’t understand\\nit at all! What do you make of it?”\\n\\nHis face, which had been glowing with elation before, was now\\npale with chagrin.\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching and Ho Shen-an exchanged glances but made\\nno comment. After a moment a whispered dispute broke out\\nbetween the three of them. It was short and sharp, and ended\\nwith Li Chuang-fei stalking out in high dudgeon. After he had\\ngone, first Feng Yun-ching and then Ho Shen-an left the Ex-\\nchange. As he passed through the main entrance Feng Yun-\\nching saw Liu Yu-ying and Han Meng-hsiang standing there\\nin conversation, and he had a sudden vision of his daughter Mei-\\nching, his “ray of hope” and the one “beacon” in the dark sea\\nof his bewilderment.\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying watched his retreating figure, her lips compressed\\ninto a contemptuous line.\\n\\n*\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching took a rickshaw home. He rode with closed\\neyes, for the wind, which was now flercer than ever, was blowing\\nstraight into his face, The trees lining the streets added their\\nstrident voices to the noise of the wind, and it seemed to Feng\\nYun-ching as he bowled along in the rickshaw that he could\\nstill hear the pandemonium on the floor of the Exchange. As\\nhe neared home he experienced an overwhelming anxiety. He\\nbegan to ask himself what he should do if Mei-ching had failed\\nin her mission, or if she had misunderstood. It had become a\\nmatter of life or death for him.\\n\\nOnce he was home, however, his anxiety passed. He had\\nfaith in his daughter, and faith also in the aid and protection\\nfor which he had prayed so earnestly to the spirits of his ancestors\\nthe night before last.\\n\\nThe first thing he asked the servant when he got in was:\\n“Has Mei-ching come home yet?” He had already decided that\\nif the answer was yes, it would be a good omen and the odds\\nwere that his luck had held. After all, Heaven helps those who\\nhelp themselves! As it turned out, his daughter had just re-\\nturned and was now asleep in her room. When he heard this,\\nhis pale, haggard face lit up with delight. Forgetting that he\\nwas tired and hungry, he immediately dashed upstairs.\\n\\nFinding the door of her room closed, he pulled up abruptly\\nand hesitated. He could not decide whether to knock and go in\\nor wait a while untif she was ready. He was naturally agog\\nto hear the precious news as soon as possible so that he would\\nbe free to get things going; but then she had only just got\\nback and her door was shut, so perhaps she wanted a little\\nprivacy—she might be changing or having a wash. If he butted\\nin at this inopportune moment he would most probably offend\\nthe God of Good Luck, and then his good luck would be changed\\nto bad!\\n\\nWhile he was standing there hesitating, his concubine suddenly\\nappeared with a bulging handbag in her hand, evidently just\\noff out.\\n\\n“Aht Just the man I want!” she shrilled. “I\\'ve got a bone to\\npick with you!”\\n\\nSo saying, she grabbed him by the ear and hauled him into\\nher room.\\n\\nA sheaf of bills was thrust into his hand: fortnight-old bills\\nfrom the rice-shop, the coal merchant, the car-hire people, the\\ngreengrocer, the tailor, and the confectioner. There were a\\ncouple of receipts among them — one from the Electricity Com-\\npany and one for last month’s rent. His eyes opened wide as he\\nwent through them one by one, and when he came to tot them\\nup in his head he found they came to about four hundred dollars.\\n\\n“But, Chiu, didn’t you tell the rice-shop, the coal merchant\\nand the car-hire people that we’ll settle up in full next quarter-\\nday?”\\n\\n“Bah! It\\'s all very well you standing there and saying that,\\nbut do you expect me to have the cheek to go and say it to them,\\ntoo? Let me tell you this: Ive paid all the pbills--every one\\nof them! Four hundred and thirty-one dollars odd—and I want\\nit back today!—I had to borrow the money of one of my friends!”\\n\\n“Oh, dear! Look, Chiu, give me a few days and I can let you\\nhave it. I’m hanged if I’ve got even a hundred dollars on me\\ntoday!”\\n\\nHe smiled placatingly and tucked the bills away in his pocket.\\n\\n“All right, then: if you can’t pay me in cash you can give\\nme the passbook for that ten thousand dollars in the Yuan Feng\\nBank and we\\'ll leave it at that.—Just as a pledge.”\\n\\n“Oh no, Chiu! I couldn’t do that! It wouldn’t be right! In\\nany case, it’s only a matter of four hundred dollars or so. You\\ncan’t expect a passbook for ten thousand dollars as a pledge\\nfor that amount—”\\n\\n“What do you mean ‘only four hundred dollars!’ You\\'re off\\nyour head! What about the five thousand dollars I borrowed for\\nyou from Wu? Four hundred indeed! She lent us that money\\nout of the kindness of her heart. She trusted us and didn’t\\neven ask for a security. The month will soon be up: I hope you’re\\nnot thinking of letting us down!”\\n\\nAs she spoke, the concubine arched her pencilled eyebrows,\\nand with every word she became angrier and more fearsome.\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching was doing his best to hold his apologetic smile.\\nSo far as the five-thousand-dollar loan was concerned, he had a\\nshrewd idea that all this talk about having borrowed the money\\nfrom Mr. Pai’s concubine Wu was just not true. He strongly\\nsuspected that it had come out of Chiu’s own savings, though it\\nwas more than he dared do to let on that he knew.\\n\\nShe gave him a few more lashes with the end of her tongue,\\nthen, realizing that it was getting late, she took herself off.\\n\\nWhen she had gone, Feng Yun-ching jumped up and stretched\\nas if he had just been granted an amnesty. He thought for a\\nmoment, then strode back to the door of his daughter’s room.\\nIt was now standing ajar. He gave a warning cough, then pushed\\nthe door open and walked in. Feng Mei-ching was sitting at her\\ndressing-table by the window, gazing into the mirror with a\\nfaraway look in her eyes. She turned and when she saw it was\\nher father she giggled and quickly buried her face in her arms\\non the dressing-table.\\n\\nOutside the window, the wind was whistling and blowing\\nagainst the bamboo screen, so that it tapped against the glass.\\n\\nAs he stood beside his daughter, Feng Yun-ching’s eyes moved\\nfrom her head of black hair and her snowy neck down over\\nto her slender, half-turned waist to her shapely legs, which were\\nstretched out sideways outside the leg of the dressing-table. Pres-\\nently, he heaved a satisfied-sounding sigh and asked quietly:\\n\\n“Well, Mei-ching, have you found out all about it?”\\n\\n“About what?” Mei-ching asked, lifting her head abruptly\\nand starting as if with surprise—no, not “as if’: her surprise\\nwas genuine, for she had clean forgotten about all her father’s\\ncareful instructions about finding an opportunity to get the re-\\nquired information from Chao Po-tao. It was not until her father\\nasked her about it that she suddenly remembered it.\\n\\n“Oh, Mei-ching, about government bonds, of course! Is he bull\\nafter all, or is he a bear?—”\\n\\n“Oh ... that!’ Mei-ching answered hesitantly, looking into her\\nfather’s face. “But Daddy, I don’t quite understand what you\\nmean.” Her mind was in a turmoil: should she tell her father\\nstraight out that she had not yet tried to find out, or should she\\njust beat about the bush and hope she could muddle through?\\n\\nOr should she simply make something up to put him off? She\\ndecided to try and muddle through.\\n\\n“you don’t understand what I mean? What don’t you under-\\nstand?”\\n\\n“Well, all this about ‘bulls’ and ‘bears.’ I\\'ve heard people\\ntalking about them, but I’m not quite sure what they mean.”\\n\\n“Ha ha! You must have found out about it, then! You silly\\ngirl! A ‘bull’ is a man who buys government bonds, and a ‘bear’\\nis a man who sells government bonds.”\\n\\n“Oh, then he must be a bull!” she said without hesitation, then\\ngiggled. She was not consciously telling a lie: after all, wasn’t\\nChao Po-tao a rich man? Only a rich man could afford to buy\\nthings, and anyone who had to sell things must be poor! Being\\nstill but a child at heart, she reasoned that if Chao Po-tao were\\nreduced to selling things, he would cease to be Chao Po-tao—at\\nleast, he would cease to be the Chao Po-tao that the women\\nwere fond of!\\n\\n“Er—are you quite sure? ‘You\\'re sure he’s a bull?” Feng Yun-\\nching insisted, fearing that he might have misheard. Even as he\\nspoke his leathery old face was beaming with delight and his\\nheart was pounding violently.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m certain of it!” she replied after a moment’s thought,\\nthen burst out giggling again and buried her face in her arms\\non the dressing-table as if to hide her embarrassment.\\n\\nJust then a sudden gust of wind lifted the bamboo screen out-\\nside the window. and banged it against the eaves. Then came a\\nfiercer gust still, which made the window rattle loudly.\\n\\nFeng Yun-ching was startled for the moment, but immediately\\ndecided this was a good omen; he remembered there was a prov-\\nerb which went something like this: “When a bamboo screen\\nflies up on to the roof, the master of the house is going to make\\na fortune.” Thereupon he decided to stake his all on one throw\\nof the dice: he was going in as a bull! He would even appro-\\npriate that sacred ten-thousand-dollar deposit which was set\\naside as his daughter’s dowry. He hurried out of her room and\\nwent straight out into the street.\\nXII\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s careless smile was fading and giving way to a\\nbrooding expression; his purplish, pimpled face twitched\\nslightly, and tiny beads of sweat gradually appeared on his tem-\\nples. Avoiding Liu Yu-ying’s eye, he sat looking sideways out\\nof the window and drawing crosses on the table-top with the mid-\\ndle finger of his right hand.\\n\\nA passer-by had apparently stopped just outside, for the\\nshadow of the top of a head had appeared on the patterned\\nwindow pane. The shadow moved away, and another one ap-\\npeared. Suddenly, there came the voice of a newsboy running\\nPast the window: “‘Stop-press News!’ Read all about it! Yen\\nHsi-shan orders his troops to the front! Big battle at Tehchow!\\nTsinan threatened! Read all about it! Circular telegram from\\nthe other side of the Great Wall!” Then came the voice of an-\\nother newsboy selling the “Stop-press News,” bawling as he ran\\npast.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s eyebrows jerked up, and he suddenly sprang to\\nhis feet and began pacing round the room. He stopped in front\\nof Liu Yu-ying and stood quite close to her, his piercing eyes\\nsearching her made-up face and boring into her eyes, which had\\na suspicion of dark rings under them, as if he hoped to see\\nthrough into the recesses of her mind.\\n\\nShe submitted to this scrutiny in unsmiling silence, patiently\\nwaiting for his next move.\\n\\n“Yu-ying, you must do as I tell you—” he said slowly and\\nquite firmly, without withdrawing his piercing gaze. Then he\\npaused as if to arrange his ideas in proper order before telling\\nher just what it was she was to do. Liu Yu-ying’s lips twisted\\ninto a smile as she realized she was “getting results.” Her heart\\npulsed with excitement and she could not help breaking in:\\n\\n“But Uncle, I hope you realize the difficulties of my position.”\\n\\n“Yes, I fully realize your position. You want to be sure you’ve\\ngot something to fall back on in case Chao Po-tao should find\\nyou out, don’t you? Well, you can leave that to me to take care\\nof. After all, we’re relations, and we ought to stand by one\\nanother. Now, listen, Yu-ying: first of all you must make sure\\nof Han Meng-hsiang. I’m sure you\\'ll be able to manage that\\nall right. And don’t—”\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying smiled again and blushed.\\n\\n“And don’t go ringing round everywhere trying to find me\\nin future, and don’t come to see me at the Yi Chung Trust\\nCompany! If you do, Chao Po-tao will soon find out that you\\'re\\nin touch with me and then he’ll be on his guard against you—”\\n\\n“Oh, I quite realize that. I was trying to get in touch with you\\nfor the first time today, and the only way I could do it was to\\nring up the different places. V’ll be very careful in future.”\\n\\n“Ah, I can see you’ve got your wits about you! Right, now\\nthe other thing is this: I want you to take a room in a nice\\nquiet hotel so that we\\'ll have somewhere to meet and talk things\\nover. I’ll come round to see you every evening about six o\\'clock,\\nso you be there waiting for me—can you manage it all right?”\\n\\n“Tm afraid I can’t make it every evening. I can never tell when\\nI’m going to be busy.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s all right—So long as you just give me a ring at\\nthe Yi Chung Company if you find you can’t get away.”\\n\\n“And what if you’re not there?”\\n\\n“Ym always there from four to five. If by any chance I’m\\nnot there, ask for Mr. Wang—Wang Ho-fu, H-o-f-u. You can\\nalways give him a message. You can’t mistake him: he’s a\\nnortherner and he always shouts.”\\n\\nLiu Yu-ying nodded and smiled understandingly. Suddenly\\nthe shadow of a head flashed across the patterned window-panes\\nagain, and then there was a thud as the head bumped against\\nthe window, almost knocking it open. Wu Sun-fu turned his head\\nsharply towards the window and looked slightly annoyed. By\\nnow, the shadows of two heads were visible, one higher than the\\nother, jerking to and fro. Suddenly suspicious, Wu Sun-fu moved\\nquickly over to the window and snatched it open to reveal two\\nangry faces glaring at each other with a fierce determination to\\n\\nfight it out if necessary. A couple of tramps quarrelling. Wu\\nSun-fu shrugged and closed the window, then returned to his seat\\nat the table and wrote out a cheque. As he handed it to Liu\\nYu-ying he said quietly:\\n\\n“And mind you don’t take a room like this: it’s too noisy! You\\nwant one upstairs and without a passage under the window.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, Ill arrange everything just right. Is that all,\\nUncle? There’s just one thing I’d like to mention—”\\n\\n“What\\'s that?” asked Wu Sun-fu, tilting his head and raising\\nhis eyebrows slightly.\\n\\n“You\\'ll have to get round Hsu Man-li and stick close to her\\nso that Chao Po-tao will go on suspecting her and giving her\\nthe cold shoulder. That’s the only way we can make sure that\\nshe doesn’t give me the lie and ruin my chances of seeing him\\nfrequently and finding out anything more. If you don’t know\\nher very well, you\\'ll have to hurry up and get to know her.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu puckered up his brows, but nodded all the same.\\n\\nOutside the window, the two tramps suddenly burst into streams\\nof abuse. They were apparently quarrelling about money. “Think\\nyou can double-cross me, eh? I’ll show you a thing or two!’’ The\\nvoice rose clear and loud, and when Wu Sun-fu heard it his frown\\ndeepened. Glancing at Liu Yu-ying, he shook himself and stood\\nup, but she was already making a second request.\\n\\n“One thing more, Uncle: I think I can manage Han Meng-\\nhsiang all right, but not if I have to rely on just talking him\\nround—we’ll have to make it worth his while. Chao Po-tao’s very\\nfond of ‘dollar diplomacy,’ you know! If you’re prepared to give\\nHan Meng-hsiang some encouragement, you must give me some\\nidea of how far you can go so that I can get to work on him at\\nthe first opportunity.”\\n\\n“Er—well, I can’t say for certain straight away—I’ll let you\\nknow in a day or two.”\\n\\n“Oh, and one other thing—” she began, then stopped and\\ngiggled. She blushed and flashed a glance at him.\\n\\n“Well, come on, let’s hear what it is,” he said hesitantly, notic-\\ning something peculiar about her smile and the look she gave\\nhim. He could not help feeling that this woman detective was\\nproving rather too much of a stickler for detail for his liking;\\nand, with things going the way they were, he was beginning\\n\\nto have his doubts about her—at least, he was not so sure he\\ncould handle her easily.\\n\\n“Well, it’s this: what shall I call you when you come to see me\\nin our private room?” she said softly. She made an apparent\\neffort to stop giggling, and her dark eyes gleamed seductively.\\n\\nWhen he heard what it was she wanted to know, he smiled\\nbriefly, but failed to notice her blatantly suggestive look. He drew\\na sigh of relief, then stood up and said indifferently, “We\\'re\\nrelations, so I shall still be ‘Uncle.’”\\n\\nSo saying, he waved her a perfunctory good-bye and hurried\\noff. As he drove away from the hotel, he became suddenly con-\\nscious of the suggestion implicit in her smile, her blushes and\\nthe look she had given him a moment ago, and his heart leapt\\nwildly; but the emotional disturbance was purely momentary,\\nand his thoughts returned immediately to Chao Po-tao and the\\nsubject of government bonds. When the chauffeur turned his\\nhead inquiringly, he just snapped:\\n\\n“The Stock Exchange—and fast!”\\n\\nIt was getting on for three o’clock, and a scorching sun had\\nsoftened the asphalted roadways, so that each passing car left\\nits pattern of tyre-marks imprinted on the surface. In the streets,\\ngrimy, perspiring tramps and urchins were hawking the various\\n“Stop-press editions,” bawling a bewildering variety of mutually\\ncontradictory headlines in an equal variety of voices.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu had flashed in and out of the Exchange and was\\ndriving to the Yi Chung Company offices. His mind was totally\\nabsorbed in plans for his various businesses, when suddenly he\\nrealized that he was full of serious contradictions himself. As an\\nindustrialist whose one great ambition was to help develop\\nChina’s own industry, he had all along objected on principle to\\nthe way financiers like Tu Chu-chai employed their large capital\\nsolely in speculation in real estate, gold bars, and government\\nbonds; yet he himself was now head over ears in government\\nponds! He had been hoping that a truly democratic régime would\\nsoon materialize in China, and so he had also hoped for a speedy\\nand successful conclusion of the military campaign being waged\\nby the Enlarged Conference of the North; but, now that he had\\n\\nheard from Liu Yu-ying that his rival Chao Po-tao was turning\\nbear and was preparing to resort to his “old methods” to snatch\\na victory, his main fear was that the campaign might be develop-\\ning too rapidly for his present purposes! The last thing he\\nwanted was to see any changes in the military situation in\\nShantung during the present month—that is to say, within the\\nnext five or six days. On top of this contradiction he had another:\\nhe had to use the limited capital in the Yi Chung Trust Company\\nboth for speculation in government bonds and for developing the\\neight recently-purchased factories. A month ago he had spared\\nno effort to lay his hands on Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons and up-to-\\ndate filatures, but now that he had succeeded, and had taken one\\nmore factory into his “iron hand,” he found it was something of\\na white elephant without the capital to run it, and was more\\ntrouble than it was worth.\\n\\nAll these contradictions had come upon him all at once and\\nso quickly that he had become deeply involved without realizing\\nwhat was happening. Although he was now fully aware of their\\nexistence, it was already too late to pull out. He knit his brows\\nin a tight frown and smiled wryly to himself.\\n\\nBut he was not a man to be easily daunted, for he had enough\\nconfidence in himself to see him through. Difficulties, he reas-\\nsured himself, were only stepping-stones to success, only hurdles\\nto be jumped. Was it not for the sake of foiling Chao Po-tao\\'s\\nconspiracy to establish a “finance trust” that he, Wu Sun-fu, was\\ndetermined to wrestle with him on the Exchange floor and defeat\\nhim there? This was the chief cause of all the trouble. Such\\nwas the “rational” interpretation Wu Sun-fu put on his contradic-\\ntions. There was just one problem that still worried him—that\\nof the Yi Chung Trust Company: he still had to find a practical\\nsolution to the problem of how to speculate in government bonds\\nand expand the eight factories at the same time. To make things\\nworse, there was not the slightest hope of dissuading Tu Chu-\\nchai from backing out of the company, and the loss of his support\\nwould prejudice the company’s chances of getting the help they\\nhad hoped to get from the banks. This presented the biggest\\ndifficulty of all at the moment: until he had cleared this obstacle,\\nthere was no point in considering his next step!\\n\\nThe car stopped and his train of thought stopped with it for\\nthe time being. As he hurried into the company building he was\\nworried, though not to the extent of despairing.\\n\\nAs he passed the counter, he noticed someone withdrawing a\\ndeposit and arguing heatedly with the cashier. What was the\\nmatter? he wondered. Was there anything wrong with the seal?\\nOr was the figure incorrect? Whatever it was, it could not\\nwarrant such a red-faced display of anger! Wu Sun-fu glanced at\\nthe customer with a frown, then dashed straight up the stairs\\nand burst into the general manager’s office. Although it was\\ncalled an office, it was furnished like a conference room, and\\nthe general manager’s actual office was a “private den” next\\ndoor to it. At that moment Wang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-jen were\\nengaged in a téte-a-téte in the conference room; when Wu Sun-\\nfu dashed in looking rather distraught, they sprang to their feet\\nin wide-eyed surprise. Wu Sun-fu smiled reassuringly, but was\\nin for a shock himself, for Wang Ho-fu immediately burst out:\\n\\n“So you’ve come, Sun-fu! We\\'ve run into a bit of trouble!\\nWe\\'ve been on the phone hunting for you high and low but\\ncouldn’t find you anywhere!”\\n\\n“He had a job chasing me up, too,” added Sun Chi-jen. His\\nvoice was as calm and unhurried as usual, but his face betrayed\\na certain anxiety. “We were just discussing what to do about\\nit. It’s not as serious as all that, but it’s come just at a time\\nwhen we’re pressed for money, so it’s a bit of a nuisance! The\\npoint is you know that loan of a hundred thousand dollars that\\nthe Yuan Ta Native Bank promised us last week? Well, now\\nthey’ve changed their minds—though they were very nice about\\nit, of course! Well, that’s the score.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was calmer now. Although the blow had fallen\\nrather earlier than he had counted on, it was not altogether\\nunexpected. Since the loan had been arranged through the good\\noffices of Tu Chu-chai, it was only natural that it would fall\\nthrough now that Tu Chu-chai had dropped out of the company.\\nCalming himself with an effort and temporarily dismissing from\\nhis mind the question of government bonds, Wu Sun-fu con-\\ncentrated his attention on the problem of bridging this sudden gap.\\n\\nThe loan had been intended to defray the payment of the wages\\nof the two thousand six hundred workers in the eight factories\\nand to buy new stocks of raw materials.\\n\\nWang Ho-fu brought out a pile of books and papers for Wu\\nSun-fu and Sun Chi-jen to look over, and gave them a brief\\nsumming-up:\\n\\n“The wages total a little over fifty thousand dollars. They’re\\npaid at the end of the month, which gives us five or six days’\\ngrace, so it’s not all that urgent. What really does matter is\\nthat we’ve taken delivery of certain raw materials—rubber,\\numbrella-rrames, electrical goods, turps and sulphuric acid—which\\ncome to over seventy thousand dollars altogether; and all the\\ngoods must be paid for within two or three days.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu, who had been deep in thought, stroking his chin\\nabsent-mindedly, glanced up at Sun Chi-jen. With the end of\\nthe month only a few days away, he himself had to find the\\nmoney to pay the workers in his own silk factory and also the\\none recently taken over from Chu Yin-chiu. “This meant he would\\nhave to do some fast thinking on his own account. His enterprises,\\nit was true, had multiplied, but never before had he found himself\\nso short of ready money. The total value of his assets had gone\\nup by leaps and bounds—at a conservative estimate, he put the\\nincrease at two hundred thousand dollars—but a hundred thou-\\nsand of this was locked up in the cocoons stowed away in a\\nwarehouse. On top of that, there had recently been a sharp\\ndrop in silk prices, so that he just could not afford to sell off his\\nstock of silk, which meant another one hundred thousand tied\\nup. To crown it all, more than a hundred thousand was frozen\\ndown in the country as a result of the peasant rising. Con-\\nsequently, the company’s present deficit, though it amounted to\\nno more than a hundred thousand, was proving an insurmountable\\ndifficulty however hard he racked his brains.\\n\\n“So we must have seventy thousand dollars within two or\\nthree days, eh? Well, just you leave it to me!—” This cheerful\\noffer to find the money came from Sun Chi-jen. As he said this,\\nhe glanced at Wu Sun-fu, for he was well aware of the latter’s\\nfinancial straits. He paused a moment to flick through the books\\nand papers, then went on:\\n\\n“Though of course all this robbing Peter to pay Paul won\\'t\\nprovide a permanent solution to the problem, even though it\\'ll\\ntide us over. Apart from the eight factories, we\\'ve got Chen\\nChun-yi’s silk goods manufactory on our hands on a one-year con-\\ntract, so that although you can’t say we\\'re going in for things\\nin a really big way, we’ve still got our hands full. This means\\nwe must have an over-all plan. We started with a paid-up\\ncapital of eight hundred thousand dollars, which we laid out\\non buying the old Yi Chung Trust Company together with the\\neight factories. Now that Tu Chu-chai’s withdrawn his share\\nof the capital, we’ve only got about four hundred thousand left,\\nand this has gradually become locked up in government bonds.\\nI was thinking, this small amount of capital is just not enough\\nto run the factories and speculate on the stock market, both at\\nthe same time. We\\'ll just have to drop one or the other of them.\\nThe trouble is, we’re in both things right up to the neck, and we\\ncan’t easily give up any one of them.”\\n\\n“Tf it’s just a question of keeping the eight factories running as\\nthey are now,” said Wang Ho-fu, “I think we might be able to\\nscrape through on four hundred thousand dollars; but I thought\\nwe\\'d decided to expand them? Besides, we\\'ve still got Chen\\nChun-yi’s silk goods manufactory to think about. No, I don’t\\nthink four hundred thousand would be enough! And what with\\nthe war disrupting communications, there’s no way of shipping\\nour products anywhere. We haven’t even been able to cover our\\noverheads this month. Yes, I agree with Chi-jen that we must\\nhave an over-all plan!”\\n\\nThe factories were Wang Ho-fu’s special responsibility, so it\\nwas the factories that he emphasized.\\n\\nWhile listening to his partners, Wu Sun-fu had been thinking\\nthings over, and now his face suddenly took on a look of deter-\\nmination. He glanced up at them, his eyes alight with courage\\nand optimism. The look in his eyes was the one which could\\nalways inspire his colleagues with enthusiasm, fire their im-\\nagination and steel their will; it was that look of compelling\\nintensity which came into his eyes whenever he was drawing\\nup some great plan or making an important decision, a look that\\nmade lesser mortals quake.\\n\\nJust as he was going to speak, however, there was suddenly\\na tap on the door.\\n\\n“Who’s that? Come in!” called Wang Ho-fu, turning towards\\nthe door and then rising from his seat with an air of impatience.\\n\\nThe head of the business department downstairs appeared.\\nHunched forward, he tiptoed lightly and swiftly across to Wang\\nHo-fu, and said in a low voice:\\n\\n“There’s someone else here who wants to withdraw his deposit\\nbefore the time’s up. We showed him our new regulations, but\\nhe wouldn’t take any notice. He said he was quite willing to\\nforfeit his four months’ interest. We suggested that he might\\ndiscount it, but he wouldn’t hear of it. He’s making a great deal\\nof noise at the counter. What should I do about it, sir?”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu snorted, and instead of replying he glanced round\\nat his two partners. Wu Sun-fu frowned, while Sun Chi-jen\\nrubbed his chin and smiled wryly. Wang Ho-fu turned to the\\nhead of the business department again and asked, “How much\\nis it?”\\n\\n“Ten thousand dollars.”\\n\\n“Oh, ten thousand, eh?—Oh, all right, let him have it. And\\ndon’t insist on discounting it, either. Oh, damn!”\\n\\nThe man nodded with a respectful smile and quickly tiptoed out\\nagain. The door, which was fitted with a Yale automatic closing\\ndevice, closed slowly and lightly behind him; there was a slight\\nthud, after which a deathly hush suddenly filed the room.\\n\\n“What a nuisance! It happens almost every day!’ muttered\\nWang Ho-fu to himself as he sat down again. Lighting a Garrick\\nand blowing out a cloud of smoke, he went on, “All these odds\\nand ends of deposits were passed over to us by our predecessors.\\nNow about sixty per cent of the total amount has been with-\\ndrawn.”\\n\\n“Oh!—What about the deposits we’ve taken in ourselves?”\\nasked Sun Chi-jen.\\n\\n“Oh, there’s enough to see us through,’”’ Wang Ho-fu replied,\\nleafing through the books. “Tang Yun-shan has roped in over a\\nhundred thousand dollars in deposits, some fixed and some cur-\\nrent. 1 think we have quite good prospects of absorbing more.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled, then suddenly his eyes smouldered. He\\nlooked from Wang Ho-fu to Sun Chi-jen, then said firmly:\\n\\n“ret’s send round a circular tomorrow informing the old de-\\npositors that we\\'ll accommodate them by permitting them to with-\\ndraw their deposits prior to maturity within the next fortnight\\nwith interest calculated on a daily basis. What do you say to that,\\nChi-jen? We\\'re just wasting our time messing about with these\\nodds and ends. There must be a reason for all these old deposi-\\ntors rushing to withdraw their money, and it’s my conviction that\\nthey’ve heard rumours that our credit isn’t good. And you know\\nwho our champion rumour-monger is—Chao Po-tao! Just now\\nhe’s doing everything he can to put a spoke in our wheel. He\\nsaid once that if the banks tightened their credit a little, we\\'d\\nbe done for. That was no idle threat: he’s up to his tricks\\nalready!”\\n\\n“you\\'re quite right!” Wang Ho-fu hurriedly put in. “The way\\nthe Yuan Ta Native Bank let us down today must have been\\nChao Po-tao’s work, too. I detected it in the way the manager\\nspoke this morning.”\\n\\n“And then again, look at this business of Tu Chu-chai. It ap-\\npeared on the face of it that the reason why he backed out of\\nthe company was that he couldn’t agree to the purchase of the\\neight factories. If the truth were known, it was because Chao\\nPo-tao had put the wind up him with his rumours. Tu Chu-\\nchai wouldn’t admit that to me, but it stood out a mile. When\\nhe found that Tang Yun-shan had left for Hongkong, he kept\\non at me to bring Shang Chung-li into the company, but I abso-\\nlutely refused, and the next day he decides to withdraw!”\\n\\n“sta ha! He’s rather timid, Tu Chu-chai is rather timid,” said\\nWang Ho-fu. “But, in all justice to him, he’s never shown any\\ngreat interest in running factories.”\\n\\nHe glanced at Sun Chi-jen, who nodded abstractedly. At this\\nmoment, a dark cloud was gradually settling on Sun Chi-jen’s\\nmind: he was no more keen on stock speculation than Tu Chu-\\nchai was on factories. Not that he was averse to speculation on\\nprinciple, but he already had quite enough to cope with, and felt\\nhe was not equal to speculation on top of his industrial enter-\\nprises. As it was, the company was deeply involved in both things,\\nand at every turn new dangers were looming up: it was becoming\\nmore and more evident that Chao Po-tao’s projected “financial\\nblockade” against the company had already been put into opera-\\n\\ntion. Things were so disheartening that he had come to the\\nconclusion that there was not much chance of their succeeding\\nin running the blockade. Still, they had no alternative but to\\npress on.\\n\\nIn spite of everything, Sun Chi-jen remained calm. Realizing\\nthat Wu Sun-fu was waiting for him to express his opinion and\\nthat Wang Ho-fu had no definite views of his own, he looked\\ncalmly into Wu Sun-fu’s purplish face, which now looked alert\\nand excited, and said in his usual unhurried way:\\n\\n“If we put our own house in order, we’ve got nothing to\\nbe afraid of. Credit is credit, and rumours are only rumours:\\nwe mustn’t let ourselves get flustered. I quite agree with Sun-\\nfu that we shouldn’t waste our time on trifles, and that since the\\nold depositors have been swallowing rumours we ought to send\\nout the circular and make them sit up with a jerk. But the first\\nthing we must do is to put ourselves in a strong position by re-\\norganizing the factories and putting them on a firm footing. Now,\\nlet’s get it clear in our minds which of the factories can be over-\\nhauled so as to cut down costs, and which of them should be\\nexpanded and the minimum amount of extra capital that would\\ntake. Ho-fu’s just said that four or five hundred thousand dollars\\nwon’t be enough, so even if we withdraw the capital now in-\\nvested in government bonds we’ll still be short and we\\'ll have to\\nfind some way of making it up. But just how much is needed for\\nexpansion? How much can be saved on overheads? And how\\nmuch must we be prepared to lose during the next two or three\\nmonths due to a possible dull market? We must work out re-\\nalistic figures to cover all these things.”\\n\\n“The cost of expansion has already been worked out in detail,”\\nreplied Wang Ho-fu, for the factories were principally his re-\\nsponsibility. “It comes to a total of three hundred thousand\\ndollars for the eight factories together. And that’s an absolute\\nminimum!”\\n\\nAs he said this he was wondering to himself how their govern-\\nment bonds were faring, since all the company’s ready money\\nof three hundred thousand dollars was invested in bonds. He\\nturned to Wu Sun-fu and was just going to ask about the state\\nof the stock market, when Wu Sun-fu forestalled him:\\n\\n“As for the whole of the company’s capital going into govern-\\nment bonds, we just had no choice in the matter: on the third\\nwe just bought a million, in the hope of making a bit while the\\ngoing was good, but when the situation changed after that, we\\nhad to hold out in spite of ourselves until we actually turned\\nbulls. At the moment we\\'re holding ten million in bonds. At\\nthis morning’s closing price we ought to be able to net around\\nthree hundred thousand dollars, which isn’t too bad. Before I\\ncame round here I told our broker to sell five million first thing\\nthis afternoon.”\\n\\nThe light of victory shone in Wu Sun-fu’s eyes, and he rubbed\\nhis hands with glee.\\n\\n“But Sun-fu,” Wang Ho-fu chimed in hastily, looking as gleeful\\nas Wu Sun-fu, “don’t you think the rise will probably continue?\\nEver since the fifteenth prices have been rising steadily, even\\nthough it’s only been a matter of twenty or thirty cents a day.”\\n\\n“Tt wouldn’t be too sure about that!” Wu Sun-fu replied. He\\nwas smiling, but his voice was perfectly serious. He turned and\\nlooked at Sun Chi-jen with such a look of determination and\\nconfidence in his eyes as would have made the most hesitant of\\nmen decide there and then to follow him. He now spoke rapidly\\nand clearly, and every word went home:\\n\\n“Yes, the first thing we must do is to make sure our feet are\\non firm ground! We\\'re fighting a battle, a battle against two\\nenemies, one in front and one behind. Our enemy to the front\\nis competition from the Japanese factories in Shanghai; the\\nenemy to our rear is Chao Po-tao; and before we can get our\\nfeet on firm ground, we\\'ll have to beat both of them! As soon\\nas we possibly can we must put the eight new factories into\\ndecent shape by tightening up on the management, putting really\\nefficient men in key positions, drastically cutting down waste of\\nmaterials, getting rid of redundant office staff and sacking any\\nundesirable elements among the workers! I don’t doubt for one\\nmoment that the budget for every one of these factories could\\nbe cut by twenty per cent!”\\n\\n“Right-o, then,” said Sun Chi-jen calmly, apparently ignoring\\nthe first and more important part of Wu Sun-fu\\'s remarks, “let’s\\ncut their budgets by twenty per cent as from next month! So\\nfar as the present office staff is concerned, I’ve thought all along\\n\\nthat they’re practically useless, but it’s so difficult to get hold\\nof competent people just now that we’ve had to keep them on;\\nbut now we must come down on them hard. Ho-fu, you’re down\\ninspecting the factories practically every day, so you must have\\nsome idea who should be the first to go.”\\n\\nThe gleam in Wu Sun-fu’s eyes—the gleam of optimism and\\ndetermination to fight it out with Chao Po-tao—was now re-\\nflected in Sun Chi-jen’s eyes. This was not lost on Wu Sun-fu,\\nwho seized the opportunity to press his argument home:\\n\\n“T was telling you just now that we had got rid of half of our\\nten-million holding of bonds. Even so, it’s going to be a close\\nthing, because Chao Po-tao’s all set to ‘kill the bulls.’ For-\\ntunately for us, his secret leaked out today—-someone who\\'s\\nwell in with him sold me the information for a mere two thousand\\ndollars and promised to keep us informed of his activities into\\nthe bargain! Chao Po-tao’s plan is to knock the bottom out\\nof the market just before the settlement at the end of the\\nmonth, But he little thought that we should unload half of\\nour holdings today! Tomorrow we\\'ll get rid of the rest, and\\nChao Po-tao’s little scheme will be knocked for six!”\\n\\nAs he was speaking, Wu Sun-fu sprang to his feet. He looked\\nfor all the world like some great general telling the story of a\\ndecisive battle he had won, and he was almost watering at the\\neyes with excitement. He smiled at his two partners and added,\\n“We\\'ve got a better chance of beating Chao Po-tao now than\\nwe\\'ve ever had!”\\n\\nThe question of reorganizing the factories was then temporarily\\nshelved, and their discussion concentrated on Chao Po-tao and\\ngovernment bonds. Wu Sun-fu had won his victory. He first put\\nhis own defence line in order: he made Sun Chi-jen and Wang\\nHo-fu realize that to speculate in government bonds and expand\\nthe factories at the same time, far from being a contradiction,\\nwas in fact a necessary step towards success; he explained to\\nthem that if would be suicidal to adopt a passive policy of “self-\\nsufficiency”—in other words, to try to manage without financial\\nassistance from the bankers; and he showed them that they\\nmust defeat Chao Po-tao and run the “blockade” he had engineered\\nbefore they could really be sure of being able to stand their\\nground. In the end, Wu Sun-fu had succeeded in increasing his\\n\\npartners’ knowledge of Chao Po-tao and ensuring their animos-\\nity towards him, thus transforming the Yi Chung Trust Com-\\npany into the headquarters of the “anti-Chao camp.”\\n\\nFinally, they returned to the subject of reorganizing the fac-\\ntories. In view of what had just been said, their efforts in this\\ndirection were naturally redoubled. The reduction of staff, a\\nwage-cut, the increasing of working hours, besides a new set of\\ndraconian regulations for putting the factories under the strictest\\ncontrol, were all proposed and decided on in principle in little\\nmore than ten minutes.\\n\\n“Between three and five hundred workers to be discharged,\\nthen,” began Wang Ho-fu, summing up, “Sunday overtime to be\\nabolished; working day to be extended by one hour without ad-\\nditional pay; workers to be searched at the gate, both when\\ncoming in and going out; ten per cent of the monthly wage to\\nbe deducted by the management and retained as a deposit up\\nto a maximum of sixty-five dollars for each worker, to be re-\\nfunded in the event of discharge.... I think all these regula-\\ntions can come into force immediately. Now, the last item—a\\nten per cent wage-cut—well, I’m afraid they’li kick up rough\\nabout that! The stopping of Sunday overtime is already as good\\nas a ten per cent wage-cut. If we knock off another ten per\\ncent on top of that, it’s going to be the last straw, and it’s quite\\nlikely they’ll come out on strike, which will put us in a tight\\nspot. I propose we shelve this suggestion for the time being—\\nwhat do you say?”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu scratched his head and looked hesitantly at Wu\\nSun-fu, whose face was tense.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled, but before he could answer Sun Chi-jen\\nbutted in, his voice betraying an unwonted excitement:\\n\\n“No no, I can’t agree with you, Ho-fu! I think we\\'re strict\\nwhere we must be, and more liberal than other people wher-\\never we can afford to be. Have you forgotten that we’re going\\nto grant a special bonus to those workers who exceed the norm\\nwhich we set? Take the electric light bulb factory, for instance:\\nthe present daily quota for each worker is two hundred bulbs,\\nwhich is really a very considerate norm; but a skilful, conscien-\\n{ious man can easily make two hundred and fifty a day. If he\\n\\ndoes, we\\'ll give him a bonus of fifteen cents, which will mean that\\nover a month he’ll earn more than he ever did in the past.”\\n\\n“Yes, Chi-jen, I must agree with you that we do very well by\\nour workers,” said Wang Ho-fu, who was not to be silenced so\\neasily. “But you must remember they’re a very unreasonable\\nlot: if you cut their wages, they notice it; if you offer them a\\nbonus, they don’t! Now, don’t think I’m afraid of trouble, Sun-\\nfu, but I really do think we should give the matter our careful\\nconsideration.”\\n\\nBeing in charge of the eight factories, Wang Ho-fu was aware\\nof signs of unrest that had existed among the two thousand-odd\\nworkers in them for some time.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu and Sun Chi-jen said nothing for the moment, and\\nthe room was again plunged into a silence broken only by the\\nintermittent rumbling of trams passing under the windows,\\nthrough which the rays of the setting sun picked out the snowy\\ntablecloth and the sofa covers in a blaze of golden light.\\n\\nA look of intense absorption and concentration had appeared\\non Wu Sun-fu’s face. He was not worrying about a possible\\nstrike, for he was always having one sort of trouble or another\\nin his own factory, and every time he had settled it without\\nmuch difficulty. There was one thing he had learned from these\\nexperiences, however: that one must have loyal and competent\\nexecutives in one’s factory if one is to come out on top. At pres-\\nent, he had not any such “good” staff for any of the company’s\\neight factories, and the problem was made all the more difficult\\nby the fact that there was no co-ordination between the eight\\nfactories. No, Wang Ho-fu’s fears could not be dismissed just\\nlike that!\\n\\nIt so happened that what Sun Chi-jen next said showed that\\nhe and Wu Sun-fu had been thinking along exactly the same\\nlines.\\n\\n“Yes, I think it would be all right to leave the question of a\\nwage-cut open for a month or so; but there’s no getting away\\nfrom the fact that the executive staffs of the factories must be\\nreshuffled at once! Young hotheads and old stick-in-the-muds\\nmust all go to make way for new blood! I was wondering if\\nyou could spare a few men from your own factory, Sun-fu? We\\nmust set ourselves a time-limit of one month to complete the\\n\\nstaff changes, and then during the following month we can an-\\nnounce the wage-cut. But the bonus system should be introduced\\nwithout delay, so that the workers realize that we\\'re playing fair\\nwith them and that those who are more highly skilled and whc\\nwork hard can earn a nice fat pay-packet!”\\n\\nAs he listened, Wu Sun-fu nodded his approval. Then, all of\\na sudden, there came the sound of heavy, hurried footsteps pound.\\ning right up to the office door, and the agitated voice of the office\\nboy: “Who do you want to see? You can’t go rushing in just\\nlike that!” The three men in the room looked up in surprise just\\nas the door flew open and their visitor burst in; he had a bulging\\nbriefcase under his arm, and his face was bathed in perspiration.\\nHe kicked the door to behind him, and as he marched across\\nthe room he rapped out, “Yen Hsi-shan’s army’s on the march’\\nTehchow’s in a state of chaos! How’s Tang Yun-shan getting\\non in Hongkong? Have you heard from him yet?”\\n\\nThe intruder was Huang Fen, the famous blusterer.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu\\'s face fell, but Wang Ho-fu laughed as he jumpec\\nup and asked quickly, “Is that true? When did you hear about\\nit?”\\n\\n“Only half an hour ago — ’course it’s true!” Huang Fen gasped\\nthumping the briefcase under his arm as much as to say thal\\nhe had the important news stowed safely away in it, so there\\ncould be no mistake about it. “Had a wire from Yun-shan yet?’\\n\\n“How about Tsinan?” Wu Sun-fu asked hastily, his bushy eye-\\nbrows now quivering with agitation. “Surely they’ll have a big\\nbattle on their hands when they get to Tsinan?”\\n\\n“They\\'ll take Tsinan in a matter of four or five days. Nc\\nquestion of a big battle there; the heaviest fighting will be along\\nthe southern part of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway!”\\n\\n“A matter of four or five days, eh?” Wu Sun-fu muttered tc\\nhimself. “And no heavy fighting!”\\n\\nHe laughed hysterically, then stepped back and flopped on tc\\na sofa: his face had suddenly become quite ashen and a look o:\\nferocity had come into his eyes. The military situation along\\nthe northern part of the Tientsin-Pukow line was changing muct\\ntoo rapidly!—So rapidly, in fact, that even he could not keer\\npace with it, for all his alertness and agility!\\n\\nThe significance of the news had also struck Sun Chi-jen; he\\nheaved a deep sigh, then glanced from Wu Sun-fu to the clock\\non the wall: just on four o’clock. His thoughts immediately went\\nto the Exchange: perhaps at this very minute prices were plung-\\ning down to the limit amid the frantic yelling of the crowd! His\\nheart pounded wildly, and he dared not think about it any more.\\n\\n“Can’t understand you not hearing from Yun-shan!” said Huang\\nFen, turning to go as abruptly as he had come. “Let me know\\nthe moment you hear anything, Ho-fu!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu sprang to his feet again, his teeth clenched tightly\\ntogether and his eyes glaring. He paced savagely round the\\nroom, then suddenly wheeled round, stopped in front of an ap-\\nprehensive Wang Ho-fu and a mournful, brooding Sun Chi-jen,\\nand said in an excited, agitated voice, “So far as I can see there\\'s\\nonly one thing we can do—bribe the brokers to bring the settle-\\nment forward two days! Didn\\'t Huang Fen say that they\\nwouldn’t be in Tsinan for four or five days yet? Let’s say four\\ndays; that means that if we can bring the settlement forward two\\ndays we can just get it in before Tsinan falls, so that for all the\\nrumours there won’t be too rapid a slump. If the settlement’s\\nadvanced by two days, that’ll mean that the account will be\\nclosed in three days’ time. The bears won\\'t be able to do much\\ntomorrow, and tomorrow we’ll get rid of our remaining five mil-\\nlion. If we can work it like this, we should be able to break\\neven.—Hm-m, I wonder what they’re up to now, suddenly put-\\nting in a whole army like that?”\\n\\n“Still, we’re lucky to have heard about it in time,” said Sun\\nChi-jen. “It was the same last month: we heard in good time\\nabout Chang Fa-kuei and the Kwangsi armies evacuating Chang-\\nsha, and so we were able to save ourselves before the rot set in.”\\n\\nHe said this partly to express his agreement with Wu Sun-fu’s\\nsuggestion, and partly to give himself what consolation he could.\\n\\n“Sun-fu, I think you\\'re right! Let’s get cracking straight\\naway!”\\n\\nNow that he had caught on to the idea, Wang Ho-fu was his\\nusual cheerful self again; he had faith in Wu Sun-fu’s resource-\\nfulness in a crisis.\\n\\n“All right,” replied Wu Sun-fu, “I’ll ring up Lu Kuang-shih and\\nask him to come round straight away. ‘Man proposes, God dis-\\n\\nposes. I think ten thousand dollars would probably do the\\ntrick.”\\n\\nHis voice was calmer now, and as he spoke he looked up at\\nthe clock with puckered brows. Never, he thought, was the prov-\\nerb “An inch of time is an inch of gold” more true than now.\\nHe smiled grimly and hurried into the “private den” next door\\nto ring up the broker.\\n\\nWang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-jen sat silent. The latter gazed at\\na vase on the table in front of him, and then up at the chart on\\nthe wall: “Plans for Industrial Development.” He was still fairly\\ncalm, except that he kept stroking his chin. Wang Ho-fu, how-\\never, was fidgety. He went across to the window and stood look-\\ning out for a moment, then suddenly came back and pressed the\\nbell. After a moment a young clerk poked his head round the\\ndoor and looked inquiringly at Wang Ho-fu, who beckoned him\\nin and indicated that he should sit down at a Chinese type-\\nwriter under the window. When the typist had sat down, Wang\\nHo-fu said:\\n\\n“Now, type as I dictate. ‘New Bonus System. As an experi-\\nment...in scientific management... with a view to increasing\\nproduction. ...’—-Come on, slow-coach! Can’t you go quicker than\\nthat? “—with a view to increasing production...and in order to\\nencourage good workers...we have decided...to adopt... the\\nfollowing new system....’ Come on, don’t dawdle!...‘the fol-\\nlowing new system’—got it? Now, new paragraph. ...”\\n\\n“What\\'s the news, Sun-fu?” Sun Chi-jen suddenly demanded.\\nWang Ho-fu abandoned his typist and whirled round to find Wu\\nSun-fu standing by the table, his hands clasped in front of his\\nchest and a look of exasperation on his face. Wang Ho-fu grunted,\\nthen turned and snapped at the typist\\'s back:\\n\\n“That\\'s all! You can go now!”\\n\\nWhen the three of them were alone again, Wu Sun-fu muttered\\nthrough clenched teeth, “Half a dollar down already!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu felt the blood freeze in his veins, and Sun Chi-jen\\nheaved a sigh. Wu Sun-fu took a couple of steps forward, his\\nhead on his chest. When he looked up again, his eyes were\\nflerce.\\n\\n“The session closed with a drop of half a dollar,” he muttered.\\n“Qur five million was unloaded first thing, when the quotation\\n\\nwas even five cents higher than the closing quotation of the\\nmorning session. After that, the rot set in. We\\'ll probably make\\na profit of about a hundred and twenty or thirty thousand dollars\\non the first five million, but it’s a job to say whether we’ll make\\nanything on the other five million. ‘Man proposes, God disposes.’ ”\\n\\n“Don’t you believe it!” said Sun Chi-jen. He forced a smile,\\nbut his voice trembled slightly. “There’s still tomorrow! Let’s\\npush ahead with our original plan. It’s man that does the dis-\\nposing!”\\n\\n“That’s quite right!” echoed Wang Ho-fu, though without Sun\\nChi-jen’s smile. “It’s man who does the disposing, and we\\'ve\\nstill got tomorrow!”\\n\\nSuddenly he turned, pulled the unfinished notice about the\\n“bonus system” out of the typewriter and flourished it at his\\npartners.\\n\\n“As for the factories,” he cried, “we\\'ll get cracking on them\\ntomorrow: discharge of three to five hundred workers, no work-\\ning overtime on Sundays, working day to be increased by one\\nhour without extra pay, a deposit to be stopped out of wages,\\nand last but not least...a ten-per-cent wage-cut! Ill put up\\nthe notice tomorrow morning. And if the workers cut up rough?\\nHuh! We\\'ll bloody well close down the factories for a couple\\nof weeks and see how they like that! And, of course, all this\\nwill apply to the silk goods factory on loan from Chen Chun-yi!”\\n\\n“That’s the stuff! ‘Man disposes!’ Go ahead, Ho-fu!’’ Wu Sun-\\nfu and Sun Chi-jen simultaneously voiced their approval. Three\\npairs of eyes now gleamed with an iron determination to squeeze\\nout of the nine factories, by every means in their power, compen-\\nsation for their possible loss on the Stock Exchange: it was their\\nonly way out!\\n\\n*\\n\\nIt was nine o’clock when Wu Sun-fu arrived home. He was\\ndead-beat. It was a muggy evening, with a sky full of stars,\\nand a slender, almost invisible crescent moon. Only in the shade\\nof the trees was there any suggestion of a breeze. His wife and\\nseveral others had come out into the garden for a breath of fresh\\nair, leaving the house in darkness except for two lighted windows\\non the second floor, so that the building looked like some great\\n\\nmonster crouching in the gloom, while the two windows were\\nits gleaming, ravening eyes.\\n\\nMrs. Wu and her three companions were sitting under the trees\\nfringing the pond. Only one or two of the lights fixed on the\\ntrees were on, and their clothes showed white against the dark\\nbackground of the trees. They were silent except for an oc-\\ncasional faint sigh.\\n\\nSuddenly Lin Pei-shan broke into a dreamy rendering of the\\nmelancholy popular song Romona, then suddenly she stopped\\nagain.\\n\\nAh-hsuan gave a low, despairing laugh.\\n\\nA carp splashed in the pond.\\n\\nHuei-fang was quite taken by the tune Lin Pei-shan had begun\\nsinging, for it echoed her mood exactly. She thought how lucky\\npeople were who could sing. Singing was another way of speak-\\ning. When you had something you wanted to say, and no way\\nof saying it, and you sang, it was as if you were telling a dear\\nfriend your inmost thoughts. She thought of what Fan Po-wen\\nhad said to her that day, and in her pounding heart she felt\\nhappy and afraid.\\n\\nA pall of silence hung over the pond and over the four people\\non the bank, each of whom was savouring the silence according\\nto his or her own individual mood. Suddenly, the silence was\\nshattered by an uproar which flooded outwards from some dis~-\\ntant storm-centre and swept over the group at the edge of the\\npond: it was the angry voice of Wu Sun-fu raging and storming\\nin the house.\\n\\n“Let\\'s have some lights on here!—It’s enough to give you the\\ncreeps!”\\n\\nWhen the lights went on, his pyjama-clad figure was suddenly\\nvisible in the blaze of light. He was standing on the veranda\\nin front of the drawing-room windows, looking angrily all round\\nas if seeking something to vent his rage on. The bath had washed\\naway his tiredness, but inside him there still seethed a volcano\\nof anger. He caught sight of the four white figures by the pond:\\n“Creeping about there like four ghosts!” he thought, and a sudden\\nfury welled up inside him. Just then the maid Wang Mah hap-\\npened to walk past him carrying a tray of tea-things and head-\\n\\ning for the pond. Immediately seizing this opportunity to let\\nhimself go, he roared at her:\\n\\n“Wang Mah! What are you going out there for?”\\n\\n“Madame and the others are sitting out there by the pond—”\\n\\nWithout waiting for her to finish, he waved her impatiently\\naway, then turned and stalked back into the drawing-room. He\\nsuddenly realized how ridiculous he had just made himself by\\nhis display of bad temper. It was not at all like him to behave\\nlike this, he thought. The glare of the lights in the drawing-\\nroom, however, only served to make him more bad-tempered than\\never, and every bulb seemed to be a little furnace scorching and\\nblistering his skin. To make things worse, there was not a single\\nservant in attendance there. “Where have they all sneaked off\\nto?” he muttered. “Lazy good-for-nothings!” Furious, he bounded\\nout on to the front steps and roared:\\n\\n“Come here, somebody! Blast you!”\\n\\n“Here we are, sir!” came two voices simultaneously from the\\nbottom of the steps. As a matter of fact, the butler, Kao Sheng,\\nand Li Kuei, one of the footmen, had been waiting round the\\ncorner all the time. Wu Sun-fu was taken aback by their sud-\\nden appearance, and just fixed them with a stony stare while\\nhe tried to think of something to say to them. After a moment\\nhe hit on something.\\n\\n“Kao Sheng! Did you ring up Mr. Tu Wei-yueh and ask him\\nto come round as I told you? Why hasn’t he turned up yet?”\\n\\n“Yes, I rang him, sir; but didn’t you say you wanted him over\\nat ten, sir?) Mr. Tu said he was busy but that he could get here\\nby half past—”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” Wu Sun-fu interrupted with a sudden fury.\\n“What do you mean, ‘half past’! Don’t tell me you agreed to\\nhalf past ten?”\\n\\nFrom the direction of the pond came the dreamy strains of Lin\\nPei-shan’s melancholy Romona. The effect on Wu Sun-fu’s anger\\nwas to pour oil on the flames. He stamped his foot, ground his\\nteeth and raved at Kao Sheng, “You blasted idiot! Go and ring\\nhim up again and tell him to come round at once!”\\n\\nHe threw the last few words over his shoulder as he stalked off\\nfuming towards the pond, leaving Kao Sheng and Li Kuei gazing\\nopen-mouthed at each other.\\n\\nThe romantic, melancholy atmosphere among the group by the\\npond suddenly became still and tense: every one of them could\\nsense the approach of the “storm-centre,” and they prepared\\nthemselves for an outburst of gratuitous invective. The nimble-\\nwitted Lin Pei-shan darted away and hid in the trees, where she\\nput her hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh and peeped out,\\nstraining her ears and eyes. Ah-hsuan, who was not over-bright\\non occasions like this, just stood there going through the motions\\nof throwing a recently-acquired and highly-prized throwing-\\nknife. His sister Huei-fang had become suddenly absorbed in\\nwatching the carp which kept rising to the surface of the pond\\nand sending up bubbles. Mrs. Wu, who knew what was com-\\ning, lolled lazily against the back of her chair with a smile on\\nher lips.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu, however, did not flare up at once. He frowned and\\nnarrowed his eyes and looked around as if selecting a victim to\\nget his teeth into. Actually, he really did feel like biting! He\\nfelt that only by “getting his teeth into” someone could he work\\noff the rage that had consumed him ever since his return home.\\nSuch a “bite” would not, of course, be a real one, but it would\\nafford him the same relief as a physical bite. He glared round\\nfor a moment until his eyes fell on the thing in Ah-hsuan’s hand.\\nLike the mousing cat that stalks in silence and keeps her sharp\\nteeth and claws hidden, he asked in a quiet voice:\\n\\n“Ah-hsuan, what’s that you’ve got in your hand?”\\n\\nAh-hsuan was so flustered that, instead of answering, he just\\nheld out his precious throwing-knife for his elder brother’s in-\\nspection.\\n\\n“What the devil\\'s this! Who teaches you to play about with\\nthis sort of thing?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was fierce both in look and voice, but Ah-hsuan’s\\nmanner was so laugh-provoking that the former precariously\\nparted his lips for a second.\\n\\n“Fr—Old Kuan is teaching me to use it,” Ah-hsuan stammered,\\nwithdrawing his throwing-knife and turning to slip away; but\\nWu Sun-fu peremptorily called him to a halt.\\n\\n“Stop! Where do you think you’re going? ‘Throwing-knife’\\nindeed! Get rid of it! Throw it in the pond! A young fellow\\nturned seventeen and still wasting your time on such nonsense\\n\\nas this! The trouble is, you’ve been spoiled down in the country!\\nThe summer holidays are nearly over and you ought to be think-\\ning about getting ready to go back to school!—Go on, throw it in\\nthe pond!”\\n\\nThere was a heavy splash, and Ah-hsuan gazed miserably at\\nthe ripples spreading out above his precious knife.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s irascibility appeared to have abated somewhat,\\nfor his frown disappeared. His hard eyes turned next to his\\nsister Huei-fang. He was weli aware that she had been getting\\nmuch more friendly with Fan Po-wen lately—quite the reverse\\nof what he wished! As he remembered this, another wave of\\nanger swept over him. Nevertheless, he turned away from her\\nand looked at his wife again. She was leaning back in the chair\\nand gazing up bemusedly at the stars in the sky. Just lately she\\nhad seemed to be pining away, and even her eyes, once so spar-\\nkling and eloquent, had now acquired a vacant stare; when, oc-\\ncasionally, they recaptured their old vividness it was only to\\nblaze with anger. Something seemed to be continually gnawing\\nat her heart. And this change had come over her so slowly that\\nWu Sun-fu had never noticed it. Once or twice he had had a\\nvague feeling that all was not well with her, but he had dis-\\nmissed it and immediately forgotten it. Now he seemed to be\\nrealizing it for the first time, and the sudden discovery only in-\\ntensified his exasperation. He immediately abandoned Huei-fang\\nand turned his attention to his wife.\\n\\n“Pei-yao,” he said sharply, “you don’t have to stand on ceremony\\nwith my own brother and sister! If they do anything wrong\\nyou shouldn’t try to shield them! I don’t like all this hole-and-\\ncorner business!”\\n\\nHis wife stared absently at him,.smiling but silent, which only\\nmade him all the more incensed. He snorted savagely and went\\non grimly, “Take Huei-fang for instance. I’m not an old-fashioned\\ndiehard, and when it comes to a question of marriage I’m all\\nfor taking account of the views of the people concerned. But\\nI, too, have a right to be consulted, to see whether it’s a good\\nmatch on both sides or not. It’s no use trying to go behind my\\nback! As a matter of fact, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to\\nthis matter, and somebody has actually approached me about\\narranging a match for her; but you people have to go behind my\\n\\nback and make a mess of it—you’re going to make us look a\\npack of fools!”\\n\\n“Well, this sounds a bit strange to me,” said his wife, feeling\\nshe ought to make some protest. “I don’t understand what you\\nmean about making a mess! If you\\'ve a suitable man in mind,\\nyou might at least let us know who it is!”\\n\\nHe made no answer, but turned abruptly to his sister and said\\nsternly.\\n\\n“Huei-fang, if you’ve got anything to say on the subject, let’s\\nhear it. We must get things straight so that I know what to do.”\\n\\nHuei-fang hung her head till her chin rested on her chest; there\\nwas not a single word from her in reply. Her heart was pound-\\ning wildly. She was afraid of her brother, and she hated him.\\n\\n“All right, then: if you’ve no ideas of your own, I\\'ll arrange\\neverything for you!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu felt the satisfaction of an archer in ambush whose\\narrow has struck down an enemy. With a triumphant laugh he\\nturned and walked away. By the time he reached his study, this\\ncrumb of satisfaction had evaporated, and he again felt the need\\nto “bite” someone—not just to relieve his pent-up rage, as he had\\ndone a moment ago—but to “bite” at his real enemy in any way\\nhe could to compensate himself for his loss. His angry mood\\nhad passed, and it was in a cool, stubborn, relentless frame of\\nmind that he now set himself to the problem of making a desper-\\nate attempt to fight his way out of the net which was closing\\naround him; but almost immediately he was gripped by a dismal\\nfeeling of frustration and despair. His heart now leapt with\\nexcitement, now sank into a torpor of despondency. His spin-\\nning brain seemed no longer to obey his will: he was just re-\\ncalling the momentous decisions he and his partners had made\\nin the managing director’s office of the Yi Chung Trust Company,\\nwhen suddenly he was assailed by a vision of Liu Yu-ying’s seduc-\\ntive smile, her blush as she flashed her eyes at him, and the echo\\nof the murmured temptation: “What shall I call you when you\\ncome to see me...?” And just as he was cheerfully deciding how\\nto dispose his forces for a resounding attack on the eight factories.\\nhe suddenly found himself faced with the prospect of the two\\nthousand-odd workers rising up in a desperate counter-attack....\\n\\nNo matter how he tried, he just could not concentrate; especially\\nwhen the memory of Liu Yu-ying’s inviting smile, her lovely voice\\nand her limpid eyes kept hammering away at his brain and dis-\\ntracting him as he tried to wrestle with his business problems.\\nThis was madness! It was just not like him to lose his head over\\na pretty face!\\n\\n“Bah!” he roared, suddenly leaping to his feet and crashing his\\nfist on the table. “You Jezebel!”\\n\\n“—bel!” echoed the walls of the study. The trees outside the\\nwindow rustled as if they were laughing at his vexation and con-\\nfusion. He collapsed into his chair again and gritted his teeth\\nin an effort to pull himself together and shake off this shameful\\nweakness and decadence that had taken possession of him and\\nrid himself of this feeling of pessimism and despair.\\n\\nAt this juncture the door opened softly and Tu Wei-yueh ap-\\npeared; he stood drawn up to his full height for a moment, then\\nbowed gravely. He turned to close the door behind him, then\\nwalked calmly up to Wu Sun-fu’s desk and looked at him with\\neyes that were placid yet alert.\\n\\nFor fully two or three minutes neither of them spoke.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu reached out and extracted a document from a pile\\non the desk. He bent over as if he were perusing it, then picked\\nup a pen and twirled it in his fingers, so as to give himself time\\nto compose his features and recover his self-possession. After\\na moment he looked up and indicated that Tu Wei-yueh should\\nsit down. His tone was casual and there was a smile on his lips\\nas he began, “I understand you said you were going to be very\\nbusy the first time I rang. Are you free now?”\\n\\n“Quite free,” came his laconic answer; but his twinkling eyes\\nspoke volumes. They seemed to intimate that he was quite aware\\nthat Wu Sun-fu had been just having a fit of temper and depres-\\nsion, and that his present air of studied nonchalance was nothing\\nmore than a pose—it was the slow circling of a hawk before it\\nswoops to the kill.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu lowered his eyes so that the young man should not\\nbe able to read his thoughts. Still twirling the pen between his\\nfingers, he said, “I hear they’re having trouble with the workers\\nin some of the factories in Hongkew. Do you think anything will\\n\\ncome of it? And if anything does happen, do you think it might\\naffect our factories in Chapei?”\\n\\n“Hard to say.”\\n\\nThis answer was one word longer than the first one, and Tu\\nWei-yueh smiled guardedly as he made it. Wu Sun-fu looked\\nswiftly up and roared with what looked like feigned surprise,\\n“What! You sit there and say ‘Hard to say’! I should have\\nthought you would have stuck out your chest and said ‘No fear\\nof that in our factories!’\"—I don’t want to hear you say ‘Hard\\nto say’: What I want to hear is ‘’m sure of it? All right!”\\n\\n“1 could have said that in the first place, but the moment I\\ncame in I smelt a rat—I guessed that you had orders for a wage-\\ncut to give me, so I changed my mind and said ‘Hard to say.’\\nSince you now want me to say ‘I’m sure of it,’ well, all right,\\nT am!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu listened attentively, while his eyes scanned Tu Wei-\\nyueh\\'s imperturbable face. After a short pause he asked, “Have\\nyou made all necessary arrangements?”\\n\\n“Still one or two things to see to—nothing much, though. Of\\ncourse, sir, when the axe falls, there’s bound to be a certain\\namount of resistance; but within a day or two—three days at the\\nmost—everything will be under control. Though it may be—”\\n\\n“What!” interrupted Wu Sun-fu. You mean they might go on\\nstrike? And for three days at that? No, I won\\'t have it! If\\nthey dare start any trouble, I must have it settled the same day!\\nD\\'you hear? The same day!—And what were you saying about\\n‘It may be’? It may be that the strike will last more than three\\ndays, I suppose!”\\n\\nHis voice was harsh as he said this, though his expression re-\\nmained calm and unruffled.\\n\\n“It may be,” replied Tu Wei-yueh with a mocking smile, “that\\na single spark of trouble in our factory would set off a general\\nstrike involving every silk filature in Shanghai!”\\n\\nThis was the fateful ladle of oil, so to speak, and the smoulder-\\ning fires of Wu Sun-fu’s anger, which he had been managing te\\ncontrol all this time, suddenly burst into flame. He flung down\\nhis pen and with blazing eyes raved at Tu Wei-yueh:\\n\\n“I don’t give a damn whether it means a general strike or not!\\nIf there’s the slightest hint of trouble in my factory, Pll have\\nit settled the same day without any ifs or buts!”\\n\\n“In that case you\\'ll have to resort to force—”\\n\\n“Quite! That’s just what I will do!”\\n\\n“All right: in that case, sir, I must ask permission to resign!”\\n\\nAs he said this, Tu Wei-yueh stood up and fixed Wu Sun-fu\\nwith a hard, fearless stare. A brief silence. Wu Sun-fu’s ex~\\npression changed gradually from amazement to cool indifference.\\nFinally, he asked impatiently, “So you don’t like the idea of using\\nforce, eh? Afraid?”\\n\\n“Not a bit of it! Now, honestly, Mr. Wu: have I ever shown\\nany signs of being afraid? I don’t mind telling you, I think I’ve\\nput more than my share of hard work into the factory in the\\npast month, and I refuse to be a party to undoing all that I’ve\\nachieved through a salid month’s planning and effort! Still, you’re\\nthe boss, and it’s up to you to do what you think best. All I ask\\nis that you accept my immediate resignation! And may I re-\\npeat that I’m not in the least afraid!”\\n\\nHe squared his shoulders proudly and riveted his keen eyes on\\nWu Sun-fu’s face.\\n\\n“I’m well aware that you’ve been making all these plans and\\narrangements: I now intend to put them to the test and see\\nif they work!”\\n\\n“All right, Mr. Wu; since you know all about it, let me tell you\\none thing more. You say I must use force and settle any trouble\\nthe same day. Nothing simpler: police, detectives, security guards\\n—they’re all ready and at our disposal. But if we settle the\\ntrouble today, and it breaks out again in ten days or a couple\\nof weeks’ time, I don’t think you’d be at all happy about it. Be-\\nsides, I just couldn’t bring myself to betray your trust in me by\\ndoing as you say—in fact, my present position of trust means a\\ngreat deal to me.”\\n\\nFor a while Wu Sun-fu could think of nothing to say. He\\npicked up his pen again, twirled it between his fingers, and sat\\nstaring at Tu Wei-yueh’s face for quite a while. Tu Wei-yueh,\\nhis face betraying not the faintest trace of emotion, was quite\\ncontent to let him look, though he was secretly rather surprised\\nat Wu Sun-fu’s unaccustomed hesitation.\\n\\nAfter some deliberation, Wu Sun-fu asked at length, “Well,\\nwhat do you think we should do?”\\n\\n“Well, I’m in favour of using a little force myself—but not till\\nthe very end! Our workers aren’t all cast in the same mould:\\nsome of them are a bad influence—Communists, most likely—and\\nsome of the more stupid of the workers just tag along with them;\\nput the majority are timid and don’t want to get into trouble.\\nThe reason I ask for three days to finish the job is because three\\ndays of unrest will give me an excellent opportunity of finding\\nout for sure just who these suspected Communists are, and then\\nnetting them all at one fell swoop! That’s where the use of a\\nlittle force comes in! After that, I think we can be sure of peace\\nand quiet for six months at least. This is what I’ve been work-\\ning so hard for for the last month!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh had spoken calmly and self-confidently, a smile\\non his lips; Wu Sun-fu had listened with concentrated attention,\\nbut now he suddenly rolled his eyes upwards and laughed\\ngrimly, then jumped up and roared excitedly:\\n\\n“You may be very clever, Wei-yueh, but there are still certain\\nthings that you don’t understand. You can’t make a clean sweep\\nof them just like that! They\\'re like moth in a fur in the rainy\\nseason—they just keep appearing one after the other! You catch\\nthem all today, but tomorrow there’s another lot there! All you\\ncan do is to wait until the rainy season is over. Unfortunately,\\nwe\\'re just coming into a ‘rainy season’ now, and it’s going to be\\na long, long time—nobody knows just how long—before it’s over!\\n—Well, that’s that: your little plan will have to keep for the time\\nbeing. We just can’t afford that kind of patience as things are\\nat present!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh bowed but said nothing. He was thinking that\\nwith this reverse his fate was surely sealed. If he did not re-\\nsign, his “régime” in the factory was doomed, and Chien Pao-\\nsheng and his clique would step into his shoes. Suddenly, Wu\\nSun-fu flew into a rage again: his face dark with anger, he\\nbarked out his orders:\\n\\n“T don’t care whether there’s a strike or not, or whether there’s\\na general strike for that matter: my mind’s made up! Starting\\nnext month, there’s going to be a twenty-per-cent wage-cut! If\\nthe price of silk goes up to over nine hundred taels a picul again,\\n\\nI may consider a wage-increase—very well, you can go now! And\\nI won’t allow you to resign!”\\n\\n“In that case, Mr. Wu, you must give me three days to do the\\njob!”\\n\\n“Out of the question!’ Wu Sun-fu bellowed. “I can’t even give\\nyou one day!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh’s face twitched and his eyes glinted dangerously.\\nQuite unexpectedly, Wu Sun-fu’s manner suddenly changed again;\\nhe gestured impatiently and said, “Idiot! Thinking you can tie\\nme down! Wait until they’re gone on strike first, and then we\\'ll\\nsee about it.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled and bowed again, but said nothing. He\\ncould see quite clearly that Wu Sun-fu was not his usual self—\\nhe seemed slightly abnormal, slightly flustered. And then he re-\\nmembered that he himself was probably heading for disaster,\\nBut he was tough, and there was plenty of fight left in him yet.\\nXI\\n\\nT HERE had been no lightning yet, only an occasional rumble of\\nthunder like the sound of a heavily-laden lorry passing by. Over-\\nhead hung a canopy of grey, unbroken but for a rift in the west-\\nern sky, where a minute patch of purple cloud showed through.\\nBehind this purple cloud a disconcerted sun was dropping down\\ntowards the horizon.\\n\\nIn the workshop of the Yu Hua Silk Filature all the lights\\nwere already on. Spindles and fingers moved so quickly that\\nthe workshop seemed to be one great nervously-pulsating\\nmachine. The electric lights showed sallow-faced through the\\ndense clouds of steam, as if on the verge of fainting away. The\\nwomen, their ears dulled by the eternal noise of the machines,\\ncould not hear the rumbles of thunder from the sky outside, but\\nthey could still hear the babble of their own excited voices; here,\\ntoo, was an ominous growl of thunder, but of a different kind.\\nTheir faces were flushed, and their tongues were as busy as their\\nhands. The foremen and forewomen seemed to be pretending\\nto be deaf—though not pretending to be dumb—and when they\\noccasionally muttered something a chorus of jeers burst from\\nthe women.\\n\\nAll of a sudden the hooter blared through the factory, and there\\nwas a commotion in the workshop. As the sound of the filatures\\ngradually died down the voices seemed to get louder. The women\\njostled out of the workshop with their empty lunch-baskets on\\ntheir arms, milled around at the gate waiting to be searched,\\nand then swarmed out into the roadway. It was only then that\\nthey realized that it was thundering and that an overcast sky\\nawaited them with its promise of a storm.\\n\\nAll was silent now in the factory, and the lights in the work-\\nshop were off, which made those that streamed from the windows\\n\\nof the offices seem all the brighter. Tu Wei-yueh was sitting in\\nhis office with bent head. The 32-watt bulb above him threw\\na pale light on his face, which was as expressionless as that of a\\nstatue. Suddenly the door opened, and Mo Kan-cheng’s flustered\\nface appeared round the edge of the door. He came in and said\\nin a low voice:\\n\\n“Look here, Wei-yueh, Mr. Wu\\'s just rung up to ask whether\\nthe notice about the wage-cut’s been put up yet. I told him\\nyou were going to do it tomorrow, and he didn’t sound at all\\npleased about it! What are you going to do about it? The\\nwomen were kicking up a row when they Knocked off just now\\n—they must have got wind of it the same as they did last time—”\\n\\n“So what?” said Tu Wei-yueh with a smile. “They’ve got to\\nknow sooner or later!” He glanced at Mo Kan-cheng, then looked\\nout of the window.\\n\\n“If Mr. Wu cuts up rough about it tomorrow, don’t blame me!”\\n\\n“Of course not!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh was becoming impatient. Mo Kan-cheng fixed\\nhis beady eyes on Tu Wei-yueh’s face for a moment, then hunched\\nup his shoulders; pulling a face as much as to say, “I should\\nworry!” he turned on his heel and went out, slamming the door\\nbehind him.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled unconcernedly, but he could not go on\\nsitting there as motionless as a statue; he fished out his watch\\nand glanced at it, looked out of the window once more, then\\nopened the door and went out. He was just walking away when\\nhis sharp eyes caught sight of two figures hurrying through the\\ngloom. They went straight into his office, and he retraced his\\nSteps. Just as he reached the doorway someone came up behind\\nhim, tapped him on the shoulder, and giggled.\\n\\n“Now, Ah Chen!” he whispered over his shoulder. “No sky-\\nlarking. We\\'re on our best behaviour tonight!”\\n\\nHe went into his office, and she followed behind him.\\n\\nThe two men waiting in the room were Kuei Chang-lin and\\nPockmarked Li. The moment they saw Tu Wei-yueh, they both\\nuttered an excited “Ah!” and tried to get a word in first; but Tu\\nWei-yueh checked them with a look and waved the two of them\\nand Ah Chen to a bench in the corner of the room, while he\\nhimself went and stood with his back to the window. The elec-\\n\\ntric light seemed suddenly dimmer, and the atmosphere in the\\nroom was tense. Outside, thunder rolled slowly across the sky.\\nA little colour had returned to Tu Wei-yueh’s pale face. He\\nglanced at his three companions.\\n\\n“Im! Where’s Yao Chin-feng got to?”\\n\\n“We didn’t bring her along in case we attracted too much at-\\ntention,’ Ah Chen put in hastily. “Tf you\\'ve got a job for her,\\nI can easily pass it on to her later.” As she spoke, she threw\\nTu Wei-yueh a coquettish glance. He nodded briefly, but said\\nnothing; nor did he return her amorous glance. His expression\\nsuddenly became grim and he raised his voice slightly.\\n\\n“From now on we must all put our backs into it and work to-\\ngether! There’s to be no more chasing after girls, no more petty\\njealousies, and no more squabbling among ourselves!”\\n\\nAh Chen pulled a face and hemmed. Pretending not to have\\nnoticed this, Tu Wei-yueh went on:\\n\\n“Wang Chin-chen is unable to come, because I\\'ve sent her off\\non something else; so there will be just the four of us in on this\\ndiscussion. Well, a short while ago, Mr. Wu rang up to see why\\nI hadn’t put the notice up yet. He’s getting pretty het up about\\nit and he didn’t sound at all pleased. I promised I’d announce\\nthe wage-cut tomorrow for sure. Mr. Wu understands, of course,\\nthat we need a little time to finish making all our arrangements\\nbefore the cut is announced. We shouldn’t have any trouble\\ncoming to terms with him all right, but I can see our rivals try-\\ning to get round him and cutting the ground from under our feet;\\nso I think we must use seventy per cent of our strength against\\nthem and thirty per cent of it against the women! Chang-lin, do\\nyou think we\\'ll have trouble when the notice goes up tomorrow?”\\n\\n“No doubt about it! Chien Pao-sheng and his lot are just spoil-\\ning for a fight and they’ll make the most of this to try and put\\npaid to us! Dirty rats!”\\n\\n“Mr, Tu!” put in Pockmarked Li quickly when he saw that\\nKuei Chang-lin had no suggestions for definite action. ‘We\\'ve\\nonly got to get my lads in, and then if there’s any trouble to-\\nmorrow we won\\'t stand any nonsense—we’ll just run ’em down\\nto the police station and see how they like that! If we’re nippy\\nabout it we can get it over before Chien Pao-sheng and them\\nhave a chance to do the dirty on us!”\\n\\nHighly pleased with himself, he held out his great Paws, spat\\ninto them, rubbed them together, clenched them into fists, placed\\nthem on his knees, and adopted an aggressive attitude. Tu Wei-\\nyueh paid no attention to all this; he just smiled faintly and\\nturned again to Ah Chen.\\n\\n“Ah Chen! Why don’t you say something? What were things\\nlike in the workshop when you were there just now? How did\\nthe women react to the rumour we put out about the wage-cut?\\nWhat did Hsueh Pao-chu and that girl Chou Erh-chieh have to\\nsay about it? Well, let’s hear it! Don’t keep us waiting!”\\n\\n“I don\\'t know!” Ah Chen snapped, pursing her lips and turn-\\ning her face away to look at the wall. “You’d better have Yao\\nChin-feng in and ask her about it!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh’s face suddenly darkened. Kuei Chang-lin and\\nPockmarked Li were amused and began making faces at Ah Chen\\nto tease her. His eyes blazing, Tu Wei-yueh stamped his foot\\nand was just going to let himself go, when Ah Chen gave in and\\nsaid crossly:\\n\\n“What did they say? They said, ‘Down with Chamber-pot Tu!’—\\nmeaning you! What did Hsueh Pao-chu and Chou Erh-chieh say?\\nThey said, ‘Chamber-pot Tu is playing a dirty trick on us!’ and\\na lot of other nice things, but I can’t remember them all now—\\nyou’ve got nothing to laugh about, Chang-lin! They want to\\nget rid of you, too!”\\n\\nOutside the windows the first flash of lightning lit up the sky.\\nA few seconds later a rumble of thunder was heard in the dis-\\ntance. Suddenly, a violent gust of wind swept into the room, and\\nthe four of them gave a shiver.\\n\\nA roar of indignation leapt to Pockmarked Li’s lips, but Tu\\nWei-yueh silenced him with a wave of the hand and said im-\\nperturbably:\\n\\n“We\\'ve got solid proof that Chien Pao-sheng and his lot are\\ntrying to put a spoke in our wheel. What are we going to do\\nabout it? Last night I told Mr. Wu that I wanted to resign, but\\nhe wouldn’t hear of it for a moment. So all I can do is carry\\non. Strictly speaking, disputes between different groups in the\\ntrade union are none of my business; but I believe in seeing fair\\nplay! Frankly, I think Kuei Chang-lin and his supporters are\\n\\nbeing treated really badly and that Chien Pao-sheng’s being too\\nhigh-handed. Don’t you agree with me, Li?”\\n\\n“You\\'re dead right! Down with Chien Pao-sheng!” chorused\\nPockmarked Li and Kuei Chang-lin, while Ah Chen giggled with\\nher hand over her mouth. Tu Wei-yueh squared his shoulders,\\ntook a deep breath, and went on:\\n\\n“It’s not that we want to make things difficult for Mr. Wu, but\\nthe fact remains that Chien Pao-sheng and his crew are work-\\ning for their own ends under the pretence of helping the workers,\\nand making use of them to establish their own power. We shan’t\\nhave a day’s peace all the time they remain here. We\\'re all suf-\\nfering merely to serve their selfish ends, which is grossly unfair!\\nTomorrow they’ll be trying to set the women against us: very\\nwell, we’ll take them on! Once we\\'ve got Chien Pao-sheng and\\nhis gang out of the factory, we can then deal with the strike, if\\nthere is one. In three days it\\'ll all be over—three days at the\\noutside!”\\n\\n“Ah, but in the workshop today they got round the women so\\nwell that a lot of them are on their side now,” said Ah Chen,\\npursing her lips. Kuei Chang-lin immediately knit his brows\\nin a worried frown. He had never had much influence with the\\nworkwomen, and the little footing he had recently acquired among\\nthem was due entirely to Tu Wei-yueh’s efforts. Tu Wei-yueh’s\\nshrewd eyes saw through him at a glance; he snorted contemp-\\ntuously and despised him for being such a broken reed. He re-\\nturned his gaze to the uncouth Pockmarked Li, with his glaring\\neyes and his tightly-clenched fists, the undisguised and distinc-\\ntive badges of his kind, indicating that he was ready to fight for\\nwhoever would pay him. Tu Wei-yueh was satisfied with this\\nman. He took a step forward, so that he was standing right\\nunder the light, and said to Ah Chen:\\n\\n“So the women believe what Chien Pao-sheng tells them, eh?\\nNow, Ah Chen! Don’t tell me that you with your smooth tongue\\ncan’t beat Hsueh Pao-chu! And can’t Yao Chin-feng go one bet-\\nter than Chou Erh-chieh? If those two can pull the wool over\\nthe women’s eyes, why can’t you two do it as well? If the work-\\nwomen don’t yet realize that Chou Erh-chieh is one of Chien Pao-\\nsheng’s cat’s-paws, why should you imagine that they know you’re\\non our side? It’s not as if you\\'ve got the word ‘spy’ branded\\n\\non your forehead! Surely you can easily unmask Chou Erh-chieh\\nand let them see her for what she is? Now off you go, Ah Chen,\\nand tell Yao Chin-feng what’s got to be done. Get around among\\nthe women and stir them up against Chien Pao-sheng, Hsueh\\nPao-chu, and Chou Erh-chieh. Don’t worry about them going\\non strike tomorrow! Now look snappy! Later on I\\'ll get some\\nothers to back you up. You\\'ll get a first-class ‘merit’ for it!”\\n\\n“Who do you think cares a straw for your ‘merits’? I’m doing\\nmy job and I\\'ll be satisfied if everybody plays fair!”\\n\\nAh Chen stood up, and as she went out she threw Tu Wei-yueh\\na deliberately disdainful look. Tu Wei-yueh stood with his head\\non one side for a moment, thinking; then he stepped up to Pock-\\nmarked Li, clapped him on the back, and asked in an undertone,\\n“Look here, old man! Can you round up twenty of your lads for\\ntonight?”\\n\\n“You bet!” said Pockmarked Li, leaping to his feet, his face\\nglowing with joy and his saliva generously splashing Tu Wei-\\nyueh’s face. “Twenty, you say? Easy get you fifty if you like!”\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled.\\n\\n“Excellent! Though twenty’ll do for tonight. I want them to\\nwalk around the women’s huts—get it? Just walk around and\\nnot get involved in any quarrels. There are just two girls I\\nwant shadowed—Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin—Chang Ah-\\nhsin’s the girl with a flat face and big breasts; know the one I\\nmean? And I\\'ll want your twenty chaps back here at the fac-\\ntory tomorrow morning. What’s the work? Let you know in the\\nmorning. And now go round to Mr. Mo and take a hundred\\ndollars. All right, that’s all.”\\n\\nOnly Tu Wei-yueh and Kuei Chang-lin were left in the room\\nnow, and for a while neither of them spoke. The thunder rever-\\nberating across the sky was louder now, but more leisurely, like\\nthe subdued rumble of a night-soil cart on its early-morning\\nrounds. There was a flash of lightning every two or three\\nminutes, but it was no more than a brief flicker. The wind was\\nrising now, and the lights hanging from the ceiling were swing-\\ning in the breeze. Outside the windows it was pitch dark. Tu\\nWei-yueh glanced at his watch: it was just on half past seven.\\n\\n“Mr. Tu, if we have a strike and it drags on a long time, I\\nthink we\\'ll probably be the losers,” Kuei Chang-lin said slowly\\n\\nand quietly, and with a tone of ill-concealed pessimism in his\\nvoice. “Those three new men in the general office—Tseng, Ma,\\nand that distant nephew of Mr. Wu\\'s—they’re all running you\\ndown behind your back. Seems to me they’re well in with Chien\\nPao-sheng.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh shrugged and smiled. He was afraid of nothing.\\nNarrowing one of his beady eyes, Kuei Chang-lin went on in a\\ndismal voice, “You forgot to warn Pockmarked Li not to let on\\nin front of Ah Hsiang. That was a mistake. I\\'ve always\\nsuspected that this fellow Ah Hsiang is spying on us for Chien\\nPao-sheng. Though Pockmarked Li is very thick with him.”\\n\\n“Chang-lin, you’re too timid ever to make a go of anything\\nbig! We\\'re hard pressed for helpers just now, and so we\\'ll just\\nhave to take certain chances. Don’t worry about Ah Hsiang: I\\ncan take care of him all right! The real difficulty lies with the\\nwomen. I’ve given the Old Man my word that I’ end the strike\\nwithin three days if it comes, and that I\\'ll make a clean sweep\\nof all the trouble-makers at the same time, so that there won\\'t be\\nany more strikes for the next six months. So we\\'ll let them go\\non strike tomorrow—anyway, we couldn’t stop them even if we\\nwanted to—but I\\'ve decided that we shouldn’t use force tomorrow.\\nWe\\'ll give them their heads for a couple of days, so that they\\'ll\\nhave plenty of time to finish off Chien Pao-sheng and his lot, and\\nthen we\\'ll settle their hash in no uncertain manner! So you see,\\nChang-lin, you\\'ll have to put your best foot forward and work the\\nmajority of the women round on to your side.”\\n\\n“Shall I tell my people to pretend they’re against the wage-\\ncut, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, of course. We\\'ll settle Ho Hsiu-mei and her lot first, and\\nthen we\\'ll be able to kid the women into going back to work;\\nafter that we can talk terms with them. I’m perfectly certain\\nHo Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin are the trouble-makers, but there\\nmust be others besides, and it’s up to us to find out who they are.\\nI’m giving you the job of finding out, Chang-lin, and I want you\\nto report back to me tomorrow.”\\n\\nAs he said this, Tu Wei-yueh glanced at his watch again, then\\ndismissed Kuei Chang-lin and left the office himself.\\n\\nFlashes of lightning lit up the dark, cloudy sky, whose uniform\\nleaden gloom had by now broken up into patches of black and\\n\\ngrey. Great, solid banks of cloud, anvil-topped, towered up like\\na range of mountains, black at the bases and grey at the sum-\\nmits. The thunder was now even louder than before. Tu Wei-\\nyueh cut across an open space piled high with wooden boxes\\nand came to a small building. This was the office where Wu\\nSun-fu interviewed his office staff when visiting the factory. It\\nwas normally unoccupied, but just now glimmers of light showed\\nthrough the cracks of the tightly-closed slatted shutters. When\\nTu Wei-yueh pushed the door open and went in, the two people\\nin the room stood up. He smiled and signed to them to sit down\\nagain and asked one of them, who was Wang Chin-chen, fore-\\nwoman No, 2:\\n\\n“Have you told her yet?”\\n\\n“No, we\\'ve only just this minute arrived, and I thought you’d\\nlike to speak to her yourself, Mr. Tu,” replied Wang Chin-chen\\nmysteriously. She winked at Tu Wei-yueh and stood up as if to\\ngo, but Tu Wei-yueh waved her back to her seat, at the same time\\nturning to look at the young factory girl who sat there very\\nill at ease. She was a girl of about twenty with bobbed hair\\nand of middling height. Her skin was dark, but she had a lovely\\ncomplexion and lively, sparkling eyes. She blushed hotly under\\nTu Wei-yueh’s compelling gaze.\\n\\nWhen he had stared at her for a while he smiled and said\\ngently, “Chu Kuei-ying, you’ve been here for almost two years.\\nYou’re very good at your work and you\\'re well-behaved. I’ve\\nmentioned your name to the proprietor, and we\\'re thinking of\\nmaking you a forewoman. This will be a special promotion in\\nyour case, as I expect you\\'ll appreciate.”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying did not reply, but sat with crimson cheeks and\\ndowncast eyes. Her heart was pounding and her mind was in\\na whirl, for when Wang Chin-chen had gone to fetch her she\\nhad only told her that she was wanted in the office, and she had\\nsupposed that she was going to be on the carpet for expressing\\nher opposition to the wage-cut before she knocked off work,\\nand that some informer must have reported her. Now it turned\\nout that they wanted to promote her, and she did not know what\\nto think. Besides, this man in charge of the factory, Tu Wei-\\nyueh, had once been in the habit of pestering her with his atten-\\ntions at every opportunity, so perhaps he was just trying to get\\n\\nround her by doing this. When this thought struck her, she felt\\nmore tongue-tied than ever. Now Wang Chin-chen put in a word\\nto help persuade her.\\n\\n“Mr. Wu is really being very fair and Mr. Tu is trying to\\nhelp you, too, but they wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t that you deserve\\nit, Kuei-ying!”\\n\\n“Wang Chin-chen’s right, you know,” said Tu Wei-yueh in the\\nsame gentle voice, while his keen eyes looked her up and down.\\n“Mr. Wu’s a fair man and he’s very considerate. He often says\\nthat if it had not been for the drop in silk prices, which meant\\nthat he would make a loss, he would gladly have agreed to a\\ncost-of-living allowance last time. And if it were not for the\\nfact that prices have recently dropped even lower, the idea of\\na wage-cut would never have entered his head! Although he’s\\nmaking a loss, Mr. Wu still sees to it that those who work hard\\nand behave themselves are fairly treated. That’s why you\\'re\\ngetting special promotion!”\\n\\nAlthough Chu Kuei-ying still hung her head, she was con-\\nscious of his eye on her. When she had finally made up her\\nmind, she looked up, her face now white, and said quietly but\\nfirmly:\\n\\n“Thank you very much, Mr. Tu, but this sort of thing is not\\nfor me!”\\n\\nJust then there was a flash of lightning and a sudden crash\\nof thunder right overhead which seemed to shake the room.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh winced, but whether because of the sudden noise,\\nor whether because of her reply, it was not clear. Knitting his\\nbrows, he tipped Wang Chin-chen a wink. She nodded and\\npulled a face, then slipped quietly out. Chu Kuei-ying immedi-\\nately stood up, but Tu Wei-yueh stopped her.\\n\\n“Mr. Tu! What do you want me for now?”\\n\\n“What\\'s the hurry? I’ve got something more to tell you yet—”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying blushed furiously. She was now quite certain\\nthat he was out for a spot of philandering. She had not dis-\\nliked him before when he had been a junior clerk in the factory,\\nbut ever since his promotion to his present position as the most\\npowerful man in the office she had felt as if a high mountain\\nhad sprung up between them, and had been very ill at ease at\\n\\nhaving to talk with him more than she could help. And now he\\nhad tricked her into coming here, and was refusing to let her go!\\n\\n“I don’t want to hear it!” she said, fixing him with a stare\\nand standing her ground. “You can have me into the office\\ntomorrow and tell me then!”\\n\\n“You needn’t be afraid,” he said with a sardonic smile. “I\\nalways behave myself with women: I don’t flirt with them and\\nI don’t take advantage of them! All I wanted was to find out\\nwhy you don’t want to be promoted to forewoman. We\\'re not\\nexpecting a lot of you—all we want you to do is to help us with\\nsomething. All you’ve got to do is to tell me which of the girls\\nhave anything to do with those dubious characters, the Com-\\nmunists. Don’t worry, I won’t let on that you told me. Why,\\nI’ve even sent Wang Chin-chen away!”\\n\\nHe said this in the same gentle undertone, but it came as a\\ngreat shock to Chu Kuei-ying, and the colour drained from her\\ncheeks. This was something even worse than the philandering\\nwhich she had expected. She simply loathed him now.\\n\\n“I don’t know what you\\'re talking about!” she said, dashing\\npast him and straight out through the door. She heard Wang\\nChin-chen’s voice calling after her, and then a shout from Tu\\nWei-yueh as if he was telling Wang Chin-chen to be quiet. With\\nnever a look behind her, Chu Kuei-ying raced round the work-\\nshop and made for the main gate.\\n\\nAbout fifteen yards from the gate was the gloomy row of sheds\\nwhere the cocoons were stored. Just as Chu Kuei-ying was run-\\nning past this place, a flash of lightning suddenly lit up every-\\nwhere as bright as day. There was a crash of thunder overhead,\\nand as the thunder broke someone sprang out on her and threw\\nhis arms round her in a tight embrace. It all happened so sud-\\ndenly that the strength went out of her limbs. Her heart pounded\\nwildly and she was too stunned to cry out until the man had\\nalready dragged her several paces away with him.\\n\\n“Help! You—” she shouted as she began to struggle with\\nhim, thinking it was Tu Wei-yueh. But the noise of the thunder\\nas it rumbled across the sky drowned her voice. Suddenly, another\\nflash of lightning flooded the scene with a glare of white light,\\nand she was able to see that it was not Tu Wei-yueh at all! At\\n\\nthis juncture, someone else, a hurricane-lamp in his hand, came\\nrunning towards them, shouting:\\n\\n“What do you think you’re on?”\\n\\nIt was Tu Wei-yueh’s voice. Chu Kuei-ying’s attacker now let\\ngo of her and turned to slip away, but Tu Wei-yueh grabbed him\\nwith one hand and lifted the light to his face with the other: it\\nwas Tseng Chia-chu. Tu Wei-yueh scowled and fixed him with a\\ncontemptuous stare. A long peal of thunder came echoing across\\nthe sky. Tu Wei-yueh released Tseng Chia-chu and turned to look\\nat Chu Kuei-ying, a cynical smile on his lips.\\n\\n“If you don’t want to help me that’s all right by me,” he said,\\nhis tone as polite as ever. “There’s no need to go running away\\nlike this. How do you imagine you can get past the watchman at\\nthe main gate if you’re on your own? You\\'d better go out with\\nWang Chin-chen.”\\n\\nHe then called Wang Chin-chen over to escort her, and went\\nback the way he had come.\\n\\n*\\n\\nWhen Chu Kuei-ying reached her “home,” it had already started\\nraining, and heavy, scattered drops were pattering against the\\nbamboo door. The little thatched hut was in darkness except\\nfor a glimmer of light from a neighbour’s lamp filtering through\\na crack in the clay-plastered party-wall. When she had recov-\\nered her breath, she became aware that groans were coming\\nfrom the rickety bamboo bed—her mother.\\n\\n“What\\'s the matter, Mum? Are you ill or something?”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying went across to her mother and laid her hand\\non the old lady’s much-wrinkled forehead. For a moment the old\\nlady seemed glad to see her daughter, then suddenly she burst\\ninto tears. Chu Kuei-ying took no notice, for her mother often\\ncried like this. She heaved a sigh and her thoughts returned\\nto the nightmarish: events of that evening and the rumour of\\nan impending twenty per cent wage-cut. Her heart was ablaze\\nwith anxiety and hatred. After a moment her mother cried out\\nin a voice choked with sobs:\\n\\n“Kuei-ying, these days... there’s only one way out for poor\\npeople like us...and that’s to die!”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying stared dazedly at her mother for a moment, but\\nsaid nothing. The only way out is to die? Chu Kuei-ying realized\\n\\nfull well that they were on the verge of destitution, but she was\\na young girl of nineteen, toughened by a life of Poverty and\\nhardship, and she had no intention of just giving up like that and\\ndying—as a matter of fact, she believed that she had a right to\\na decent life, like anyone else. She patted her mother’s chest\\nand asked in a soothing voice, “What’s the matter, Mum?\\nBusiness bad today?”\\n\\n“Business bad? Ah! You know very well it’s always the same,\\nKuei-ying. Every day business is so bad it makes me cry. But\\ntoday... just look at my basket over there!”\\n\\nThe old lady suddenly boiled over: she hauled herself painfully\\nup and sat there, her lips pressed together, fuming with\\nindignation.\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying picked up out of the corner the wicker basket\\nfrom which her mother peddled peanuts. She found that the\\nrim had been torn away, so that it was now useless, and that it\\nwas quite empty. She tossed it aside and puffed out her cheeks\\nwith annoyance.\\n\\n“I suppose you’ve been quarrelling with somebody, eh, Mum?”\\n\\n“Quarrelling? As if I would! It was some bullying devil —\\nblast him!~—came and set on me for no reason at all! He snatched\\nmy basket, took my peanuts and threatened to run me in!”\\n\\n“But what should anybody want to do a thing like that for?”\\n\\n“He said I was—oh, I can’t remember what it was now!—Have\\na look at them papers there! He said I’m breaking the law\\nhaving them!”\\n\\nShe had stopped crying now, and the more she spoke the more\\nexcited she became. She groped on the table for a match and\\nlit an oil lamp. Chu Kuei-ying looked in the bottom of the basket\\nand saw a few small sheets of paper with something printed on\\nthem in red. It was the paper her mother used for wrapping\\nup her peanuts. She remembered that Sze Hsi-tse, the rag-and-\\nbone boy from next door, had picked up a thick wad of these\\nsheets of paper somewhere in the streets a couple of weeks before,\\nand that her mother had given him some peanuts in exchange\\nfor some of it for wrapping-paper. How could she be breaking\\nthe law by using it? She picked up a sheet and looked at it\\nclosely; three of the signs on it looked rather familiar. She\\nthought for a moment and then she remembered: they stood for\\n\\n“Communist Party.” She had often seen these words scrawled\\non the walls beside the factory gate and on telegraph poles by\\nthe roadside, and her brother Little San-tse had told her what\\nthey stood for. And then this was what Tu Wei-yueh had asked\\nher about when he had sent for her a short while ago.\\n\\n“And I’m not the only one who uses that sort of paper,” the old\\nlady complained indignantly, her lips trembling as she spoke.\\n“Old Pah the cooked-beef man uses it, too. And then—”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying was shrewd enough to guess that it was a case\\nof some tramp roving the streets looking for a free meal anc\\nfinding a pretext to do himself a good turn. She tossed the sheets\\nof paper aside and fell silent for a moment, then picked up the\\nbasket again to see whether it could be mended and used again.\\nSuddenly she looked worried; she let the basket fall to the mud\\nfloor and put her head on one side to listen.\\n\\nA hubbub of argument and angry words was coming from the\\nneighbours in the next hut—girls working in the same factory\\nas Chu Kuei-ying. The hiss of the rain on the bamboo doors was\\nlouder and more insistent than ever and overhead the rumble of\\nthunder still rolled across the sky, but the sound of voices which\\nrose from the huts was even flercer than the angry roar of the\\nstorm. Doors groaned on their hinges as people went in and\\nout of the huts, and the whole settlement of workers from the\\nsilk factory was a hive of activity. While one storm raged\\noverhead, another kind of storm was about to break in this little\\nshanty-town!\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying was becoming restless, and she had just sprung\\nto her feet to go out when the bamboo door of her own hut\\ncreaked open and in burst a skinny youngster in a blue jacket.\\nswearing at the top of his voice:\\n\\n“That perishing old swine of a boss we\\'ve got! He’s got plenty\\nof money to throw around on whores and gambling and building\\nposh houses! But when it comes to paying out wages and keep-\\ning his factory going, he makes out he’s broke! Rotten old\\nbastard!”\\n\\nThis was Chu Kuei-ying’s brother Little San-tse, who worked\\njn a match factory. Too excited to pay any attention to his\\nmother and sister asking him what it was all about, he raved\\nangrily on:\\n\\n“We used to get sixty cents a day; in the spring it was cut down\\nto fifty cents; and now today, if you please, that old perisher\\nChou Chung-wei sticks up a notice about ‘high costs’ or some\\nsuch nonsense, and saying he’s losing a lot of money so he’s got\\nto cut us down to forty cents!”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Little San-tse picked up the box of matches on\\nthe table and slapped his hand against it.\\n\\n“Two coppers a box he gets for these, and he tells us he’s losing\\nmoney! —Give me eight coppers, Kuei-ying: I want to get some\\nscones for my supper. The blokes in the factory are having\\na meeting tonight, and I’m going along with Chin Ho-shang from\\nnext door. If that old swine Chou’s going to cut our wages down,\\nwe\\'re bloody well going on strike!”\\n\\nWhen the old lady realized that they were going to have\\nanother wage-cut at the factory where her son worked, she felt\\ndisaster had finally overtaken them. By the time the full re-\\nalization of it had come home to her, Little San-tse had gone.\\nAfter a moment Chu Kuei-ying followed him out. The pelting\\nrain felt cool and pleasant to her face. She was seething with\\nrage and indignation and her face was so hot that it seemed\\nas if the raindrops would dry as soon as they touched it.\\n\\nOutside the bamboo door the ground was strewn with rubbish\\nwashed down by the heavy rain. A flash of lightning Hit up the\\nhuddle of huts, and in the brilliant white glare she could see a\\nnumber of people hurrying through the downpour. When the\\nflash had passed the darkness seemed blacker than ever. Chu\\nKuei-ying’s destination was the east end of the slum, about fif-\\nteen yards away. She was going to the “home” of Chang Ah-hsin,\\none of the girls she worked with, to tell her how Tu Wei-yueh\\nhad sent for her and tried to pump her about the people who\\nwere mixed up with the Communists. At this moment her\\nthoughts were moving faster than her feet. She had almost\\nreached Chang Ah-hsin’s hut, when in the darkness she suddenly\\nfelt somebody’s arms round her.\\n\\n“Kuei-ying!” cried a voice in her ear, and as she recognized\\nit Chu Kuei-ying’s heart began to beat less violently. It was\\nChin Hsiao-mei, one of the girls who worked in the same factory.\\nShe was only thirteen, but was much older in the head. She was\\nthe younger sister of Chin Ho-shang, one of Chu Kuei-ying’s\\n\\nneighbours. Gripping Chu Kuei-ying’s arm, she asked, “Where\\nare you going?”\\n\\n“To Chang Ah-hsin’s place.”\\n\\n“It’s no good going there: they’ve all gone over to Yao Chin-\\nfeng\\'s. Come on, let’s go over together.”\\n\\nThe two girls retraced their steps and turned left. As they\\nwalked along, Chin Hsiao-mei poured out all the latest news,\\nand as she listened Chu Kuei-ying glowed with excitement, so\\nthat she forgot that it was raining and that her clothes were wet\\nthrough. So Yao Chin-feng is out to lead us again! Then Hsueh\\nPao-chu must have been wrong when she accused her of being\\na spy for the boss. Who else? Chou Erh-chieh and Chien Chiao-\\nlin? Well! But Chien Chiao-lin is Chien Pao-sheng’s sister, isn’t\\nshe? And now even she’s having a go! Fancy that! So the\\nworkers are ready to help their mates after all!\\n\\nSoon they were approaching Yao Chin-feng’s home. This was\\nalso a straw-and-mud affair but cleaner than most and boasting\\na wooden door. While they were still some distance away they\\ncould hear a babel of voices from inside. Chu Kuei-ying’s heart\\nleapt for joy. The last meeting—when they had decided to\\n“go slow”’—had been nowhere near as noisy and daring as this:\\nit had been held in secret, and very quietly.\\n\\nChin Hsiao-mei dashed forward to open the door, and as Chu\\nKuei-ying squeezed in she was met by a breath of hot, close air\\nand the reek of sweat. The room was packed and everyone\\nseemed to be shouting at once. An oil lamp shed a pool of light\\nno more than a few feet square, and in this pool of light was a\\nplump white face with drooping eyelids—Chien Chiao-lin, of all\\npeople!\\n\\n“Tt’s all the fault of Kuei Chang-lin and Chamber-pot Tu!”\\nshe was shouting, while a teardrop oozed out from under one of\\nher drooping eyelids. “They’re always crawling round the boss!\\nWe must strike! We must strike tomorrow! We\\'ve got to beat\\nthese two crawlers!”\\n\\n“Strike! That’s right: strike! There’s several factories in\\nHongkew already out!”\\n\\n“Shouldn\\'t we send somebody to get in touch with them—?”\\n\\n“When they come round and burst into the factory tomorrow,\\nwe\\'ll down tools and march out!”\\n\\nFrom this medley of voices Chu Kuei-ying could only identify\\nthat of the last speaker—Hsu Ah-yi, a woman in her thirties who\\nwas ordinarily timid and quiet.\\n\\n“Sling Chamber-pot Tu out of the factory!—And Kuei Chang-\\nlin with him!” bawled dumpy little Chou Erh-chieh, poking her\\nhead out from behind Chien Chiao-lin, but immediately another\\nvoice shouted:\\n\\n“Sling Chien Pao-sheng out, as well! We don’t want a trade\\nunion that’s out to swindle us! We want a trade union of our\\nown!”\\n\\nA deathly hush suddenly descended on the room, and sweat-\\nbeaded faces peered this way and that to see who had spoken. It\\nwas Ho Hsiu-mei, her face flushed and her staring eyes fixed on\\nChien Chiao-lin. Almost at once the tense silence was broken,\\nand Yao Chin-feng’s little oval face with its faint white pockmarks\\nflashed in the dim pool of light from the oil lamp.\\n\\n“That’s right!” she shrilled. “Sling Chien Pao-sheng out and\\nsling his stooge out with him! Chou Erh-chieh’s his stooge!”\\n\\n“You bitch! You’re Chamber-pot Tu’s stooge yourself!”\\nscreamed Chou Erh-chieh. She sprang up and flew at Yao Chin-\\nfeng, and for a moment the two of them struggled together. The\\ngirls came to Yao Chin-feng’s rescue and parted them. As they\\nhustled Chou Erh-chieh away into a corner, they all shouted\\nat her:\\n\\n“The one who starts a fight first is always in the wrong!”\\n\\n“Listen, girls!” panted Yao Chin-feng. ‘When I say that Chou\\nErh-chieh is Chien Pao-sheng’s stooge, I know what I’m talking\\nabout! He’s sent her here to spy on us!”\\n\\nShe ran her eyes over the circle of faces to see what effect her\\naccusation would have. All at once pandemonium broke out\\nagain and it was impossible to hear what anybody was Saying.\\nOne thing, however, was clear to everybody: Chou Erh-chieh was\\nup to no good at this meeting! Chang Ah-hsin’s voice alone could\\nbe heard shrilling above the din.\\n\\n“Chien Chiao-lin’s here to spy on us, as well! She can’t be\\nany good if she’s Chien Pao-sheng’s sister! Throw her out!”\\n\\n“She\\'s always flirting with that new fellow Tseng!” cried an-\\nother voice. “And he’s the boss’s cousin or something!”\\n\\nAll was confusion now, and if at this moment Chou Erh-chieh\\nor Chien Chiao-lin had shown the slightest sign of protest, they\\nwould have been beaten up. Taken completely unawares by this\\nsudden attack, they did not know quite what to do for a moment.\\nOne thing was clear to both of them: it would be unhealthy\\nto stay just now. At the first opportunity they slipped out.\\nThis gave Chu Kuei-ying a chance to edge further into the room,\\nand she almost managed to get through to Chang Ah-hsin.\\n\\n“They\\'ve got away!’ shouted the timid Hsu Ah-yi at the top\\nof her voice, trying to push her way through the crowd. ‘“They’re\\nsure to go and report us! We\\'ll have to break up straight away!”\\n\\nThey all heard what she said, but no one agreed.\\n\\n“No, no, don’t break up yet! Don’t be scared! We haven’t\\ndecided anything yet!”\\n\\n“Pirst thing tomorrow morning, we should elect our represent-\\natives and then walk out on strike!”\\n\\n“And then we\\'ll break into Wu Sun-fu’s new factories and make\\nthe girls down tools and join us! We\\'ll go round all the factories\\nin Chapei and make them all come out on strike with us!”\\n\\n“I think we’d better send somebody round to see the strikers\\nin Hongkew first. If they\\'ll come and break into our factory,\\nwe\\'ll shut down the machines and join them!”\\n\\nThis proposal to “wait and see” was made in an anxious voice\\nand came from a girl standing right beside Chu Kuei-ying. She\\nrecognized her as Lu Hsiao-pao.\\n\\n“Pah! Only a crawler would wait for a walk-in from outside!”\\nsnapped Ho Hsiu-mei, and spat at Lu Hsiao-pao. Lu Hsiao-pao\\nstood her ground, and the two of them indulged in a brief slanging-\\nmatch.\\n\\nThe question was now whether they should wait for a walk-\\nin from outside or whether they should walk out themselves and\\nthen break into the other factories, and on this point the eight\\nor so girls were divided into two groups; Ho Hsiu-mei, Chang Ah-\\nhsin, and one or two others, including Chu Kuei-ying, were for\\nwalking out of their own accord, and in this Yao Chin-feng also\\nagreed with them. Each of the girls represented two or three\\nrows of girls in their workshops, so any resolution made this\\nevening could be carried out the next day. Hsu Ah-yi now urged\\nthem once more:\\n\\n“Come on, hurry up! They must have gone and reported us\\nby now. Somebody’s sure to come round!”\\n\\nIt was at this moment that Chin Hsiao-mei squeezed hurriedly\\nin through the crowd to say that she had just seen several\\n“toughs” walking up and down in the vicinity as if they were\\nlooking for somebody. Everybody looked alarmed except Yao\\nChin-feng, who knew what it meant as she had been told all\\nabout it by Ah Chen. Nevertheless, she seized this opportunity to\\nsuggest that they should close the meeting now and make the\\nfinal decision in the workshop next morning. Her “mission” was\\naccomplished, and she was anxious to dash off and report to Ah\\nChen how she had got on at the meeting.\\n\\nIt was not raining so hard now, but it was chilly outside and\\nthe girls shivered as they came out of the hut. Chu Kuei-ying,\\nChang Ah-hsin, and another girl, Chen Yueh-ngo, went off arm\\nin arm and huddled close together. Chen Yueh-ngo whispered\\nin Chang Ah-hsin’s ear:\\n\\n“Looks as if there’s really going to be a strike tomorrow! Ma\\nChin’s still waiting for us to report back.”\\n\\n“Let’s go there straight away,” replied Chang Ah-hsin, also in\\na whisper. “Though it’s very cold, and we\\'ll get wet through\\nagain.”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying overheard what they were saying, and it re-\\nminded her that Tu Wei-yueh had not long ago been offering to\\npromote her to forewoman to buy her over. She was just going\\nto tell her friends about it, when she suddenly caught sight of\\nan individual in a black gown slip out from a side-turning and tag\\nalong behind them. She immediately nudged Chang Ah-hsin and\\npointed over her shoulder with her lips. Chen Yueh-ngo spotted\\nhim at the same time; she dug Chang Ah-hsin in the ribs with\\nher elbow and deliberately raised her voice:\\n\\n“Br-r-r! Isn’t it cold tonight! Well, Ah-hsin, we\\'ll have to say\\ngood-night now. See you tomorrow!”\\n\\nThe three of them unlinked their arms and went off in three\\ndifferent directions.\\n\\nWhen she had gone a few steps, Chen Yueh-ngo turned her\\nhead and stared hard over her shoulder: the black-gowned in-\\ndividual was following hard on Chang Ah-hsin’s heels. Her heart\\nmissed a beat, for she knew that Chang Ah-hsin did not always\\n\\nkeep her wits about her. She immediately stopped and shouted,\\n“Ah-hsin! You\\'ve left your handkerchief in my hand!”\\n\\nChang Ab-hsin looked round and then she, too, saw the fellow\\nin the black gown behind her. She shouted back, “Keep it till\\ntomorrow,” and headed straight for home. He of the black gown\\nagain emerged from the shadows and paced stolidly on behind\\nher.\\n\\nWhen she had made sure that she herself was not being tailed,\\nChen Yueh-ngo quickened her steps. Leaving the slum behind\\nher, she turned into a squalid alleyway. When she reached the\\nother end she tapped three times on the back door of a house\\nand she slipped quickly inside.\\n\\nThe front-room upstairs was furnished with three rickety beds\\nand one square table. Two girls with their hair cut short were\\nsitting hunched over the table, writing something by the dim light\\nof a solitary bulb hanging from the ceiling. Chen Yueh-ngo crept\\nin very quietly, but the two girls heard her coming. One of them\\nraised a vivid pair of eyes and greeted her with a stare, then\\nlowered her head and went on with her writing. As she wrote\\nshe said to the other girl:\\n\\n“you\\'d better hurry up and finish, Tsai Chen. Yueh-ngo’s here,\\nand it’s getting late, so we\\'d better start the discussion straight\\naway.”\\n\\n“All right, let’s get started,” said the girl addressed as Tsai\\nChen, stretching and putting down her pen. “We can finish the\\nwriting off afterwards.”\\n\\nShe stood up and stretched again. She was taller than Chen\\nYueh-ngo, and, like her, she wore a short white calico jacket and\\na pair of baggy black slacks. She was dressed like one of the\\ngirls from the silk factory, but her sophisticated expression and\\nmanner proclaimed her to be an intellectual. Her eyes were\\nheavy for lack of sleep and her face was pale.\\n\\nThe other girl also stopped writing. Her sharp, vivacious eyes\\nflashed a glance at Chen Yueh-ngo as she asked quickly, “Well,\\nYueh-ngo, how are things going in the factory? If you can get\\nthings moving tomorrow, we\\'ve got a good chance of bringing\\noff a general strike involving all the silk factories in the Chapei\\narea.”\\n\\nAfter a struggle, Chen Yueh-ngo managed to give some account\\nof what had happened in the factory during the day and at the\\nmeeting a short while ago in Yao Chin-feng’s hut. Her diction\\nwas of the simplest, but she larded it freely with some of the\\njargon she had lately picked up—the women’s “spirit of struggle”\\nwas running high; given “leadership,” there was no question of\\ntheir not being “mobilized” immediately. She was very excited,\\nand every now and then she interrupted her report to recover her\\nbreath. Beads of perspiration glistened on her forehead.\\n\\n“Same situation as in Hongkew,” commented Tsai Chen; then,\\nmaking a clean sweep of the questions left unanswered by Chen\\nYueh-ngo’s report, she concluded briskly, “Your people must walk\\nout tomorrow without fail, and after that they must go round\\nbringing out the other factories until we’ve got a general strike\\nof all the silk factories in Chapei!’”\\n\\nHer keen-eyed companion, Ma Chin, had made no comment,\\nbut still watched Chen Yueh-ngo with an intense stare, as if\\ntrying to detect any exaggerations the latter might be making\\nin her “report.” She had the feeling that there were some com-\\nplicated problems involved in the “report,” yet, not being a swift\\nthinker, she could not for the moment make an accurate analysis\\nof what these problems were—she just had a vague sense of\\nuneasiness.\\n\\nOutside the window the rain was hissing down and the lightning\\nwas flashing again. A tense silence hung over the room.\\n\\n“Come on, Ma Chin, let’s hear your decision!’ Tsai Chen\\nurged impatiently, drumming her pen on the table. “We’ve got\\nother things to do yet.”\\n\\nAs Tsai Chen looked at it, the question was simple enough:\\n“the workers’ spirit of struggle was running high’ because the\\n“high tide of revolution” was at this moment sweeping the coun-\\ntry! Since March, there had been strikes by the bus- and tram-\\ndrivers in the International Settlement and by the workers in\\nthe power-house in the Frencn Concession. The “spontaneous\\nstruggle” of the workers had been kept up without a break in\\nfactories all over Shanghai, and every “economic struggle” had\\na way of turning instantly into a “political struggle,” with the\\nresult that “the revolution had now reached high tide.’ Tsai\\n\\nChen had heard all this time and again from Ke Tso-fu and had\\nadopted it as her own formula for thinking.\\n\\nThis “formula” sounded simple, clear and “reasonable,” and,\\nalong with a lot of other jargon, had been firmly memorized by\\nChen Yueh-ngo and through her instilled into the minds of Chang\\nAh-hsin and Ho Hsiu-mei, whose simple minds and warm hearts\\nwere just the right sort of fertile soil for “formulas” of this kind.\\n\\nMa Chin, however, thought differently, she felt that there were\\nflaws in Tsai Chen’s “formula,” but, with her scanty knowledge\\nand experience, she was unable to explain just where—she just\\nfelt it was so. Besides, it was not in her nature to make hasty\\nstatements; she preferred to go over all the facts first. This was\\nthe reason for her present hesitation about Chen Yueh-ngo’s\\nreport. Now that Tsai Chen was hurrying her up, she just had\\nto express what she felt as best she could.\\n\\n“There’s no point in rushing things. We must study the situa-\\ntion carefully. Yueh-ngo says Yao Chin-feng’s putting up a better\\nshow this time, but don’t forget she wasn’t all that reliable last\\ntime. Besides, she may be Kuei Chang-lin’s tool in the war be-\\ntween the yellow trade union factions. Maybe she’s wormed her\\nway in to win over the masses and lead a strike herself for her\\nown ends. I think we must take all this into consideration before\\nwe can make a decision.”\\n\\n“you\\'re wrong!” Tsai Chen immediately expostulated. “The\\nfact is, the revolutionary spirit of the masses has put an end to\\nYao Chin-feng’s wavering. What’s more, you\\'re disregarding the\\nfighting spirit of the masses at a time when the tide of revolu-\\ntion is in full flood, you’re underestimating the power of the\\nmasses to discipline wavering elements, and you think that the\\ntools of a yellow trade union can lead the masses! You\\'re taking\\na rightist view of things!”\\n\\nAs she reeled off her formulas and scraps of jargon one after\\nthe other, her pasty face became flushed. Chen Yueh-ngo sat\\nlistening, and although she did not understand much of what\\nTsai Chen was saying, she was quite impressed by it.\\n\\nMa Chin also flushed and at once demanded, “What do you\\nmean, ‘rightist view’!”\\n\\n“T mean that you doubt the great revolutionary power of the\\nmasses and that you fail to see the upsurge of the fighting spirit\\n\\nof the masses!” said Tsai Chen, glibly quoting another formula\\nMa Chin’s face suddenly paled. She sprang to her feet and said\\nharshly:\\n\\n“I’m not taking a rightist view! I’m only trying to analyse a\\ncomplicated fact. I suspect Yao Chin-feng of covering something\\nup with her leftist exhibition!’\\n\\n“Well, have we got to stop rousing the masses to action just\\nbecause we\\'re afraid that Yao Chin-feng might take over the\\nleadership from us, then? If that isn’t a rightist point of view,\\nwhat is it?”\\n\\n“I didn’t say we’d got to stop activating the masses! All I’m\\nproposing is that we should decide our tactics before we begin\\nlaunching the masses into action.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by ‘tactics’? So you\\'re thinking of decid-\\ning our tactics, eh? You\\'re forgetting our general line! That’s\\nwhat you call rightist deviation!”\\n\\n“Tm not going to start arguing with you about rightism and\\nleftism, Tsai Chen. All I’m concerned with is whether or not\\nwe’re going to find ways and means of dealing with the two\\nyellow trade union factions and their stooges in the Yu Hua\\nSilk Factory.”\\n\\n“Pooh! ‘Ways and means’? You’re not suggesting we should\\nplay one clique off against the other? Why, that’s opportunism!\\nThe one correct way is to go all out to raise the revolutionary\\nspirit of the masses to the utmost and provide correct leadership\\nfor their great revolutionary power!”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I know all about that, but these theoretical problems\\ncan be discussed later at a group meeting. What we\\'ve got to\\ndiscuss now is the practical side. Yueh-ngo’s waited long enough\\nfor our decision. I propose that when we get the ‘strike going\\ntomorrow we should ask Yao Chin-feng to make up her mind\\nwhere she stands—”\\n\\n“T think we can quite safely leave it to the masses to keep an\\neye on her,” said Tsai Chen with casual confidence and a mocking\\nsmile. In the ordinary way she had great respect for Ma Chin,\\nwho was hard-working, unafraid of hardships, and correct in her\\nviews; but at this particular moment she was beginning to have\\nher doubts about her—at least, she suspected Ma Chin of shrink-\\ning in the face of the “high tide of revolution.”\\n\\n“we needn\\'t be afraid of Yao Chin-feng playing tricks,” Chen\\nYueh-ngo chimed in. “The girls will make short work of any-\\nbody they find ratting! Yao Chin-feng wouldn\\'t dare risk it.”\\n\\nHer patience was rapidly being exhausted, though mainly be-\\ncause she did not understand all these formulas and scraps of\\njargon which Tsai Chen and Ma Chin were using. Nevertheless,\\nshe was a factory worker with an ardent revolutionary spirit and\\nwas very eager to learn all she could, so she continued to listen\\npatiently.\\n\\n“T suspect that Yao Chin-feng has already ratted!—Oh, come\\non, let’s stop arguing and decide what we’re going to do once\\nwe\\'ve got the strike started.”\\n\\nWith this call for a truce in the interminable controversy of\\nformula versus formula, Ma Chin sorted through the papers she\\nhad just been working on, picked up one of them and began\\nreading out the programme she had jotted down. The discussion\\nnow centred on purely practical issues: the formation of a strike\\ncommittee and the nomination of committee members, terms\\nfor the resumption of work, liaison with other factories on\\nstrike in Chapei, contact with factories in Hongkew.... Now\\nthat they were coming down to brass tacks, Chen Yueh-ngo joined\\nin the discussion instead of just listening to the other two. Each\\nof them had plenty to say and their faces were flushed with\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\nMeanwhile the crash of thunder, the lightning and the tor-\\nrential rain raged through the night with ever-increasing fury,\\nuntil the house rocked precariously; but the three girls were\\noblivious of all this, for they were completely engrossed in the\\nother storm that was coming.\\nXIV\\n\\nW HEN the night of storm had passed, daybreak brought a gentle\\nbreeze and scattered, rose-tinted patches of cloud, and the rising\\nsun was a blood-red disc.\\n\\nThe several hundred spinning-machines in the Yu Hua Filature\\nthat had been running at full pressure suddenly stopped. The\\nthunder of the oppressed was being unleashed! The girls surged\\nout of the workshop like a tidal wave, swept across to the notice-\\nboard in front of the office like an angry squall, scattered the\\nhandful of clerks who had come out to see what it was all about,\\nand tore down the notice which had just been put up announc-\\ning the wage-cut.\\n\\n“Down with the blacklegs! Down with the crawlers!\"\\n\\n“Death to Chien Pao-sheng and Hsueh Pao-chu!”\\n\\n“No wage-cut! We want Sunday overtime! We want a cost-\\nof-living allowance!”\\n\\nThundering their demands, the crowd of angry women spread\\nout in line and closed in on the office, which represented their\\nshackles — the shackles they were going to break asunder!\\n\\n“Down with Chamber-pot Tu!”\\n\\n“Sling out Kuei Chang-lin and Wang Chin-chen!”\\n\\nThe crowd was shouting raggedly now, instead of in chorus as\\nat first. The main body of the women had now surged forward\\nto the veranda in front of the row of office buildings, which they\\nhad by now surrounded; but their progress was blocked by\\nPockmarked Li and his twenty bullies, who were swearing at\\nthem and threatening them with lead-weighted lengths of hose.\\nAmong them was Ah Hsiang, who kept glancing at Pockmarked\\nLi to see what he would do. The latter, however, had not re-\\nceived his orders to go into action, so they could only stand\\nguard and hold themselves in readiness.\\n\\nSuddenly, Tu Wei-yueh’s slim figure made its appearance be-\\nfore the door of the office. He held himself erect, and his face\\nwore its customary sardonic smile.\\n\\nThe crowd was taken aback: he was certainly a game ’un, this\\n“Chamber-pot”! But their hesitation was momentary, and the\\nnext instant they were surging forward with redoubled boldness,\\nuntil they were almost on top of Li’s strong-arm men. Their\\nshouting had risen to a deafening roar: they were angry, and\\nthey were ready for a deliberate, all-out attack on their enemy,\\na hand-to-hand encounter! Their smouldering anger had been\\nfanned into flame at last! One detachment of the crowd had\\nalready poured on to the other end of the veranda. There was\\na crash and tinkle of breaking glass. The first blow had been\\nstruck! The crowd fanned out and moved in to the attack. Any\\nmoment now the storm would break.\\n\\nPockmarked Li could wait no longer, and he and his twenty\\nmen struck out wildly at the section of the crowd which was\\nclosing in on them, though they retreated step by step as they\\nfought.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh also stepped back. Suddenly, someone sprang out\\nfrom behind him. It was Wu Wei-cheng.\\n\\n“Go on, Li, give em what for!” he yelled. “Give the bitches\\na good hiding! Run ’em in!”\\n\\n“Pitch into ’em!... Call the police! Open fire!” yelled two\\nother voices: Ma Ching-shan and Tseng Chia-chu were hanging\\nout of a window to shout encouragement.\\n\\nPockmarked Li and his men were still retreating, fighting as\\nthey went. In the mélée several of the women had become caught\\nup in the middle of the bullies and were now trying hard\\nto fight their way out. The main body of the crowd had by\\nnow got on to the veranda, and the office was on the point\\nof “falling”? at any moment. At this juncture, however, their\\nrear was thrown into confusion by the arrival of a dozen or so\\npolicemen, who charged into the crowd, using their bayonets\\nto clear a way. Pockmarked Li and his men immediately took\\nthe offensive, and the five or six women who had been cornered\\nwere now seized by the bullies. The main body of the crowd\\ndrew back slightly, and the policemen took up positions on the\\n\\nporch.\\n\\nFar from retreating, the women stood their ground, shouting\\nangrily and rallying for a second attack.\\n\\nWu Wei-cheng, Ma Ching-shan, and Tseng Chia-chu came\\ndashing out together and stamped their feet as they yelled at\\nthe top of their voices:\\n\\n“Open fire! Finish the bitches off!”\\n\\nThe crowd’s reaction was immediate: their ranks stirred and\\nthey began moving forward with a deafening roar. The\\npolicemen automatically raised their rifles. Suddenly, Tu Wei-\\nyueh stepped out again and stopped them with a wave of the\\nhand, at the same time shouting at the top of his voice:\\n\\n“Don’t open fire!... Girls, listen to me! We\\'re not going to\\nshoot at you! Just listen to me for a moment!”\\n\\n“We don’t want to listen to your bluff! Clear off!” roared a\\nsmall group of women in the crowd, still moving resolutely for-\\nward. But the majority stopped and stood still.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled calmly and walked out on to the steps in\\nfront of the veranda.\\n\\n“Now, be sensible,” he bellowed. “You don\\'t imagine your\\nbare fists are going to be any good against guns and bayonets?\\nYou swear at me and want to kick me out, but we’re all in this\\ntogether you and me. We all depend on the factory for a\\nliving, and if you smash up the factory, you\\'ll be taking the\\nfood out of your own mouths! If you\\'ve got any demands, go\\nback and send a representative to discuss them with me. Now,\\ngo on back! I’m the only one here still in favour of a peaceful\\nsettlement! If you go on making trouble like this, you\\'ll be\\nthe losers by it!”\\n\\nSuddenly, Kuei Chang-lin slipped out and went across to the\\nmain body of the women, who were standing still and seemed\\nto have calmed down.\\n\\n“Mr. Tu’s quite right!” he shouted. “Everybody go on back\\nnow and leave it to the union to take the matter up with the\\nmanagement! We won’t let you down!”\\n\\n“We don’t want anything to do with your lousy union!” shrilled\\na voice from the crowd. “We\\'ll have a union of our own!”\\n\\nBy now even the small group of women had stopped, and a\\nconfused jabber of voices rose from the main body of the crowd.\\nIt was clear that they were no longer shouting for an attack,\\n\\nbut were busy arguing among themselves about what their next\\nstep should be. All at once, one of the girls left the crowd to\\naddress them. It was Yao Chin-feng.\\n\\n“Listen, girls!’ she shouted. ‘“They’re holding half-a-dozen\\nof us! If they don’t let them go, we\\'ll carry on to the bitter\\nend!”\\n\\nThe crowd’s response was a deafening roar. There was some-\\nthing else they wanted now! Yao Chin-feng took a step forward\\nand looked Tu Wei-yueh straight in the eyes:\\n\\n“Let the girls go!”\\n\\n“You can’t do that!” yelled Wu Wei-cheng as he and the\\nother two squeezed out to the front. Pockmarked Li looked\\nat Tu Wei-yueh, and saw that he was smiling his usual cold\\nsmile. Quite firmly, Tu Wei-yueh gave Pockmarked Li his orders:\\n\\n“Let them go!”\\n\\n“They’ve let them go!” yelled Kuei Chang-lin at the top of\\nhis voice, running round the main body of the crowd. “They\\'ve\\nlet them go! Everybody can go back now! If you’ve got any\\ndemands you can send up a representative to discuss them!”\\n\\nThe crowd cheered and the human tide began to move again,\\nbut this time it had changed direction and was moving towards\\nthe main gate. As she went along, Ho Hsiu-mei shouted, “Down\\nwith Chamber-pot Tu! Down with Kuei Chang-lin!” but only a\\nhundred or so voices took up her slogan. Then: “Down with\\nChien Pao-sheng!” shouted Yao Chin-feng, and this time the\\nwhole crowd took up the cry. Chen Yueh-ngo and Chang Ah-\\nhsin walked along together, their jaws set firm. Chen Yueh-\\nngo now recalled the argument between Ma Chin and Tsai Chen\\nthe night before. She was afraid that the plan to march into\\nthe other factories might now fall through.\\n\\nNevertheless, when the crowd had surged up to the gate-way,\\nand Chang Ah-hsin shouted, “March into the other factories!”\\nthe crowd’s response was as deafening as ever:\\n\\n“March into the other factories! Let’s break into the ‘new\\nfactory’ first!”\\n\\n“General strike! We want a trade union of our own!”\\n\\nThey thundered their way across the street and stormed into\\nWu Sun-fu’s “new factory.” The workers of two factories\\njoined forces and marched into a third factory, then into a\\n\\nfourth, swelling their ranks to two thousand, three thousand,\\nfour thousand, five thousand, so that in less than an hour every\\nsilk filature in Chapei, large or small, was out on strike. The\\nwhole area was in a state of tension, and police patrols were\\ndoubled.\\n\\nThe workshop of the Yu Hua Filature was as silent as the\\ngrave. Four policemen had been posted at the main gate. In-\\nside the office, on the other hand, the atmosphere was unusually\\ntense. Wu Wei-cheng, Ma Ching-shan, and Tseng Chia-chu\\nwere badgering Tu Wei-yueh and accusing him of being a weak-\\nling. Tu Wei-yueh made no attempt to argue with them, but\\njust smiled his usual cool, unruffled smile.\\n\\nA motorcar horn blared furiously from the main gate. Tu Wei-\\nyueh strolled calmly out of the office to find that Wu Sun-fu had\\nalready got out of his car. His face was livid with fury and his\\neyes blazed. He did not give anybody so much as a look,\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng stood to one side, his head drooping and his\\nface deathly pale.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh squared his shoulders and walked across to Wu\\nSun-fu with a cool, open smile.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu threw him a glance, then, without a word, beckoned\\nthe two of them to follow him. He went first to look at the\\nbroken office window, then made a tour of inspection through\\nthe deserted workshop and every other part of the factory. When\\nhe saw that no other damage had been done, his expression\\ngradually relaxed.\\n\\nFinally, he went into his office and settled himself down to\\nhear Tu Wei-yueh’s report.\\n\\nGolden sunlight was streaming in through the window, and a\\ngolden-coloured electric fan was turning from side to side behind\\nWu Sun-fu’s back. Dark shadows moved across the window as\\nsome eavesdroppers strolled to and fro outside. Tu Wei-yueh\\nnoticed them quite clearly as he made his report, and smiled\\nsardonically to himself.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu listened with his brows drawn together in a frown.\\nHis lips were pressed tightly together and his keen glance darted\\nall round. Suddenly, he broke in with impatience, “Do you think\\n\\nthey\\'d dare smash the machines? Or set fire to the premises?\\nOr start a riot?”\\n\\n“They\\'re like a lot of raving lunatics at the moment, and I\\nwouldn’t put anything past them. Though it can’t last long: once\\nthe crowds dispersed they’ll quieten down again.”\\n\\n“In other words, you think we’re very lucky to have come\\nthrough it with nothing worse than a broken window, eh? That’s\\nwhat you\\'d call a victory for us, I suppose?”\\n\\nThere was an edge to Wu Sun-fu’s voice as he said this, and\\nhis eyes glinted coldly. Tu Wei-yueh drew himself up and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“] hear we\\'ve caught several of the rioters red-handed,” Wu\\nSun-fu went on icily. ‘“You’ve turned them over to the police,\\n1 suppose?”\\n\\nTu Wei-yuch saw straight away what was behind this ques-\\ntion: he guessed that someone had already reported the girls’\\nrelease to Wu Sun-fu—and had done a lot more back-biting at\\nthe same time, no doubt. He kept a straight face and said, “I’ve\\nalready let them go.”\\n\\n“What! Just let them go like that? And I suppose you did\\nthat to save my factory, eh? Huh!”\\n\\n“No, not at all! As you said yourself only the other day, ‘You\\ncan’t net them all.’ Besides, there’s no point at all in detaining\\nhalf-a-dozen sheep who just follow the crowd.”\\n\\nSensing the second piece of sarcasm, Tu Wei-yueh paid Wu\\nSun-fu back in his own coin. He threw out his chest and put\\non a look as much as to say, “You can kill a gentleman but you\\ncannot insult him.” He knew that this was a good way of bring-\\ning the violent, refractory Wu Sun-fu to heel.\\n\\nFor a while neither of them spoke. A shadow flitted across\\nthe window again. This time Wu Sun-fu also saw it. He\\nfrowned. He realized quite well what was going on, and he had\\nnever liked this kind of sneaking, creeping monkey-business.\\nHe laughed grimly and said in an intentionally loud voice:\\n\\n“All right, Wei-yueh, I give you a free hand! But we\\'re start-\\ning work tomorrow! Got it? Tomorrow!”\\n\\n“Pll do my best to carry out your instructions, sir,” replied\\nTu Wei-yueh in an equally loud voice. He realized that his own\\n“régime” was safe again for the time being. Wu Sun-fu smiled\\n\\nand waved him away, but as Tu Wei-yueh rose to go, Wu Sun-fu\\nsuddenly said:\\n\\n“T hear certain people in the factory don’t hit it off with you\\nIs that right?”\\n\\n‘Who exactly are you referring to, sir?”\\n\\n“People in the office, your colleagues.”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know anything about it. I can hardly imagine\\nanybody being like that. We all are working for you, Mr. Wu,\\nand you treat us all the same. Whatever authority you give me\\nis only so that I can carry out your instructions.”\\n\\nThough he spoke calmly and unhurriedly, Tu Wei-yueh had a\\nsinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He made a slight but\\ngrave bow and left the room.\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng was summoned in next. As the old fellow\\ncame into the room he was trembling at the knees. The moment\\nhe clapped eyes on him, Wu Sun-fu felt a twinge of annoyance.\\nHe deliberately avoided looking at the pitiful-looking old crea-\\nture, and sat silent, his eyes fixed on the flickering patterns of\\nlight and shade on the window. His mind was occupied with\\nthe problem of Tu Wei-yueh: Surely the fellow couldn\\'t really\\nbe ignorant of the fact that certain people in the office were not\\nsatisfied with the way he had handled things today? No! He\\nmust know! But why wouldn’t he admit it? Was he afraid of\\nlosing face? Pride, that was it! This young man did have plenty\\nof pride, too. Well, let’s wait and see how he acquits himself\\ntoday!... Suddenly, Wu Sun-fu was assailed by a doubt. He\\nshook his head vigorously, then turned to Mo Kan-cheng and\\nsaid in a harsh voice:\\n\\n“Kan-cheng, you’re a senior member of the staff. When you\\nfind these youngsters quarrelling, it’s up to you to sort things out\\nand make peace between them!”\\n\\n“But sir—”\\n\\n“Hold your tongue! You know very well I don’t like people\\ncoming and whispering to me against this one and that. I’m\\ncapable of making up my own mind, so I don’t need to listen\\nto gossip! I can see quite clearly who’s any good and who’s not,\\nand anybody who comes and blows his own trumpet to me is\\nwasting his breath! Understand? Go and tell them, then!”\\n\\n“Very good, sir!”\\n\\n“TI also hear that Tseng Chia-chu and Tu Wei-yueh are fighting\\nfor the same girl, and that there was a little to-do here last night.\\nThat true?”\\n\\n“T,,,I don’t know much about it.”\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng was flustered, and his miserable expression was\\nalmost laughable. As a matter of fact, he knew all about it,\\nbut he was afraid to say anything with the echoes of Wu Sun-fu’s\\nharangue still ringing in his ears. Realizing what was worrying\\nhim, Wu Sun-fu laughed despite himself and went on, “What do\\nyou mean, you don’t know much about it! Can’t you even\\nanswer a straightforward question when I ask you? I know\\njust what you people in the office are like: you\\'ve got no\\nears for anything decent: all you’re ever interested in is bits of\\nscandal. The minute there’s some rivalry over a girl, your ears\\nstart flapping. I hear Tu Wei-yueh’s to blame in this case. He\\nsets a bad example, doesn’t he?”\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng just stood and gaped wide-eyed. For a moment\\nhe could not make up his mind what to do: should he confirm\\nwhat Wu Sun-fu had said? Or should he tell the truth? In the\\nend, he decided to tell the truth. After all, Tu Wei-yueh still\\nenjoyed Wu Sun-fu’s confidence.\\n\\n“Mr, Wu, the fact of the matter is, young Mr. Tseng’s really\\ngone too far—”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu nodded and smiled, and Mo Kan-cheng felt en-\\ncouraged to go on. “Wang Chin-chen, forewoman No. 2, saw it\\nall with her own eyes. All I know is what she’s told me: Mr.\\nTu hasn’t mentioned a single word to me about it yet. Last night,\\nMr. Tu sent Wang Chin-chen to fetch one of the girls—Chu Kuei-\\nying—up to the office to ask her which of the girls had anything\\nto do with the Communists—as a matter of fact, they were in\\nthis very room, and Wang Chin-chen was here, too. Afterwards,\\nwhen Chu Kuei-ying was leaving the factory, she had just got\\nto the cocoon-store, when young Mr. Tseng stopped her and\\nstarted annoying her. We didn’t hear her shouting or anything,\\nbecause it was in the middle of a thunderstorm, but Mr. Tu and\\nWang Chin-chen happened to run into them and saw what was\\nhappening. Well, that’s the long and the short of it.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu knit his brows in silence. He could see it all now.\\nHe realized that the account his nephew Wu Wei-cheng had\\n\\ngiven him of things was a completely distorted one. It suddenly\\nstruck him that it had been a mistake to put three of his rela-\\ntives—Tseng Chia-chu, Ma Ching-shan and Wu Wei-cheng—in\\nthe same factory: there would be no end of trouble from them!\\n\\n“I see! Now, Kan-cheng, go and tell everybody in the office\\nthat there’s to be no more gossiping about it!”\\n\\nWith this, Wu Sun-fu waved Mo Kan-cheng away. He tilted\\nhis head on one side and thought for a moment, then picked up\\na pen with the intention of writing a memorandum about trans-\\nferring his three relatives to three of the factories run by the Yi\\nChung Trust Company. You can’t run a factory properly when\\nit\\'s chock-full of relations and old friends! With this thought, he\\nset to work on the memorandum, but he had hardly begun when\\nhe was interrupted by an uninvited visitor—his nephew Wu Wei-\\ncheng.\\n\\n“Who sent you here?” he snapped irritably, throwing the pen\\nback on the table. “Mo Kan-cheng?”\\n\\nHe glared sharply at Wu Wei-cheng’s rather intelligent-looking\\nface. Closing the door behind him, Wu Wei-cheng remained on\\nthe other side of the room away from the desk. His manner was\\ncalm and self-possessed as he spoke:\\n\\n“I’ve got something to tell you, Uncle.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu frowned, but let him go on.\\n\\n“Chien Pao-sheng’s just told me that the girls had a meeting\\nlast night in one of the girls’ homes—Yao Chin-feng’s. When\\nthe girls rioted today, she was one of those who wanted to smash\\nup the office. She was also the one who shouted to the crowd\\nto fight it out if we refused to release the six girls that we’d ar-\\nrested. It was this same girl, Yao Chin-feng, who was the back-\\nstage ringleader when we had that trouble in the factory a month\\nago. They say that Tu Wei-yueh managed to buy her over after\\nthat, but the meeting last night was actually held in her hut!\\nShe’s very radical and I’m sure she’s still a secret ringleader.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was watching his nephew’s face intently. He\\nsmiled faintly, but said nothing. He had already heard from Tu\\nWei-yueh that Yao Chin-feng had been present at the girls’ meet-\\ning the night before, so he had learned nothing new from what\\nWu Wei-cheng had told him. Nevertheless, the mention of Yao\\nChin-feng’s name aroused some association in his mind. He re-\\n\\nmembered that she was a woman of about thirty, tall and slim,\\nwith a small oval face faintly marked by smallpox. He also re-\\nmembered that after Tu Wei-yueh had bought her over there had\\nbeen a slight hitch: one of the forewomen, Hsueh Pao-chu, had\\ngiven the game away—though the trouble had been smoothed out\\nafterwards.\\n\\n“So far as I can see, Uncle, this present trouble is the result\\nof Tu Wei-yueh’s connivance. He could easily have done some-\\nthing to prevent it yesterday, but he didn’t. And then this morn-\\ning, all he did was to play the kind good-hearted mediator! He’s\\nin league with that trade union fellow Kuei Chang-lin to win\\nthe girls over between them!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s expression changed abruptly: he was hearing\\nsomething “new” after all! However, after a moment’s thought\\nhe quickly pulled himself together and put on a serious expres-\\nsion, then banged his fist on the desk and shouted (though with-\\nout conviction):\\n\\n“I’m surprised at you, Wei-cheng! I’ve given Tu Wei-yueh full\\nauthority to manage the factory for me, and I don’t need any ad-\\n\\nvice from you!... What you\\'ve just told me is private, so don’t\\nbreathe a word of it outside! Understand? All right, you can\\ngo now.”\\n\\nHaving waved Wu Wei-cheng away, Wu Sun-fu picked up the\\nmemorandum he had been writing, glanced at it, then slowly\\ncrumpled it into a ball, hesitation and indecision written all over\\nhis face. All of a sudden, he leapt abruptly to his feet, smoothed\\nout the crumpled sheet of paper, and read it through once more;\\nthen, with a shake of the head and a snort, he tore it up and\\nthrew it into the spittoon. He had finally reversed his decision\\nnot to have his relatives in his own factory. He snatched up his\\npen again and began making out a notice:\\n\\nThe present reduction of wages has been dictated by the\\npressure of circumstances, and as soon as the price of silk\\nbegins to return to normal the original wage-scale will, of\\ncourse, come into force again. All employees are strongly\\nadvised to return to work without delay, and not allow\\nthemselves to be led astray by undesirable elements and so\\nget into trouble. For some time now, the management has\\n\\nborne with patience the continued feud between trade union\\nfactions. Let it be clearly understood that, in the event of\\nfurther attempts to sow dissension and foment unrest among\\nthe workers, the management will have no alternative but\\nto take drastic action.\\n\\nHaving given the notice to Mo Kan-cheng to put up, he left\\nthe office. Just as he was getting into his car, he turned round\\nto give Tu Wei-yueh his final warning:\\n\\n“T don’t care how you do it, I want the women back at work\\ntomorrow!”\\n\\nAt one o’clock in the afternoon, Tu Wei-yueh was pacing to\\nand fro in his office, now smiling grimly, now drawing his brows\\ntogether in a frown. The reason for this nervous anxiety was\\nthat he was now on the borderline of success and failure. That\\nmorning, when the strike had begun, he had been confident that\\nhe would win, for all the shouts of “Down with Chamber-pot\\nTu!” With the arrival of Wu Sun-fu on the scene, however, his\\nconfidence had given way to doubt. Even though Wu Sun-fu had\\nrepeatedly assured him that he was giving him an absolutely free\\nhand, he had not been slow to grasp the implication that the “free\\nhand” would only be his until “tomorrow.”\\n\\nIf he couldn’t bring the strike to an end the following morning,\\nthere would be no question of his fate—the sack!\\n\\nIt had been obvious to Tu Wei-yueh for some time that Wu\\nSun-fu had not been able to make up his mind from the very\\nbeginning. He was also fully aware of the difficulties involved\\nin working for a man who, like Wu Sun-fu, was normally ob-\\nstinate and ruthless, but who had given way to doubt and in-\\ndecision.\\n\\nSuddenly, a shadow flitted across the window. Tu Wei-yueh\\nat once stopped and went to see who it was, then hurried out.\\nIt was Kuei Chang-lin. The two men exchanged glances, but\\nsaid nothing, then walked together into Mo Kan-cheng’s office,\\nwhere they found several people, including Mo Kan-cheng, sitting\\nand waiting quietly.\\n\\nWith a rueful smile on his lips, Tu Wei-yueh glanced round\\nthe room and began:\\n\\n“Mr. Wu\\'s orders are that the women should go back to work\\ntomorrow without fail, which only leaves us this afternoon and\\nthis evening to arrange things. This morning we tried to get\\nthe women to send a representative to talk things over, but we\\ndidn’t have any luck. They refuse to recognize the existing trade\\nunion, and they’ve now set up a strike committee. I sent Kuei\\nChang-lin to negotiate with the strike committee, but they say\\nthey’re waiting for orders from the silk filatures general strike\\ncommittee. They’re just being bloody-minded about it! I don’t\\nthink we should concern ourselves with this so-called ‘general’\\nstrike committee, but get on with stopping the strike in this fac-\\ntory alone. The most important thing at the moment is to get\\nthem back to work tomorrow by hook or by crook! Even if we\\nonly get them working at half-pressure, it\\'ll be something to\\nshow to Mr. Wu. Chang-lin, do you think we\\'ll be able to get\\nthem back to work tomorrow? What actually is it that they’re\\ndemanding?”\\n\\nKuei Chang-lin did not reply at once. He glanced from Tu\\nWei-yueh to Mo Kan-cheng, then shook his head and sighed.\\n\\n“T give up! I’ve been run off my feet since yesterday evening\\ntrying to bring about a peaceful settlement and save people’s\\nface all round, then somebody goes running to the boss behind\\nmy back and turning him against me! You ask me to come\\nalong and give my opinion, Mr. Tu. If I don’t say what I think,\\npeople will say I’m being paid for doing nothing; if I do say what\\nI think, people will say that I’ve got an axe to grind or that I\\'m\\nhaving a go at somebody. Mr. Mo, don’t you see what an\\nawkward position I am in?”\\n\\nSilence fell upon the room. Tu Wei-yueh was frowning un-\\nhappily and gnawing his lips. Mo Kan-cheng looked flustered.\\nAh Chen, sitting in the corner, was smiling surreptitiously behind\\nher hand. She nudged Wang Chin-chen, who was sitting beside\\nher, and then threw Tu Wei-yueh a sidelong glance. They both\\nknew only too well what was upsetting Kuei Chang-lin. Pock-\\nmarked Li, however, was becoming impatient.\\n\\n“you’ve only got to give us the word, Mr. Tu, and we\\'ll go\\nstraight in and finish the job!”\\n\\n“phat’s right! put in Wang Chin-chen. “You\\'ve only got to\\ntell us what you want done, Mr. Tu! But, Chang-lin, let’s hear\\n\\nwhat it is you\\'ve got to say, so that we can decide what to do\\nabout it.”\\n\\nAs she said this she kept her eye on Mo Kan-cheng, who some-\\nhow knew what was coming. Tu Wei-yueh nodded slowly, look-\\ning first at Pockmarked Li and then towards Kuei Chang-lin.\\n\\n“All right, then,” the latter began hesitantly, “I\\'ll say what I\\nthink’s right. The girls know very well the boss is losing money.\\nThey also understand perfectly well what he said on the notice\\n-—he’s had to cut their wages because he’s not getting enough for\\nhis silk, and he’s going to reconsider later on. Now this strike’s\\nabout two things: it’s half because of that wage-cut and half be-\\ncause of certain people they don’t like. Hsueh Pao-chu’s too dom-\\nineering, and the girls hate her like poison. And then there’s\\nChien Chiao-lin and Chou Erh-chieh; they’re another thorn in\\neverybody\\'s side. If you want to make sure of getting the girls\\nback to work tomorrow, you\\'ll have to keep these three out of\\nthe way for a few days.”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Kuei Chang-lin looked steadily at Mo Kan-cheng’s\\nstartled face. Every now and then Tu Wei-yueh also ran his\\neye over Mo Kan-cheng’s face, and by the time Kuei Chang-lin\\nstopped, all eyes were turned to the old man. Mo Kan-cheng\\nfelt flustered, but did not lose his sense of proportion. He was\\nalways careful to steer a course between the two sides. He could\\nnot afford to risk being suspected of supporting the other side, so\\nhe hastened to ingratiate himself with this side.\\n\\n“Yes, you\\'re quite right!—Provided they do go back to work\\ntomorrow!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled sardonically, for he knew that this ex-\\nchange had paved the way nicely for him and that he could now\\nproceed, without any further delay, to give them the instructions\\nhe had already worked out in advance. His face became sud-\\ndenly grave as he raised his hand and motioned them to pay\\nattention.\\n\\n“We can’t afford to worry about how certain people are going\\nto take it,” he began grimly. “If we’ve found a way to get the\\ngirls back to work tomorrow, then it’s up to us all to do what’s\\nright and get on with it! Ah Chen, did you get in touch with\\nYao Chin-feng? Have you found out who’s on this strike com-\\n\\nmittee, or whatever it is, besides her? Which of the committee\\nmembers get on well with her?”\\n\\n“There\\'s no need to ask who the others are! Ho Hsiu-mei,\\nChang Ah-hsin and that crowd, of course! There’s two that I\\nknow of who’re on good terms with Yao Chin-feng: Hsu Ah-yi\\nand Lu Hsiao-pa2o.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, Ah Chen pouted out her lips and gave Tu Wei-\\nyueh a sidelong glance. The eternal flirt. Tu Wei-yueh sud-\\ndenly lost this temper.\\n\\n“You\\'re always bungling, Ah Chen! We must know exactly\\nwho these people on the strike committee are! Wang Chin-chen\\ncan help you. First you can tell Yao Chin-feng to round up Hsu\\nAh-yi and Lu Hsiao-pao, and tell them they\\'d better watch their\\nstep, because Ho Hsiu-mei and ail that bunch are Communists\\nand the police are going to arrest them! If the girls don’t turn\\nup at work tomorrow, Mr. Wu will be anything but gentle to\\nthem! If they’ve got any demands to make, they can do it after\\nthey’ve gone back to work. Then you can get all the forewomen\\ntogether and go round the huts in ones and twos and tell the girls\\nto call off the strike and not to be taken in by the agitators!”\\n\\n“But we can’t do that!” Wang Chin-chen and Ah Chen pro-\\ntested in unison. “Anybody who goes round the huts at a time\\nlike this is just asking for a good hiding!”\\n\\n“What are you afraid of?” Tu Wei-yueh snapped impatiently.\\n“You can always hit back, can’t you? I suppose you\\'ll be want-\\ning bodyguards next! All right, then: Li, you’d better call up\\nyour men to keep an eye on them.”\\n\\nAh Chen crimsoned and was going to argue, but Wang Chin-\\nchen tugged at her sleeve and stopped her. Ignoring the two\\ngirls, Tu Wei-yueh turned to Kuei Chang-lin:\\n\\n“What\\'s this so-called general strike committee they’ve got?\\nAnd who’s behind it pulling the strings?”\\n\\n“The Communists, of course! Just making the most of a chance\\nto stir up trouble! There’s over a hundred factories, big ones and\\nsmall ones, out on strike now in Hongkew and Chapei. They’ve\\ngot a general headquarters—in some hotel or other, so they say\\n—though I can find out all about it this evening.”\\n\\n“It\\'ll be too late by then! We must have the information this\\nafternoon! Though I’ve got another urgent job for you in the\\n\\nmeantime, Chang-lin. The girls are so sure of themselves only\\nbecause there are so many of them out on strike, and if the\\nstrikers in the other factories around don’t go back to work to-\\nmorrow, we’re going to have a job to persuade our girls here to\\ngo back. What I want you to do, Chang-lin, is to go round the\\nlocal factories and talk the managements into making tomorrow\\nthe deadline for the end of the strike. Tell them to use force\\nto make them go back, and get more policemen in! If there’s\\nany picketing at the gates, the pickets must be arrested!”\\n\\n“That’s the stuff!” broke in Pockmarked Li quickly, hearing\\nthat force was to be used. “That’s just what we ought to do at\\nthis place, Mr. Tu! I’ve just been waiting for a chance to stop\\ntheir little game once and for all!”\\n\\nHe slapped his thighs with his huge paws. He was a rough,\\nsimple-minded fellow, and he had been trying to puzzle out all\\nthe morning why Tu Wei-yueh would not use force. But for\\nhis “loyalty” to Tu Wei-yueh, he too would have joined in the\\nback-biting. Unable to contain himself any longer, he had stated\\nhis own view of the situation and now looked up as obediently\\nas ever into Tu Wei-yueh’s face.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh gazed back at Pockmarked Li with a faint smile\\n—it may have been a smile of sympathy, or it may have been\\none of approbation. Then he said to Pockmarked Li in a tone\\nof voice that was a mixture of coaxing and peremptoriness:\\n\\n“Don’t worry, Li, old chap. Sooner or later there’ll be plenty\\nof work for your fists, but don’t forget: a good fighter doesn’t\\nhave to get the first blow in! Besides, our factory\\'s different from\\nthe rest: there are so many difficulties involved that if we just\\nplunge in without getting a clear picture of the situation first,\\nwe\\'ll quite likely end up by making things worse than they are\\nnow. Mr. Wu\\'s always given us plenty of rope, so it’s up to us\\nto do things as he wants them done. See what I mean, Chang-\\nlin? Let our neighbour kill a chicken as a warning to our\\n\\nmonkey!”\\n“Just you leave it to me, and I’ll make a good job of it.”\\n“Good!... Now, Mr. Mo,” said Tu Wei-yueh grimly, turning\\n\\nabruptly to Mo Kan-cheng, “I’d like you to put up a notice straight\\naway dismissing Chien Chiao-lin, Hsueh Pao-chu, and Chou Erh-\\nchieh.”\\n\\nPockmarked Li and the two women were rather surprised\\nat this. They had hardly expected, when it had been suggested\\nthat these people should be “kept out of the way for a few days,”\\nthat they would be dismissed just like that. When they looked\\nat Tu Wei-yueh and saw the glint of firmness in his eyes, they\\nrealized that his decision was irrevocable. So that was the end\\nof Chien Pao-sheng and his bunch!\\n\\nIt had come as something of a shock to Mo Kan-cheng, as well.\\nHe looked at Tu Wei-yueh’s forbidding expression and said noth-\\ning for a moment. After a while he scratched uneasily at his\\ncheek and said hesitantly, “Couldn’t you save Hsueh Pao-chu’s\\nface a bit by asking Mr. Wu to transfer her to one of his ‘new’\\nfactories?”\\n\\n“That’s a matter for Mr. Wu\\'s kind-heartedness,” replied Tu\\nWei-yueh coldly. “It’s no concern of ours. All we’re concerned\\nwith here is putting up the dismissal notice!”\\n\\nHe turned from Mo Kan-cheng to the other four and went on\\ngrimly, “You all know that Hsueh Pao-chu and the other two\\nwere the first to stir up the girls against the wage-cut in the\\nworkshop yesterday afternoon. They’ve never tried to work con-\\nscientiously in this factory, and they seek every opportunity to\\nsettle their personal grievances by playing off the women against\\nKuei Chang-lin! But they’re such nasty pieces of work at the\\nbest of times that, however much they try to get round the girls,\\nthe girls will still hate the three of them like poison. If we’re\\nnow giving them the sack, it’s not because we want to gain any\\npersonal advantage: it’s because one, they\\'re trouble-makers, and\\ntwo, it’ll give the girls a chance to let off steam —once they’ve\\ngot rid of these three they\\'ll go back to work! Mr. Wu Sun-fu\\nwon\\'t let me resign, so I\\'ll have to carry on—though it\\'ll mean\\nI’m going to upset some people. I hope I can rely on you people\\nto give me your full support, so that we can get everything prop-\\nerly arranged tonight to ensure that the girls go back to work\\ntomorrow without any fuss or trouble. — Though once they’re\\nback I’m going to hand in my resignation once more!”\\n\\nMo Kan-cheng and the others exchanged surreptitious glances,\\nbut no one said anything.\\n\\n“We haven\\'t a moment to lose,” said Tu Wei-yueh, then sternly\\ngave his final order: “Right! All of you go and put your backs\\n\\ninto it and report back to me by five o’clock!... Li, P’ve got an-\\nother job for you.” He signed to Pockmarked Li to follow him\\nand left the room. The latter made a grimace at the two women\\nand gleefully hurried out behind Tu Wei-yueh.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh stopped when he got to the end of the veranda\\nwhich ran along the front of the office buildings. Pockmarked Li\\nhurried up and stood in front of him, his lips parted in an elated\\ngrin to reveal his large teeth. Part of Tu Wei-yueh’s face was\\nin the sun and showed smooth and shiny while the rest of it was\\nin shadow and had a rather pallid appearance. He tilted his head\\nin thought for a moment, then turned his keen eyes on Pock-\\nmarked Li and asked in a whisper:\\n\\n“Haven’t you found anything out yet, tailing them all this\\ntime?”\\n\\n“No, not yet. The only people those two have had any con-\\ntact with are other girls from the factory. We\\'ve kept tabs on\\nboth of them, but they never went outside the slum.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean to say they know they’re being shadowed?”\\n\\n“No fear of that! All my blokes are old hands at the game:\\nyou wouldn’t find them giving themselves away!”\\n\\n“Any strangers been seen?”\\n\\n“No. The only people that Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin\\never see are girls from the factory.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh cast another sharp glance at Pockmarked Li, then\\ntilted his head on one side and closed one eye. He was fairly\\ncertain in his own mind that Pockmarked Li’s men were too\\nstupid and clumsy not to have given themselves away. He had\\nlong been aware that Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin had some-\\nthing up their sleeves, He slewed his eyes round to Pockmarked\\nLi again and went on:\\n\\n“Who was with them when they left Yao Chin-feng’s hut last\\nnight?”\\n\\n“Er—last night? Well, Ho Hsiu-mei and Lu Hsiao-pao were\\nwalking along together quarrelling. Chang Ah-hsin went off\\nwith two other girls and before they’d gone very far they split\\nup and went three different ways.”\\n\\n“And what about the other two—were they from the factory?\\nDo you know their names?”\\n\\n“They were factory girls all right. They’d just been to the\\nmeeting at Yao Chin-feng’s place. I didn’t see them myself, but\\nsome of my men did. One of them was of middling height, round\\nface, bright eyes, darkish skin. The other one was a bit taller,\\nbut they didn’t remember exactly what she looked like.”\\n\\nA cold smile suddenly appeared on Tu Wei-yueh’s lips. Round\\nface, bright eyes, darkish skin, of medium height: he knew who\\nthat was.\\n\\n“Did they talk on the way?”\\n\\n“Didn’t I just say: they split up before they’d gone very far.\\nThe three of them were walking along arm in arm like the best\\nof friends.”\\n\\nPockmarked Li seemed to be getting impatient. He wiped his\\nmouth with the back of his hand and looked at Tu Wei-yueh with\\nstaring eyes.\\n\\nA shadow flitted across the corner of the wall, Tu Wei-yueh’s\\nsharp eyes had not missed it, and he at once stepped forward to\\nsee who it was. It was Ah Hsiang, a new “recruit” to whom Tu\\nWei-yueh had not yet entrusted any important mission. When\\nhe saw Tu Wei-yueh, he stopped. Tu Wei-yueh frowned briefly,\\nthen called out to him:\\n\\n“Ah Hsiang! All the forewomen have gone down to the huts\\nto persuade the girls to go back to work tomorrow, because Mr.\\nWu’s put up a notice promising to talk things over with them\\nonce they’ve gone back. I want you to go and keep your eye\\non them and see that all of the forewomen have gone down. If\\nyou find that any of them haven’t gone, come back and report\\nthem to me.”\\n\\n“Tf there’s any trouble, let them have it,” added Pockmarked\\nLi. “Just shout if you want any help! We\\'ve got the whole\\nplace surrounded!” He opened his mouth wide and laughed. Tu\\nWei-yueh smiled briefly, but his expression immediately became\\nserious again as he turned back to Pockmarked Li:\\n\\n“We\\'re going down there, too—to look for somebody. I want\\nhalf a dozen of your chaps to go with us.”\\n\\nNow that he was quite sure that the dark-skinned, good-looking\\nChu Kuei-ying was mixed up in the plot, Tu Wei-yueh had de-\\ncided to go and investigate in person.\\n\\nAs they made their way down to the slum, they found the\\nwhole area alive with policemen and militiamen patrolling in\\npairs, while small knots of factory girls buzzed excitedly by the\\nroadside. Their faces shiny with perspiration in the broiling sun,\\nthey swarmed noisily up and down, fearless and excited. As\\nthey neared the slum, they felt a growing tension in the air. The\\ngirls were swarming and humming like mosquitoes at dusk.\\nThey were discussing the dismissal of the three girls from the\\nfactory. A voice rang out clear above the din: “No mention\\nof the twenty per cent wage-cut? They’re trying to diddle us!”\\n\\nWith Pockmarked Li and his bullies in tow, Tu Wei-yueh now\\nentered the slum. His lips were set in his usual sardonic smile,\\nbut his face was pale and he could feel countless hostile eyes\\nwatching him from all sides. “Look, the Chamber-pot!” “Let\\'s\\nget him!” The voices were subdued and sporadic at first, but\\nthey became louder and louder as more girls took up thecry. Tu\\nWei-yueh cast a furtive glance at Pockmarked Li and saw that\\nhis face was dark and his jaw set firm.\\n\\nThe bullies were now moving about in twos and threes among\\nthe knots of girls, looking for all the world like so many black\\nbeetles in their black gowns or black silk jackets. These hench-\\nmen of Pockmarked Li’s were deliberately barging into the cat-\\ncalling groups of girls and clawing at their breasts through their\\ntight, sweat-soaked jackets. Every now and then there would be\\na little skirmish and shouts would be exchanged, but in a few\\nseconds it would be over. The girls were trying not to be in-\\nvolved in a full-blooded fight with the bullies, and the latter\\nwere holding their fire until they received the order to lash out\\nin earnest.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh kept his head down and hurried on, while Pock-\\nmarked Li led him to Chu Kuei-ying’s hut.\\n\\n“Look out! Chamber-pot Tu’s coming to get us!”\\n\\nThe sudden shout came from the doorway of a hut. The next\\nmoment a little girl darted out. It was Chin Hsiao-mei, the little\\nfactory-hand who lived in the next hut to Chu Kuei-ying. Pock-\\nmarked Li snorted angrily and rushed forward to grab her with\\nhis rough, grimy paw, but she was too nimble for him: she\\nducked and dodged out of the way, then ran for dear life.\\nTu Wei-yueh signed to Pockmarked Li not to pursue her, and\\n\\nthe two of them turned and charged into Chu Kuei-ying’s hut,\\nleaving the bullies outside to keep watch.\\n\\nWhen Tu Wei-yueh’s eyes had got accustomed to the gloom\\ninside the hut, he saw Chu Kuei-ying standing in front of him,\\nher blazing eyes riveted on his. Her oval, olive-skinned face\\nwas suffused with anger and her little lips were bloodless. There\\nwere only the three of them in the hut: Chu Kuei-ying, Pock-\\nmarked Li and Tu Wei-yueh. For a moment there was a tense\\nsilence, while outside the hut a babel of voices was gradually\\nrising like a tide, louder and louder.\\n\\nForcing a smile, Tu Wei-yueh broke the silence. “Chu Kuei-\\nying, it’s been reported to me that you’re a Communist. There\\nare two ways open to you, and it’s up to you to choose: either\\nyou tell me about the other Communists you go with, in which\\ncase you\\'ll be promoted forewoman, or else you don’t tell me,\\nin which case you\\'ll go to jail.”\\n\\n“I’m not a Communist and I don’t know any Communists!”\\n\\n“Ah, but I know all about it, you see! Besides you there’s\\nHo Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin....”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying’s heart missed a beat, and a slight change came\\nover her face. Tu Wei-yueh saw it quite clearly. He smiled\\nand pressed her further. “And now you\\'re going to tell me who\\nelse there is besides those two!”\\n\\n“J tell you I don’t know any Communists. You can take me\\nto the police station if you like, but I\\'ll still say the same thing!”\\n\\nChu Kuei-ying’s expression was a little calmer now, though her\\nlips were paler still and her bright eyes were ablaze. Tu Wei-\\nyueh gave a derisive snort, then suddenly swung round to Pock-\\nmarked Li and rasped:\\n\\n“Search the house!”\\n\\nBy now the sound of angry voices outside had become louder\\nstill. A din of shouting and cursing suddenly broke out, then\\nstopped abruptly, only to be replaced by the swish and thud of\\nbamboo and wood on human flesh, voices snarling through\\nclenched teeth, blood-curdling howls, and a sudden rush of feet.\\nThen, unexpectedly, a roar of triumph as a crowd of angry\\nwomen burst into the hut and hurled themselves straight at\\nTu Wei-yueh and Pockmarked Li. In the ensuing silent scuffle\\n\\nin the darkness of the hut the plank table and the rickety bamboo\\nbedstead were both overturned.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh wielded a bench as he fought his way out\\nthrough the tangle of bodies, but just as he got to the door a\\nsecond wave burst into the hut and cut off his retreat. The din\\nfrom the crowd outside was deafening. Tu Wei-yueh was now\\nwrestling frantically with two of the girls. In the confusion he\\ncaught a clear glimpse of one of them: it was Chang Ah-hsin.\\nAll of a sudden Pockmarked Li grabbed hold of a girl in both\\nhands and used her as a battering-ram to clear a way through\\nto Tu Wei-yueh. The girls surrounding Tu Wei-yueh abandoned\\nhim and turned their attention to Pockmarked Li. Tu Wei-\\nyueh saw his chance to escape and dashed out of the hut only\\nto be caught up in another crowd. Fortunately for him, these\\nwere not infuriated girls, but a dozen or so of Pockmarked Li’s\\nbullies fleeing before a veritable deluge of women close on their\\nheels. When they reached the narrow street running alongside\\nthe slum, the girls caught up with the bullies and another rough-\\nand-tumble broke out. The shrill screech of police-whistles sud-\\ndenly pierced through the din and the white of police cap-bands\\nmingled with the girls’ flying hair.\\n\\nBang! Bang! Warning shots passed over the heads of the\\ncrowd.\\n\\nPockmarked Li had also escaped from the hut, and still had\\nhold of the same girl. He smirked at Tu Wei-yueh.\\n\\nBd\\n\\nTen minutes later all was quiet again in the vicinity of Chu\\nKuei-ying’s hut. The muddy ground was littered with splinters\\nof bamboo, and in the middle lay a night-stool brush which had\\nbeen used as a weapon. The bamboo door of the hut had been\\ndamaged and now hung askew like the broken wing of a bird.\\nDown at the east end of the slum, however, a noisy crowd had\\ngathered on a rubbish dump: the girls were holding a meeting.\\nWhat few policemen there were, were watching from a safe\\ndistance. Half a dozen or more of Pockmarked Li’s henchmen\\nstood scattered around the policemen.\\n\\nThe meeting had been called on the spur of the moment and\\nwas over in no time at all. It had been called just in time to\\n\\ncatch the women’s will to fight at its zenith, Tu Wei-yueh’s\\nswoop on the slum soon had its effect on the struggle among the\\nwomen themselves.\\n\\n“Chamber-pot Tu’s a twister!” shrilled Chang Ah-hsin. She\\nwas addressing the meeting from the top of a rubbish-heap and\\ngesticulating wildly. “He only gave Hsueh Pao-chu and the\\nother two the sack so that he can trick us into going back to\\nwork! Hsueh Pao-chu and the other two girls have been going\\nagainst him, so he has to find an excuse to get rid of them! And\\nthen he comes down here with Pockmarked Li to round us up!\\nDown with Chamber-pot Tu, I say! No going back tomorrow!\\nAnybody who goes back’s a rat!”\\n\\nA thunderous roar broke from the crowd at this:\\n\\n“Anybody who goes back’s a rat!”\\n\\n“Anybody who tries to get us to go back is a rat, too!”\\n\\n“Give Yao Chin-feng a good hiding! She\\'s a rat!”\\n\\n“If they cut down our wages, we’d rather die than go back!”\\ncontinued Chang Ah-hsin. “We demand that Chamber-pot Tu\\nbe slung out! And Kuei Chang-lin with him! Get rid of Wang\\nChin-chen, Pockmarked Li, Ah Chen, and Yao Chin-feng, and\\nbring back Ho Hsiu-mei! We want,...”\\n\\nShe stopped, too hoarse to shout any more. Suddenly, she\\nclapped her hands to her stomach and doubled up, then sank\\non to her haunches. Immediately, another girl sprang up to\\ntake her place. It was Chen Yueh-ngo. She had two bloody\\nweals across her face from when she had fought with Tu Wei-\\nyueh. In a voice which was even louder than Chang Ah-hsin’s\\nhad been, she shouted:\\n\\n“We must reorganize the strike committee! We must throw out\\nYao Chin-feng, Hsu Ah-yi, and Lu Hsiao-pao from the committee!\\nThey want us to go back tomorrow, so we should throw them\\nout neck and crop!”\\n\\n“Chuck ’em out!” was the ear-splitting reply from the crowd.\\nSuddenly, Chang Ah-hsin leapt to her feet, her face suffused\\nwith a dark flush, and shrilled at the top of her voice:\\n\\n“We mustn’t go back until the general strike committee tells\\nus to! Now listen, girls! A representative of the general strike\\ncommittee has got something to say to you!”\\n\\nA sudden silence fell upon the crowd. A representative of\\nthe general strike committee? Who was it? Where was she?\\nThe women’s faces, bathed in sweat and flushed with excite-\\nment, turned from side to side as they craned and peered to\\nsee who it was, and a hum of conversation rose from the crowd.\\nAfter a moment, a young woman dressed like a factory girl,\\nwith large eloquent eyes, scrambled up on to the rubbish-heap\\nand stood between Chang Ah-hsin and Chen Yueh-ngo. It was\\nMa Chin.\\n\\n“Sisters! A hundred and two silk factories in Shanghai are\\nout on strike together! It was you who were brave enough to\\ngive the lead! The rats and blacklegs in your factory may fight\\namong themselves, but they’re still united when it comes to\\noppressing you and swindling you! The only way you can achieve\\nvictory is to rely on your own strength alone! Throw out the\\nrats and blacklegs, and organize your own trade union! And\\ndon’t go back till the general strike committee tells you!”\\n\\n“No going back till we’re told!” shouted Chang Ah-hsin and\\nChen Yueh-ngo, giving the crowd a slogan.\\n\\n“No going back till we’re told!” echoed the closely-packed ranks\\nof the crowd. It was almost literally an echo, in fact. Although\\nMa Chin had done her best to “purge” her speech of formulas\\nand jargon, it was still an “intellectual\\'s” speech and so it had\\nnot made an immediate appeal to the girls’ hearts.\\n\\n“Don’t forget, girls!” shouted Chen Yueh-ngo. “We\\'ve got to\\nstick together! No going back! No going back!... Meeting\\nclosed!\"\\n\\nSo saying, she jumped down from the rubbish-heap, followed\\nby Chang Ah-hsin and Ma Chin. The crowd broke up and\\ndrifted away, shouting slogans as they went. Before long, a\\nsquad of armed policemen on motorcycles arrived from the\\npolice station, followed by a large force of foot police, but the\\ngirls had already dispersed and all they found was an empty\\nrubbish dump. All the police could do was to post a guard over\\nit to stop the girls holding another meeting there. The Chinese\\nsection of Shanghai had been under martial law for the last\\nMonth, and meetings were absolutely prohibited.\\n\\nok\\n\\nYao Chin-feng and Ah Chen had already scurried back to the\\nfactory to give Tu Wei-yueh a detailed report of the meeting.\\nThey ended by clamouring for protection.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh frowned, but said nothing. He had never ex-\\npected that, after all the trouble he had taken to cultivate these\\ncontacts among the women, they would now prove useless. He\\nhad once thought that he would not have to devote more than a\\nthird of his energies to dealing with the girls, but he realized now\\nthat he would have to devote his last ounce of energy to dealing\\nwith them.\\n\\n“Miserable, scatter-brained creatures!” he muttered viciously to\\nhimself through clenched teeth. ‘Seems a good hiding’s all they\\'ll\\nunderstand! I’ll give them ‘Chamber-pot Tu’!”\\n\\nWith this he left the two girls and went through into the front\\noffice. He was met by an agitated Mo Kan-cheng, who button-\\nholed him and stammered excitedly:\\n\\n“1... I say, Wei-yueh! I was j—just looking for you! Mr.\\nWu\\'s been on the phone and he’s in a—a terrible rage! Will\\nthey ... will they go back to work tomorrow, after all? D’you\\n\\nthink they will?”\\n\\n“Pm sure they will!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh was as resolute and confident as ever, and a\\ncool smile played around his lps. Mo Kan-cheng half closed\\none eye and gave him a puzzled look.\\n\\n“Mr, Wu’s coming over straight away.”\\n\\n“what for?” asked Tu Wei-yueh in a low voice, shrugging\\nhis shoulders, then quickly put on a grim look and roared:\\n\\n“what the hell’s happened to Wang Chin-chen and the rest\\nof the useless crew? You can never find them when you want\\nthem! Send somebody out to look for them, Mr. Mo, When\\nthey come, tell them to wait for me in your office. And please\\nbe quick about it!”\\n\\nSo saying, Tu Wei-yueh stalked quickly away before Mo Kan-\\ncheng could get another word in. He went first to the main gate\\nto see how things were there. The iron gate was closed fast and\\nfour policemen stood on guard. Pockmarked Li and his bullies\\nwere roving about the place. Some of them were squatting on\\nthe steps in front of the cocoon-store, looking like defeated game-\\ncocks. When he saw Tu Wei-yueh, Pockmarked Li hurried across\\n\\nto him and said quietly, “Chien Pao-sheng’s lot were in that\\nfight just now. Did you know?”\\n\\n“How do you know?”\\n\\n“Ah Hsiang told me.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh gave a derisive snort, narrowed his eyes at the\\nsky for a moment, then looked back at Pockmarked Li again.\\n“Now [li need fifty men. Go and round them up straight away,\\nLi, and have them wait here till I tell you what to do.”\\n\\nLeaving the main gate, Tu Wei-yueh walked off to inspect the\\nside gates and the rear gate. By this time he had made up\\nhis mind what he was going to do, and now headed back towards\\nthe office. When he got there, he found Wu Wei-cheng, Ma\\nChing-shan and Tseng Chia-chu whispering together on the\\nveranda. He gave them a casual glance, then suddenly changed\\ndirection, slipped round the back of the office buildings, and made\\nhis way to a waste-store next to the boiler-house. He went in.\\n\\nSquatting on the floor, her hands tied behind her back, was\\nHo Hsiu-mei. When she saw that it was Tu Wei-yueh, she quickly\\naverted her face and jerked herself furiously round away from\\nhim.\\n\\nHe smiled sardonically and began looking her carefully up and\\ndown. For a while he remained perfectly quiet and said nothing.\\nSuddenly, Ho Hsiu-mei cast a furtive glance over her shoulder\\nas if to see whether he was still there or not. As it happened,\\nher eyes immediately met his, still cold and hard. Unable to\\nrestrain himself, Tu Wei-yueh burst out laughing.\\n\\n“Ho Hsiu-mei,” he said. “Just wait patiently a little longer.\\nAfter six o’clock, when we\\'ve finished discussing terms with\\nyour representatives, we\\'ll let you go.”\\n\\nHo Hsiu-mei started at him in silence. This time she did not\\nturn her head away.\\n\\n“The representatives are Lu Hsiao-pao, Yao Chin-feng, and\\nsomebody else...a friend of yours...Chang Ah-hsin!”\\n\\nHo Hsiu-mei gave a start and a look of surprise came into her\\nface. She continued to stare at Tu Wei-yueh, as if waiting for\\nhim to go on.\\n\\n“Now Chang Ah-hsin knows which side her bread is buttered.\\nI’ve had a sincere, heart-to-heart talk with her, and now she’s\\ncome to see sense. She was quite frank with me, and she’s told\\n\\nme everything. You\\'ve got a good, loyal friend there. She gave\\nme her word that you’re a good girl, really, but she says you\\'re\\nyoung and don’t know any better, so that you’ve played into the\\nCommunists’ hands. That’s right, isn’t it?”\\n\\nHo Hsiu-mei gave a frightened yelp and her face turned deathly\\npale. Her terrified eyes were riveted on Tu Wei-yueh’s.\\n\\n“And then there are the other girls in your little group. They’re\\nall good friends of yours, your ‘comrades,’ aren’t they? Yes,\\nChang Ah-hsin told me all about it! But don’t worry, I’m not\\nyoing to have them arrested. I’ve always got on very well with\\nyou girls! Ill tell you what, though: if the police ever find\\nout you’re in with the Communists, you\\'ll be arrested and shot.\\nNow just think, Ho Hsiu-mei: some of your friends must be\\nsensible girls that we can talk round. If you can think of any,\\nI\\'ll be only too willing to help them out.”\\n\\n“Oh, Ah-hsin! Ah-hsin!”\\n\\nHo Hsiu-mei shuddered as she moaned these words, then let\\nher head slump forward, heart-broken. Tu Wei-yueh gnawed at\\nhis lip and smiled, then stepped forward, bent over her, and\\nbegan in what sounded like a thoroughly sincere tone of voice:\\n\\n“you shouldn’t blame Ah-hsin! Don’t blame her! If you just\\nstop and think about for a moment, you\\'ll understand what it’s\\nall about. Look at the many strikes in Shanghai: they were all\\nstarted by Communists. But who goes to prison in the end?\\nYou workers, of course. Meanwhile, the Communists themselves\\nare sitting pretty and taking things easy in their big, modern\\nhouses. Every time you go on strike, they put in a nice big claim\\nfor expenses and go and have a good time on the proceeds. Take\\nthat girl student, for instance—the one that’s been leading you\\nand Chang Ah-hsin on. Now you never knew where she lived,\\ndid you? I\\'ll tell you: she lives in a big luxurious modern house!\\nThough when she comes to a meeting, she has to change into\\nshabby old clothes. And every time she comes over here for a\\nmeeting she gets ten or twenty dollars for her fare, whereas\\nyou girls have to go on your two feet! She lives in this big,\\nmodern house and even her maids are better off than you girls\\nwill ever be! Chang Ah-hsin ran into her one day and found out\\nwhat she was really like. So what did she do? Slipped Ah-hsin\\na five-dollar note and told her to keep her mouth shut! Though\\n\\nhasn’t Ah-hsin told you all about this herself? She’s not being\\nquite honest with you if she hasn’t. However, she’s been a very\\ngood friend to you, and she swears you\\'re all right!”\\n\\nHo Hsiu-mei hung her head in silence. Suddenly, she burst out\\ncrying. It was like a little child crying. Then, abruptly, she\\nforced herself to stop and raised her tear-stained face to look at\\nTu Wei-yueh. She stared and stared, and all the time the corners\\nof her mouth twitched, as if she was torn by some inner conflict\\nwhich she could not resolve. Noticing the twitching of her lips,\\nand realizing what it meant, Tu Wei-yueh put on as sympathetic\\nan expression as he could, and pressed home his advantage.\\n\\n“Don\\'t worry, Ho Hsiu-mei! It won’t be long now before we\\nlet you go home. Now that we’ve dismissed Hsueh Pao-chu,\\nwe need another girl to take her place. I’m thinking of recom-\\nmending you to Mr. Wu for promotion to forewoman. Then\\nwe\\'ll all get on very well together, with no more quarrels, and\\neverything’ll be all right!”\\n\\nHo Hsiu-mei’s face crimsoned, and tears suddenly started from\\nher eyes, though her sobbing had stopped.\\n\\n“But Hsiu-mei, can’t you think of any of your friends who\\nwould listen to good advice? Now think hard, and we\\'ll go and\\ntalk them round.”\\n\\nHo Hsiu-mei suddenly went in to a trance. Her head bent in\\nthought, she mechanically twisted the tail of her jacket between\\nher fingers. After a moment she sighed and murmured: “You\\'ll\\nhave to ask Chang Ah-hsin. She knows more about it than I\\ndo.”\\n\\nIt was all she cculd find to say. She hung her head again and\\ntrembled slightly. When he saw that he would not get anything\\nout of her, Tu Wei-yueh shrugged his shoulders, inwardly despis-\\ning this useless Communist. With a contemptuous glance at her,\\nhe turned on his heel and stalked out. His spirits were buoyant\\nas he walked back to the office. He found Ah Hsiang standing\\nidle in front of the veranda and gave him a job:\\n\\n“Ah Hsiang, go down to the huts and persuade Chang Ah-hsin\\nto come up here with you. If you can’t coax her, bring her by\\nforce. And be as quick as you can about it.”\\n\\nJust then, a car drove into the factory. Wu Sun-fu’s bodyguard\\nKuan jumped out and held the door open, and Wu Sun-fu himself\\n\\nclambered out. Seeing Tu Wei-yueh coming across to meet him,\\nhe said:\\n\\n“Things are getting worse and worse! I just don’t see how you\\ncan ever get them back to work tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Mr. Wu,” said Tu Wei-yueh with a bow, “the night is some-\\ntimes darkest just before daybreak—no stars, no moon.” His\\nvoice was perfectly calm and confident. Wu Sun-fu forced a\\nbrief smile and began pacing along the cinder path on which\\nhis car was parked. After he had gone a few steps he swung\\nround to Tu Wei-yueh, who was following him.\\n\\n“So you\\'re sure about it, eh? All right, then perhaps you\\'ll\\njust tell me how you\\'re going to go about it?”\\n\\nHis voice was just a little too genial, and Tu Wei-yueh suddenly\\nfelt uneasy. He was afraid this might be the prelude to an\\nunpleasant scene. After a moment’s hesitation, he ran briefly\\nthrough the principal developments to date; as he spoke, he\\nscanned Wu Sun-fu’s face carefully. The light of the low,\\nwestering sun lit up one side of Wu Sun-fu’s face, so that it ap-\\npeared shiny and colourful by contrast with the other side, which\\nwas in shadow. The antithesis of light and shade might have\\nbeen symbolic of the two sides of his character. Tu Wei-yueh\\nrelaxed a little now and gazed up at the eastern sky, where\\nvast heaps of flaming cloud hung over the horizon.\\n\\n“So the girl you’ve caught, this Ho—er—Ho Hsiu-mei, is going\\nto be released, then, eh?”\\n\\n‘Not till it gets dark, and when she is released she\\'ll be\\nshadowed. I think we\\'ll be able to net the whole bunch of them\\nthis time.” The shadow of a smile flickered round his lips as\\nhe said this.\\n\\n“All right, do it your way and we\\'ll see what happens. In\\nthe meantime, Wei-yueh, make an announcement that tomorrow’s\\nthe deadline for the end of the strike! Those who don’t go\\nback tomorrow will be sacked!”\\n\\nSuddenly, Wu Sun-fu was seized with a fit of exasperation.\\nWithout waiting for Tu Wei-yueh’s reply, he scrambled back\\ninto the car. His bodyguard settled himself in beside the chauf-\\nfeur, and the car moved slowly off. The big iron gates were\\nswung right back to let it through, while Pockmarked Li super-\\nvised the operation in stentorian tones. The car had only got\\n\\nhalf way through the gates, when a great roar went up outside,\\nand a crowd of girls surged forward and blocked its path.\\nImmediately, the whole area of the main gate was thrown into\\nconfusion. The policemen, followed by Pockmarked Li and _ his\\nbullies, came rushing up to clear the way, but all the time more\\nand more girls came flocking in until the crowd was twice, three\\ntimes, four times, five times its original size. The road outside\\nthe gate was now completely blocked and there was no hope of\\never getting the car through. Inside the car, Wu Sun-fu’s heart\\nwas pounding violently.\\n\\n“Let Ho Hsiu-mei go, and we\\'ll let you go!” shouted the girls,\\nas they burst through the cordon of policemen and bullies and\\nmade straight for the car. They were quite unarmed, but their\\ndetermined onslaught made them more terrifying than if they\\nhad been armed to the teeth.\\n\\nThe bodyguard, Kuan, leapt out on to the running-board of\\nthe car with a murderous expression on his face and pulled\\nout his gun, The girls did not budge. Then, from the back of\\nthe crowd, stones and clods began sailing over, though they went\\nwide of the mark. The girls were providing themselves with\\nweapons now, but apparently they had no serious intention of\\nstarting a full-scale battle. Sitting in his car, his face livid, Wu\\nSun-fu shouted repeatedly at the chauffeur:\\n\\n“Drive on! Straight through ’em at full speed!”\\n\\nThe chauffeur was hard put to it. He tried sounding the horn.\\nThis had a slight effect, for it made the girls immediately in\\nfront of the car step back instinctively. The car began to move,\\nbut the girls would not retreat another step. Angry shouts\\nwent up and a hail of stones and clods came flying over from\\nthe back of the crowd, this time hitting the car. Kuan gave a\\nroar of fury, raised his gun, and aimed into the middle of the\\ncrowd. Just then, someone burst through from behind him. An\\narm flashed out and the bodyguard’s arm was knocked up in the\\nair, At the same moment the gun went off and the shot went\\nskywards.\\n\\nIt was Tu Wei-yueh. Turning away from the bodyguard, he\\nbellowed at the chauffeur:\\n\\n“You idiot! Back out and turn the ear round!”\\n\\nThe car backed in through the gates again, this time without\\na warning blare from the horn. Wu Sun-fu sprawled back in\\nhis seat and showed his teeth in a derisive grin. The chauffeur\\nquickly turned the car round, then drove back along the cinder\\npath and out through the back gate. Meanwhile, part of the\\ncrowd had poured in through the gateway, but the greater part\\nof the crowd had been held back outside. Inside and out all\\nwas confusion and turmoil, but the girls had no definite aim\\nnow. The main body of the crowd was soon dispersed by the\\npolice, while the few dozen girls inside were forcibly ejected\\nby Pockmarked Li and his bullies.\\n\\nAs darkness gradually fell the wind rose again. Everywhere\\nwas quiet again around the factory, but the atmosphere was still\\ntense and everyone was on edge. Extra sentries had been put\\non the main gate. The general office was packed; all the fore-\\nwomen were there, including Wang Chin-chen and Ah Chen,\\nnoisily discussing the incident at the gate. The fifty-odd men\\nbrought along by Pockmarked Li were waiting for orders on or\\nnear the veranda. With the day gone, and only one night left,\\neveryone had given up hope of getting the girls back to work\\nthe next day. Yet when they saw that Tu Wei-yueh was as\\nconfident as ever, and heard his firm, calm voice, their doubts\\nquickly vanished.\\n\\n“Right, we\\'ve got to get cracking!” he said, addressing the fore-\\nwomen. “You\\'ve got a night’s work ahead of you yet! Now\\nget down to the huts and get a grip of the girls! Tell them that\\nanybody who doesn’t go back tomorrow will be sacked! If none\\nof them comes back, Mr. Wu will close down the factory! And\\nif they come kicking up a row at the gate again, the whole lot\\nof them will be run inside! If they go back tomorrow without\\nany fuss, we’re prepared to discuss things with them afterwards.\\nNow, get cracking and put your backs into it! There\\'ll be some-\\nbody down there to make sure you do the job properly!”\\n\\nNone of the forewomen dared to utter a word; they just looked\\nfurtively at each other and pulled long faces.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh now called Pockmarked Li in and gave him his\\norders:\\n\\n“Got all your men here, Li? They’ve got a hard night\\'s work\\nin front of them, though it’s only for one night. Tell them to\\n\\nsplit up into twos and threes and patrol all round the huts. If\\nthey see any girls getting together, tell them to charge straight\\nin and do what they like with them. If fists are needed, don’t\\nhesitate to use them! If they find the girls holding a meeting in\\nany of the huts, tell them to force their way in and round up as\\nmany as they can of them. If they see any girls walking about\\noutside, they’re to shadow them, whoever they are. Got it?\\nRight, here’s two hundred dollars. Share it out among your\\nmen.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh threw a roll of notes on the table in front of\\nPockmarked Li, then looked all round and bellowed, ‘Where\\'s\\nAh Hsiang? I suppose you’ve brought Chang Ah-hsin along?”\\n\\nAh Hsiang squeezed through from behind the forewomen,\\nlooking very down in the mouth. Tu Wei-yueh’s face immediately\\ndarkened.\\n\\n“I\\'ve hunted everywhere but I still can’t find her,” said Ah\\nHsiang, reddening. “I can’t think where she can be hiding.\\nBitch! I’ll go and have another look for her.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he stole a glance at Pockmarked Li, as if he hoped\\nthat he would put in a good word for him. Tu Wei-yueh turned\\naway from him with a snort and addressed the room at large:\\n\\n“Did you all hear that? One of the perishers has already gone\\ninto hiding! — Now, look here, Ah Hsiang! You’ve made a muck-\\nup of it and let one of the ringleaders escape! There’s no point\\nin going down to have another look for her. Hang on here a\\nminute; I’ve got another job for you.”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh stood up as he said this, and waved to the fore-\\nwomen and Pockmarked Li to leave the room. Only Ah Hsiang\\nremained behind, looking very uncomfortable as he waited for\\nhis orders.\\n\\nIt was already quite dark outside, and the cawing of crows\\ncame from the roof of the workshop opposite. Tu Wei-yueh\\nstared intently at Ah Hsiang, as if to make sure whether this\\nyoung man was capable of assuming a heavy responsibility. At\\nlength, he made up his mind and fixed his gimlet eyes on Ah\\nHsiang’s.\\n\\n“When we let Ho Hsiu-mei go, I want you to shadow her. And\\nmake sure you don’t slip up this time!”\\n\\nHaving now disposed his forces, he rang up the local police\\nstation and asked them to send up extra policemen to guard the\\nfactory.\\n\\n2k\\n\\nAround nine o’clock that evening, Wu Sun-fu was entertaining\\na number of friends and relatives who had come to see how he\\nwas after his unpleasant experience at the factory gate. The\\nhouse and garden were ablaze with lights, and the whir of electric\\nfans was everywhere. It was the same old “bright and happy”\\nworld as ever.\\n\\nMrs. Wu and her sister Pei-shan and Mrs. Tu and her sister\\nHuei-fang were playing mahjong in the dining-room, while Wu\\nSun-fu was entertaining his guests (including Colonel Lei, who\\nhad just returned to Shanghai from the front) in the large\\ndrawing-room, and chatting about the wave of strikes which had\\nbeen sweeping Shanghai for the past two months. It was an\\ninformal conversation, but their laughter sounded rather forced.\\nWu Sun-fu felt as if his mind was being tugged outwards in\\nhalf a dozen directions at once, and try as he might, he just\\ncould not concentrate for two moments together. His unruly\\nstate of mind showed in his face, which was now dark, now\\nflushed, now pale.\\n\\nPresently, an awkward silence fell over the room, broken only\\nby the drowsy whir of the electric fan, like some monotonous\\nlullaby. From the dining-room came the clatter of mahjong-\\ntiles and the sound of Ah-hsuan’s laughter. After a moment,\\ntwo men came into the room, arguing as they went: Tu Hsueh-\\nshih and his nephew, Tu Hsin-to.\\n\\n“what do you mean my theory is mere fantasy which won\\'t\\nwork in practice?” Tu Hsueh-shih was protesting. “What about\\nyours? Have you ever run a factory? All you can do is lie in\\nbed and dream about doing things!”\\n\\nHe was furious, and his cat-like eyes now stared like those of a\\nstartled hare. Though he was actually three or four years\\nyounger than his nephew, and though he was not, like him, a\\n\"Doctor of God-knows-what” just back from the universities of\\nFrance, he was still very fond of playing the venerable uncle\\nwhen he was with Tu Hsin-to, and indulging his fondness for\\nlecturing people. Tu Hsin-to, wearing his usual air of blase\\n\\nsuperiority, draped himself nonchalantly against the doorpost\\nand smiled faintly.\\n\\n“The trouble with you is that your experience has been rather\\nlimited. My theory isn’t something I’ve dreamed up in bed:\\nit’s something that’s been tried out and has produced results in\\nEngland, or it may have been America, I don’t remember exactly\\nwhich — anyway, it was one of the two, And it’s also mentioned\\nin some elementary book on economics, where it says that this\\nshoe factory where all the workers have shares in the business\\nhas made great strides and has never had any labour trouble\\nwhatsoever, —If that isn’t practical proof I\\'d like to know what\\nis!”\\n\\n“All right, then: my theory’s also being put into practice,”\\nretorted Tu Hsueh-shih. “And producing good results, too. Just\\nlook at Italy!” He smiled triumphantly.\\n\\n“Ah, but itll never work in this country. Go and ask any\\nfactory-owner, and he’ll soon tell you whether it’ll work or not.”\\n\\n“And I suppose you’re going to tell me that your theory will\\nwork in China? What about you asking a factory-owner your-\\nself? Wu Sun-fu, for instance!’\\n\\nTu Hsueh-shih looked annoyed, but his annoyance was tinged\\nwith satisfaction at having found a qualified arbitrator in Wu\\nSun-fu. Without waiting for Tu Hsin-to’s reply or asking his\\nopinion of his choice of arbitrator, he took a step forward and\\ncalled out loudly to Wu Sun-fu:\\n\\n“Sun-ful If you tried to get all the girls in your factory to\\nbuy shares in the business, so that they could be shareholders\\nof Yu Hua Silk Filature like yourself, would it work?”\\n\\nThis sudden query startled Wu Sun-fu out of his reverie. He\\nlooked round and frowned. Li Yu-ting, who was sitting opposite\\nWu Sun-fu, also looked round in surprise at the grim expression\\non Tu Hsueh-shih’s face. However, being a professor of economics\\nand having heard a snatch or two of their conversation in the\\ndoorway, Li Yu-ting sized up the situation readily. He in-\\nstinctively raised his hand to scratch his head, as he invariably\\ndid when about to deliver himself of his opinion on anything,\\nbut Tu Hsueh-shih beat him to it, and hastened to explain in a\\nponderous but agitated voice. He was evidently taking the\\nmatter very seriously.\\n\\n“We\\'re discussing how to prevent labour trouble. Hsin-to says\\nthere’ll be no labour trouble if the workers are all shareholders,\\nand he mentions a shoe factory in England as an example. But\\nI say his theory won’t work: if a worker’s rich enough to be a\\nshareholder, he ceases to be a worker, and if a factory has only\\nshareholders and no workers it’s going to be a queer sort of\\nfactory!”\\n\\nTu Hsueh-shih paused for breath, and immediately a gale of\\nlaughter swept the room. Even Tu Hsin-to joined in. The\\nonly exception was Wu Sun-fu, who just parted his lips in a\\nbarely perceptible smile.\\n\\nThe sound of laughter brought Wu Chih-sheng and Fan Po-\\nwen in from the dining-room, where they had been watching the\\ngame of mahjong. They immediately joined in the merriment as\\nif they knew what was going on.\\n\\n“You\\'ve got it all wrong, Uncle Hsueh-shih,” declared Tu Hsin-\\nto quietly amid the laughter. “My theory isn’t as simple as all\\nthat.”\\n\\nTu Hsueh-shih immediately scowled and turned angrily on\\nTu Hsin-to. “Perhaps you’ll explain your theory yourself, then?”\\n\\nTu Hsin-to smiled and shook his head, then pursed his lips and\\nbegan quietly whistling a popular French tune. Tu Hsueh-shih\\ntook this attitude of his nephew as a downright insult and\\ncrimsoned violently. Fortunately, Fan Po-wen came to the rescue.\\n\\n“J think I know what Tu Hsin-to means. He’s suggesting that\\nin a factory the shareholders should be workers and the workers\\nshareholders. That is to say, the share capital is contributed and\\ncontrolled by the workers themselves instead of being concen-\\ntrated in the hands of a few big shareholders. This may be a\\ngood solution to the problem. The only trouble is that the\\nwomen employed in Sun-fu’s factory are so poor that they’ve\\nnothing left to call their own except their ever-hungry mouths!”\\n\\nThis time even Wu Sun-fu had to laugh. But he still made\\nno comment. He had never had any time for all this empty\\ntheorizing that these youngsters were so fond of.\\n\\nColonel Lei sat with one leg crossed over the other, drawing\\non a cigarette and slowly shaking his head. He had been back\\nin Shanghai for three days now, but his terrible experiences\\nunder fire at the front and his worries and grievances as a prisoner\\n\\nof war—the result of misjudging enemy positions — were still\\nfresh in his mind. He had become pessimistic about the war\\nand about his own career as well. Hence the worried way in\\nwhich he was shaking his head.\\n\\n“There you are then!” resumed Tu Hsueh-shih. “Hsin-to’s\\ntheory just wouldn’t work! Now, I’ve got a better one. I’m dead\\nagainst factory-owners closing down, or even cutting down pro-\\nduction, just because they\\'re suffering some temporary setback.\\nIf Chinese industry is to be developed, our industrialists must\\nbe prepared to suffer certain initial losses. Both sides must do\\ntheir level best to help the country: the workers should be for-\\nbidden to strike, and factory-owners should be forbidden to\\nsuspend operations!”\\n\\nHaving, in his opinion, finally disposed of his nephew’s\\nargument, Tu Hsueh-shih fully expected that when he brought\\nout his own theory he would have an attentive audience; but\\nto his mortification no one paid the least attention to what he\\nwas saying. Tu Hsin-to had joined Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-\\nsheng and gone out on to the front steps to discuss something\\nelse. Wu Sun-fu, Li Yu-ting and Colonel Lei chatted for a\\nmoment about the idea of having “worker-shareholders,”’ but the\\nconversation gradually veered back to the continual ebb and\\nflow of the front line. A scowl contorted Tu Hsueh-shih’s cat-\\nlike face, and he stalked off in high dudgeon to watch the mahjong\\ngame in the dining-room again.\\n\\nThe discussion of the latest events in the war was now in full\\nswing, and Wu Sun-fu’s face was flushed with excitement once\\nmore. Although the recent changes in the military situation\\nalong the northern section of the Tientsin-Pukow line had in-\\nvolved the Yi Chung Trust Company in certain losses over their\\ngovernment bond investments, Wu Sun-fu had great hopes of\\nan early improvement in the situation, and so he was in fairly\\nhigh spirits. He turned to Colonel Lei:\\n\\n“It looks as if the war’s fast coming to an end, don’t you\\nthink? The bankers had definite confirmation today that Tsinan’s\\nbeen evacuated.”\\n\\n“Hm! I don’t think it’s going to be as easy as all that,”\\ncountered Colonel Lei, the “optimist” again now that his opinion\\nwas wanted. “After Tsinan, there’s still Hsuchow! War’s a\\n\\nmysterious affair, unpredictable. Sometimes a battered line or\\nsurrounded city can hold out for as long as six months. No, I\\nthink the war’s going to drag on for some time yet!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled faintly to himself. Although he did not\\nknow all the ins and outs of why the colonel had gone to Tientsin\\nfrom the front line and then come back to Shanghai, he could\\nmake a very shrewd guess at the reason, so it was only natural\\nthat he should smile to himself at what Colonel Lei was now\\nsaying. The last thing Wu Sun-fu wanted was another long-\\ndrawn-out struggle at Hsuchow after the one at Tsinan— that\\nwould be too great a blow to his speculations! He now turned\\nto Li Yu-ting, who, to his surprise, suddenly leapt to his feet in\\ngreat agitation.\\n\\n“what! The war drags on for another six months? But,\\nColonel Lei, that would be terrible! Just think of the present\\nsituation: there’s Ho Lung in and out of Shasi and Tayeh, Peng\\nTeh-huai in Liuyang, Fang Chih-min holding Chingtehchen, and\\nMao Tse-tung and Chu Teh prodding at Chian. If the war drags\\non for another six months, there’s no telling how far these Com-\\nmunists will go! We\\'ll all be done for in no time!”\\n\\n“you\\'re surely not worrying about those bandits?” exclaimed\\nthe colonel. “They’ll just fold up before a proper army. No, we\\ndon’t take them seriously. Though of course the Japanese\\nnewspapers exaggerate the danger from that direction — but\\nthen they\\'ve got an axe to grind. The reason the Japanese are\\nspreading these rumours is to damage the prestige of the Central\\nGovernment.”\\n\\nColonel Lei’s “optimism” was getting the better of him now,\\nand the light of battle gleamed in his eyes. Li Yu-ting shook\\nhis head as if in disbelief, then turned to Wu Sun-fu and gave\\nhim a solemn warning:\\n\\n“You know, Sun-fu, it\\'s a great pity that you’re having this\\ntrouble in your factory at a time like this! You must settle it\\nat once— by force, if necessary! This general strike of the silk-\\nworkers is just one part of the Communists’ plan for nation-wide\\nriots during July, and the present trouble is the starting-signal!\\nWhen your girls stoned your car this afternoon, they were actually\\nrioting! If you don’t crush them first, they may quite easily go\\n\\nand do something like setting fire to the factory! You couldn\\'t\\nrecover your losses then, even if you killed the lot of them!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu winced as the memory of the afternoon’s frightening\\nepisode at the factory gate came back to him. The hum of the\\nelectric fan reminded him of the angry roar of the crowd. To\\nmake things worse, something else now occurred to prod at his\\ntroubled mind: Kao Sheng suddenly appeared with two men\\nfrom the factory — Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan, both\\nlooking rather agitated.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu sprang to his feet and asked in a stern voice, though\\nwith a hint of trepidation, “Have you just come from the factory?\\nHow are things down there? No trouble, I hope?”\\n\\n“Not up to the time we left,” they replied, both speaking at the\\nsame time. “But we\\'ve got some important news for you.”\\n\\nAs they spoke, they stared at Wu Sun-fu in a peculiar manner.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu felt slightly relieved and did not immediately de-\\nmand to know what this important news was that had brought\\nthem hurrying over at this time of night. He paced to and fro\\nfor a moment, a forced smile on his lips, then shot Wu Wei-cheng\\nand Ma Ching-shan a sharp look, as much as to say, “So you\\'re\\nhere to inform against Tu Wei-yueh again, eh?” The two of them\\njust stood there rather stiffly and said nothing.\\n\\nWhen Colonel Lei saw that Wu Sun-fu was going to be busy,\\nhe took his leave. Li Yu-ting strolled out into the garden to\\njoin Tu Hsin-to and Fan Po-wen. Left alone in the room, Wu\\nWei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan exchanged glances and wondered\\nwhether they were to succeed or fail in their task. The clatter\\nof mahjong-tiles came from the dining-room next door.\\n\\n“Now, what’s this important business of yours?” demanded\\nWu Sun-fu crossly as he came back from seeing the colonel off.\\n“Tu Wei-yueh in the wrong again, I suppose?”\\n\\nHe indicated with a wave of his hand that they should sit down.\\n\\nBut this time the two young men had not very much to say\\nagainst Tu Wei-yueh. They had come to offer Wu Sun-fu a\\nsolution to the strike problem. Actually, they had been sent by\\nChien Pao-sheng, the author of the plan.\\n\\n“Uncle Sun-fu,” began Wu Wei-cheng. “Chien Pao-sheng has\\na lot of influence in the trade union. He knows practically\\neverything there is to know about the girls. For two days now\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh’s been hunting around, but he still hasn’t been able\\nto find out which of the girls are Communists, whereas Chien\\nPao-sheng has known all the time. What Chien Pao-sheng sug-\\ngests is that we should arrest the Communists and at the same\\ntime get rid of a whole batch of trouble-makers among the girls.\\nHis idea is that once we’ve done that the union should be re-\\nsponsible for bringing in new girls and guaranteeing for their good\\nconduct. If the management wants to cut wages or stop the\\npayment of overtime for Sunday work or anything like that, he\\nthinks the union should be consulted first, so that they can take\\nthe matter up with the women. Chien Pao-sheng says he can\\nguarantee to prevent any further trouble of this kind even if\\nyou decide to cut wages by forty or fifty per cent.... Uncle\\nSun-fu, if you\\'ll only try what Chien Pao-sheng suggests,\\nyou\\'ll find you won\\'t have to spend all your time worrying about\\nlabour trouble, which will be quite a load off your mind. Don’t\\nyou think it’s a wonderful idea? Chien Pao-sheng would have\\nliked to tell you about it himself long ago, but he was afraid you\\nwouldn\\'t listen to him, so he put it off till today, when he told\\nme and Ching-shan about it. He’s the sort of man that if he\\nsays he’ll do a thing, he\\'ll do it!”\\n\\n“As for getting the girls back to work tomorrow as he says he\\nwill,” added Ma Ching-shan, “why, Tu Wei-yueh will never\\nmanage it! The girls hate him like poison! This afternoon he\\nwent down to their huts to arrest somebody, which only made\\nthings worse! He’s just asking for trouble, doing a thing like\\nthat! The girls all realize that you\\'re losing money, and they\\nsay they\\'re quite willing to discuss the matter of a wage-cut\\nwith you; but they say they’d rather die than go back to work\\nwhile this fellow Tu is still in charge! The situation now is\\nthat all the girls in the factory are lined up against one man —\\nTu Wei-yueh! They absolutely hate him! And all the forewomen\\nhate him as well!”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Ma Ching-shan’s shifty eyes darted uneasily from\\nWu Sun-fu to Wu Wei-cheng and back again. Wu Wei-cheng\\nsat there in a respectful attitude, nodding his head and looking\\nanxious, though listening with half an ear to the clicking of\\nmahjong-tiles in the next room and silvery laughter of Lin Pei-\\nshan.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled darkly as if to remind them that “to hear 1s\\nnot to believe,” but his eyes betrayed his growing indecision. He\\nraised his hand to finger his chin and raised his eyebrows as if\\nhe was going to say something, but changed his mind and jerked\\nhis hand up from his chin to his forehead; he wiped it down the\\nwhole length of his face, then let it fall on to the arm of his\\nchair. Still he said nothing. To all the other worries which\\nwere tugging his mind in different directions there was now\\nadded another worry. He felt he no longer had the energy to\\ncontinue the struggle to preserve his mental balance. The\\nsmouldering fires of his resentment blazed into life once more,\\nand Wu Wei-cheng chose this moment to pour oil on the flames.\\n\\n“Unele Sun-fu! It’s not that I like running people down, but\\nI’m just fed up with Tu Wei-yueh and I feel I must tell you about\\nhim. He just relies on bluff and putting on a show with his bright\\nideas and his swank! His specialty’s bribery, but he’s just\\nthrowing your money away by the handful! And now he’s prom-\\nised the forewomen and supervisors a dollar for every girl they\\nget to go back to work—don’t you think that’s a cheek?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s face suddenly darkened; his confidence in Tu\\nWei-yueh was now completely shaken. He crashed his fist down\\non the arm of the chair and roared: “Is that true? You’re\\nnot lying to me, are you?”\\n\\n“As if I\\'d dare! Ching-shan knows about it, too.”\\n\\n“Humph! How is it that Mo Kan-cheng hasn’t told me\\nanything about it? The old scoundrel, he hasn’t said a word to\\nme about it!”\\n\\n“Perhaps even Mr. Mo doesn’t know about it yet,” Ma Ching-\\nshan put in hurriedly. “Tu Wei-yueh’s a real dictator —he keeps\\neverybody in the dark about what he’s up to.”\\n\\nHe tipped Wu Wei-cheng a furtive wink, though Wu Sun-fu\\nwas so overcome with rage that he did not notice it. He sud-\\ndenly sprang to his feet and bellowed through the door, ‘Kao\\nSheng! Ring up Mr. Mo and ask him to come round at\\nonce — no, wait a minute, ring up the factory and get Tu Wei-\\nyueh to come to the phone. I want to speak to him!”\\n\\n“But, Uncle, you don’t have to be so hasty about it,” hurriedly\\nintervened Wu Wei-cheng. “It’s only hearsay, so far. We\\nhaven’t any definite proof yet, and Tu Wei-yueh may deny it.”\\n\\nHe tipped Ma Ching-shan a wink, but the latter was too agitated\\nto speak and just sat and gaped, wide-eyed.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu inclined his head in thought for a moment, then\\nsnorted and returned to his chair. After a moment he flapped\\na hand at Kao Sheng, who was waiting just outside the door\\nfor his orders, and said peevishly, “You can go. There’s no need\\nto ring anybody now.”\\n\\n“J think it would be best, Uncle, if you were to send for Chien\\nPao-sheng tomorrow and ask him about it,” suggested Wu Wei-\\ncheng, trying to beat a hasty retreat before Wu Sun-fu saw\\nthrough them. “If Tu Wei-yueh fails in his attempt to get the\\ngirls back to work tomorrow, there’s no reason why you shouldn\\'t\\ngive Chien Pao-sheng’s plan a trial.” As he spoke, he gave Ma\\nChing-shan another sly wink.\\n\\nFor a moment there was silence in the room. Outside in the\\ngarden the trees could be heard rustling in the wind, and from\\ntime to time there came roars of laughter from Li Yu-ting and\\nthe others. From the dining-room came the sound of mahjong-\\ntiles being shuffled round on the surface of the table and the\\nshrill voices of the ladies as they commented on the extraordi-\\nnary luck of the banker in the game they had just finished.\\n\\nAll these noises irritated Wu Sun-fu, but he just could not\\nshut his ears to them as they hammered away at his mind. His\\nhead was in such a whirl that it was beyond him to make up his\\nmind. At one moment he felt that Tu Wei-yueh was hard to\\nhandle, too obstinate, too cunning, too confident; at the next he\\nbegan to have his doubts about the truth of what he had just\\nheard, and decided he must believe his eyes rather than his\\nears. He shook his head wearily and turned to the two young\\nmen, who were beginning to show signs of nervousness.\\n\\n“All right, I\\'ve heard what you\\'ve got to say. You can go\\nnow, but mind you don’t gossip about it to anyone else.”\\n\\nHaving disposed of Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan in the\\npatronizing tone of a family elder, Wu Sun-fu got up and walked\\nout. His growing irascibility was now accompanied by a strange,\\nunaccountable feeling of despair.\\n\\nHe shut himself up in his study and began reviewing in minute\\ndetail all that Tu Wei-yueh had said and done during the past\\ntwo davs, and comparing it with the criticisms of Wu Wei-cheng\\n\\nand Ma Ching-shan; but the more he thought about everything,\\nthe sharper became his conflicting moods of anger and despair.\\nHe was surprised at himself, and at the way his customary\\nruthlessness and strength of purpose had deserted him. Even\\nhis never-failing energy seemed to have run out of him. As he\\nsat there, his jumbled thoughts creeping sluggishly through his\\nhead, he became aware of the sound of the wind in the trees\\noutside his window: it reminded him of the noise of the crowd\\nwhich had hemmed him in at the factory gate that afternoon,\\nand he felt again the same thrill of fear. As he looked at the\\nglow of light which lit up the yellow silk shade of the lamp on\\nhis desk, he could imagine the glow from a blazing factory—\\nhis own factory, fired by the girls! No, he just wasn’t his usual\\nself any more!\\n\\nYet still these sick fancies kept hammering at his mind, and\\nhis thoughts drifted from the factory to the Yi Chung Trust\\nCompany — to his loss of eighty thousand dollars in government\\nbond speculation, to Chao Po-tao’s financial blockade, to the eight\\ndried-up factories crying out for large sums of money, to the\\ncostly “white elephant” of a silk factory which he had taken\\nover from Chu Yin-chiu. ... All these problems rose up before\\nhim and whirled in a frantic merry-go-round through his head,\\nuntil, no longer able to think clearly, he just sat and groaned\\nunder the pitiless excesses of his imagination.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door-handle turned with a creak, and Wu Sun-fu\\nwoke from his nightmare with a start to see Wang Ho-fu’s round\\nface, wearing a worried frown and a wry smile. He rubbed his\\neyes and looked again—it really was Wang Ho-fu, and he had\\nsat down. Without quite realizing what he was doing, Wu Sun-\\nfu blurted out:\\n\\n“Why, Ho-fu! Is something wrong at the eight factories?”\\n\\n“Well, yes, but it’s nothing much— You don’t mean to say\\nyou already know about it, Sun-fu?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu shook his head, still sure that he was dreaming.\\nHe fixed his eyes on Wang Ho-fu’s moustache in a vacant stare.\\n\\n“It’s nothing very serious at the moment,” said Wang Ho-fu.\\n“It’s just that everywhere’s being affected by the war and a\\ndepression’s setting in. Every consignment we sent out last week\\nhas simply been returned intact. What are we going to do\\n\\nfrom now on? We work our fingers to the bone to raise the\\nnecessary capital, sink it in these eight factories, and then, just\\nwhen production is getting under way, there’s no market for the\\ngoods, so we have to put them in the warehouse and pay for\\nstorage. We just can’t carry on indefinitely like this.”\\n\\nHe heaved a sigh and fixed his eyes on Wu Sun-fu.\\n\\nSo it was not that the factories had gone on strike, as Wu\\nSun-fu had at first feared. He felt slightly relieved at that,\\nbut in a flash this sense of relief vanished, to be replaced by an\\neven fiercer feeling of anger and despair. At this moment,\\nevery one of his worries seemed to be tearing at his mind at\\nonce. His spirit was shattered and he found it absolutely im-\\npossible to bear the strain. His will was gone, and there re-\\nmained only a sullen fury and despair.\\n\\nWhen no reply was forthcoming, Wang Ho-fu frowned slightly\\nand went on slowly:\\n\\n“There’s something else. I hear the Central Army has not been\\nappreciably weakened, even though they’ve lost Tsinan. On top\\nof that, a really strong defence-line has been built up in front\\nof every single key point south of Tsinan. It’s going to be a\\nlong-drawn-out tussle—several months, I should say. Some\\npeople even predict that it\\'ll see the year out. Oh, what a mess!\\nAs things are, we’ll have to make a swift, realistic decision about\\nwhat we\\'re going to do about these eight factories of ours. If\\nwe don’t. we’re going to go under the way the others have done!”\\n\\n“The fighting last the year out? Impossible!. . . Though you\\ncan never tell!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu had said something at last, but he might just\\nas well have said nothing. It was not like him to contradict\\nhimself in the same sentence like that, and Wang Ho-fu was\\nrather surprised himself. He supposed Wu Sun-fu had been\\noverdoing it in his own factory the past few days, so that his\\nmind was now a little blurred. He looked at Wu Sun-fu’s face\\nand decided he did look out of sorts. He heaved a sigh of\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n“T can see you\\'re tired, Sun-fu, so I won\\'t disturb you any\\nlonger. We can talk about it tomorrow.”\\n\\n“No, no, don\\'t go yet! I insist that we thrash the matter out\\nnow!’\\n\\n“All right, then ... Sun Chi-jen and I have talked it over, and\\nwe suggest that, starting next month, the eight factories should\\ngo on half time—that is, in addition to the wage-cut and the\\nreduction of staff that we’ve already agreed upon. After a\\nmonth like that, we can see how things are going, and decide\\n\\nwhat to do.”\\n“Eh? Go on half time?” exclaimed Wu Sun-fu, springing to\\n\\nhis feet. His dark face was flushed and his expression was\\nstrange and rather frightening. “Why, that’d be asking for\\ntrouble! Workers nowadays are liable to smash up the factory\\nor set it on fire just as soon as they look at you!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu was taken aback for a moment, but he quickly put\\non a smile and said, “Oh, no, no fear of anything like that hap-\\npening. You’re forgetting that these are all small factories rang-\\ning from a hundred to three hundred workers apiece at the most.\\nThere’s not enough of them to riot. You look really worn out,\\nSun-fu. You don’t want to overdo it, you know. Why not take\\na few days’ holiday?”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s nothing, really; I\\'ll be all right. Well, you’d better put\\nthem on half time, then.”\\n\\n“Except for the silk goods factory, which will have to stay on\\nfull time until we’ve filed our orders for the autumn,” Wang Ho-fu\\nadded. He was quite sure now that there was something wrong\\nwith Wu Sun-fu, and after a few casual words, he took his\\ndeparture.\\n\\nThe sky was now a pall of black cloud. Li Yu-ting and the\\nothers had left, and the garden was deserted. The lights among\\nthe thick foliage of the trees had been switched off, and a heavy\\ngloom had descended on the garden. From the windows of the\\ndining-room there still came the blaze of lights, the clatter of\\nmahjong-tiles, and the excited voices of the players, while in the\\nlarge drawing-room the wireless was twanging out the last item\\nof the day’s programme—a popular Shanghai ballad. Having seen\\nhis visitor off, Wu Sun-fu wandered back to the study. Now, bit\\nby bit, his conversation with Wang Ho-fu began to come back to\\nhim like the memory of a dream, and he realized how agitated\\nhe had been and how feeble he must have appeared.\\n\\nAs this realization came home to him, he was seized once more\\nby a consuming rage—and not just rage alone, but by hatred of\\n\\nhimself. This hate and anger he now transferred to everything\\naround him. He paced up and down the study in a frenzy, his\\neyes bloodshot and his teeth clenched. All he wanted now was\\nsomeone to vent his rage upon. He wanted to destroy something.\\nAll the reverses he had suffered over his own factory and over\\nthe Yi Chung Trust Company now fused into a single savage im-\\npulse, the impulse to destroy something!\\n\\nHe lowered himself on to the swivel chair behind his desk and\\nsat there like some wild beast lying in wait for its prey, his eyes\\ndarting from side to side in search of something whose destruc-\\ntion would give him the satisfaction he needed and provide an\\noutlet for his savage desire to destroy!\\n\\nThe maid, Wang Mah, came in with a bowl of bird’s-nest gruel\\nfor him. Wu Sun-fu did not notice her until she placed the bowl\\non the desk in front of him, when his burning gaze suddenly fell\\nupon her hands, white, plump and dimpled. The fierce flames\\nof his mad desire to destroy suddenly rose to white heat. He\\njerked up his head and fixed his bloodshot eyes on her face. To\\nhim Wang Mah was no longer Wang Mah, the maid, but an ob-\\nject, an object to be violated, an object whose violation would best\\nafford him satisfaction!\\n\\nHe sprang up and swooped on her, on this object that he would\\nviolate. Wang Mah seemed taken aback for a fleeting moment,\\nbut then she smiled invitingly as if she understood and stepped\\ndaintily back, watching him with amorous eyes which neverthe-\\nless betrayed a hint of apprehension and shyness. Before he had\\ntime to realize what she was doing, she moved quickly back into\\nthe corner and stood there leaning against the wall. Then the\\nplump, dimpled hand moved upwards to the light-switch. The\\nceiling-light went out, leaving only the pool of yellow light beneath\\nthe lamp on the desk. Then even this light was extinguished,\\nand the room was plunged in darkness, except for the faint glow\\nof a distant light which flecked the net curtains over the window\\nwith leaf-shadows.\\n\\nWhen the light came on again, Wu Sun-fu was lying alone on\\nthe sofa, his brows knit in a frown and his eyes staring vacantly.\\nHis strange fury had passed, but his mind was now occupied by\\na puzzled feeling of not knowing exactly what he had been do-\\ning. He felt as if it had all been a monstrous dream. Gradually,\\n\\nthe same old merry-go-round began again—would the girls go\\nback tomorrow? How could he dispose of the goods produced\\nby the eight factories? What should he do about Tu Wei-yueh\\nand Chien Pao-sheng? All these problems had soon taken pos-\\nsession of his mind again.\\n\\nHe smiled wryly, then closed his eyes and gnawed his lips.\\n\\nThe clock in the study showed the first hour of the new day,\\nbut the dining-room still rang with talk and laughter and the\\nclatter of mahjong-tiles.\\nXV\\n\\nNEXT morning, the sky was hidden by a white mist. While the\\nnight-soil carts still rumbled through the streets, the hooter\\nsounded in the Yu Hua Silk Filature. Outside the factory gate\\nstood a line of policemen, armed with rifles and Mausers, to\\nensure that the return to work should go off without a hitch.\\nPockmarked Li, Wang Chin-chen and all the other supervisors\\nand forewomen were patrolling up and down around the work-\\nshop. Their faces were pale after a sleepless night, their eyes\\nwere bloodshot, and they were tense with excitement.\\n\\nThis was the decisive moment of a decisive battle! These well-\\ntried, highly-honoured “heroes and heroines” were preparing to\\n“quaff the cup of victory”—though not, of course, without some\\nqualms about the possible outcome.\\n\\nOn the veranda in front of the office building, Tu Wei-yueh\\nwas pacing up and down like some great general awaiting news\\nof victory from the front. His air was resolute and confident.\\nHe was well aware that Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan had\\nbeen to see Wu Sun-fu the night before, but that did not worry\\nhim in the least. He had made all his arrangements down to\\nthe last detail, and he was well satisfied with the results achieved\\nby the forewomen and supervisors in a hard night’s work. There\\nwas only one little thing that worried him—Ah Hsiang had not\\nyet reported back to him, the bastard!\\n\\nThe hooter went a second time, this time longer and louder\\nthan the first. After it had stopped, Tu Wei-yueh’s ears still\\nrang for a few seconds. Now, all the lights in the workshop went\\non together, though through the thick mist they showed as blurs\\nlike will-o’-the-wisps.\\n\\nJust then, Kuei Chang-lin came running up. His little beady\\neyes, set slightly askew in his long, square-jawed face, were fixed\\nsteadily on Tu Wei-yuch as he ran.\\n\\n“Well? How are things going, Chang-lin?”\\n\\n“The girls are coming back! In twos and threes, and in\\ndozens, too!”\\n\\nThe two men smiled together. The worst was over! Tu Wei-\\nyueh turned and ran into the office, picked up the telephone and\\ngave the operator Wu Sun-fu’s home number. He was anxious\\nto pass on the news of their first victory. Wu Wei-cheng, Ma\\nChing-shan and Tseng Chia-chu were in the room, grimacing and\\ngiving each other significant glances. Just as Tu Wei-yueh even-\\ntually got through, a sudden sound of shouting came from out-\\nside. Wu Wei-cheng and the other two immediately rushed out.\\nTu Wei-yueh turned his head to look out of the window and smiled\\nsardonically. He knew what the noise meant—evidently some\\nof the more recalcitrant girls were trying to picket the gate.\\nThis was no more than he had expected—in fact, he had already\\ngiven orders that anyone attempting to picket the factory should\\nbe arrested without more ado. He had nothing to worry about.\\nWhen he turned back to the telephone, he found that he had\\nbeen cut off. He was just going to ring through again, when\\nan even louder roar was heard outside. The next moment some-\\none burst into the office shouting at the top of her voice: it was\\nAh Chen, her hair hanging loose over her face.\\n\\n“They’re fighting! They’re fighting!’ she shouted, flinging her-\\nself almost into Tu Wei-yueh’s arms. He dropped the receiver\\nwith a cry of rage, then thrust Ah Chen aside and flew out of\\nthe door. Just as he came out on to the veranda he collided\\nwith Wang Chin-chen, who was also racing up like one possessed,\\nher face a deathly white.\\n\\n“Picketing, eh? Run them straight in!” shouted Tu Wei-yueh\\nas he ran towards the gate. He was pale with rage at Kuei\\nChang-lin and Pockmarked Li for being so utterly useless. But\\nwhen he reached the cocoon-stores he stopped: a woe-begone\\nKuei Chang-lin was running towards him with a bleeding face.\\nDown at the gate a scuffle was going on, with the police trying\\nto part the combatants in a half-hearted, face-saving sort of\\nway. There did not appear to be any girls among them, though\\n\\noutside the gate several dozen girls were standing in clusters\\nsome distance away, shouting and gesticulating excitedly. Kuei\\nChang-lin tried to hold Tu Wei-yueh back.\\n\\n“Don’t go down there!” he gasped. “Our people are getting\\nbeaten up! Don’t go!”\\n\\n‘Nonsense! Haven’t any of you got any guts? What’s hap-\\npened to Pockmarked Li?”\\n\\n“\"Ie’s down there in the middle of the crowd!”\\n\\n“The useless idiot! He hasn’t got a clue!”\\n\\nSwearing angrily, Tu Wei-yueh brushed Kuei Chang-lin aside\\nand ran on. Kuei Chang-lin turned and ran after him, still\\nshouting “Don’t go!” Near the gate Tu Wei-yueh found Tseng\\nChia-chu standing on a bench with Wu Wei-cheng and Ma\\nChing-shan standing in front of him; the three of them looked\\nhighly elated and were shouting encouragement to the tussling\\ncrowd. On one side of the gateway stood Chien Pao-sheng, talk-\\ning with someone who looked like a police sergeant. Tu Wei-\\nyueh took it all in at a glance and began to realize what was\\nhappening. He saw red. Dashing up to Tseng Chia-chu and\\nthe other two, he bellowed furiously:\\n\\n“What are you lot doing here? Directing the fight? Just you\\nwait, I\\'ll report this to Mr. Wu!”\\n\\nThe three young men were taken aback for the moment, then\\nTseng Chia-chu hurled himself at Tu Wei-yueh with a snarl, but\\nKuei Chang-lin quickly tripped him up from behind and he went\\nsprawling. Tu Wei-yueh now dashed across to the gate, thrust\\nChien Pao-sheng unceremoniously aside, and addressed the\\npolice sergeant:\\n\\n“Pm the manager, name of Tu! Please tell your men to round\\nup these hooligans who are attacking my people from the\\nfactory!”\\n\\n“Ah, but we can’t tell which are which!”\\n\\n“Then round up the whole lot of them!” bawled Tu Wei-yueh.\\n“We can sort them out later on!”\\n\\nHe turned to look for Chien Pao-sheng, but he had already\\nmade himself scarce. The sergeant now began blowing his\\nwhistle and running towards the crowd. The crowd broke up\\nand a dozen or so of them took to their heels, while at the\\nsame time three or four policemen came running up to the gate\\n\\nin answer to the whistle. Tu Wei-yueh caught sight of Ah Hsiang\\namong those who were running away, and now he understood\\neverything. He pointed Ah Hsiang out to the policemen. “Stop\\nthat man! We want him! Bring him round to the accounts\\noffice!’\\n\\nAh Hsiang gaped dumbstruck at his captors, then tried to ex-\\nplain, but Tu Wei-yueh was already racing back in through the\\ngate.\\n\\nThe whole disturbance had lasted only six or seven minutes,\\nbut it seemed like a hundred years to Ah Chen, who was still\\nhiding in the office, trembling with fear. As Tu Wei-yueh came\\nback into the room, Ah Chen sprang up, her hair still tousled,\\nand caught hold of his arm. He gave her a contemptuous\\nglance, then shook her off and snarled, “You made sure you\\ndidn’t get your precious hide damaged, then! If everybody was\\nlike you, I might as well give up straight away!”\\n\\n“You didn’t see how flerce those devils were! They—”\\n\\n“Shut up!” he snapped. “It’s all over now. Go and fetch\\nKuei Chang-lin and Pockmarked Li!”\\n\\nHe went quickly across to the telephone and picked up the\\nreceiver, which was still off the hook from last time. He began\\ncalling the operator, but suddenly changed his mind, hung it\\nup again, and ran out of the office. For one fleeting moment\\nhe had had an idea, but now it had gone clean out of his head.\\nHe stamped his foot with annoyance and began pacing up and\\ndown, fuming with vexation. Just at that moment he saw Mo\\nKan-cheng shambling hurriedly towards him, a pair of ancient,\\ndown-at-heel shoes on his feet and a long gown draped round\\nhis shoulders.\\n\\n“T say, Wei-yueh, what are you holding Ah Hsiang for?” he\\ndemanded abruptly.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh’s face hardened and he gave no answer. His\\nlips suddenly twisted in a mirthless smile and he roared in Mo\\nKan-cheng’s face, “Mr. Mo! Will you please tell them from me\\nthat I, Tu Wei-yueh, am quite willing to talk things over\\nquietly, but I just won’t stand being pushed around! What the\\nhell do they think they’re doing setting a gang of hooligans on\\nus just when we\\'re getting the factory going again! Ah Hsiang’s\\nan overseer, and if he has a hand in making trouble, of course\\n\\nhe must be punished! In any case, until Mr. Wu comes in, I\\nalone am responsible for everything that goes on in this factory!”\\n\\n“Can\\'t the two of you come to some peaceable arrangement,\\nif only to save an old man’s old face? After all, you’re really\\nold friends—”\\n\\n“Not When Mr. Wu comes, I\\'ll hand in my resignation and\\nclear out of here, bag and baggage. It’s no good asking me\\nto make peace with those hooligans: I just can’t!— Now, Mr. Mo,\\nwill you watch the phone and make sure that nobody uses it!\\nIf anything happens through your negligence, you\\'ll be held\\nresponsible!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh’s face was dark now, and his gimlet eyes bored\\ninto Mo Kan-cheng’s. He knew the old man was as soft as wax.\\nMo Kan-cheng narrowed his rat-like eyes and was just going\\nto speak, when Kuei Chang-lin and Pockmarked Li came round\\nthe corner, followed by Wang Chin-chen and Ah Chen. One side\\nof Pockmarked Li’s face was bruised and swollen.\\n\\n“And don’t go ringing up Mr. Wu!” said Tu Wei-yueh to Mo\\nKan-cheng in a severe voice. “I\\'ll ask him to come round my-\\nself later on, and then everybody concerned can have it all out\\nin front of him!”\\n\\nWith this he went across to meet Kuei Chang-lin and the others\\nto hear what they had to say.\\n\\nThey all went across and stood by the notice-board in front\\nof the veranda. The morning mist was lifting now, and the\\nsunlight filtered through and fell on their faces. While Tu Wei-\\nyueh was listening to Kuei Chang-lin, the idea which had es-\\ncaped him a short while before suddenly struck him again. His\\nface immediately lit up; he motioned to Kuei Chang-lin to stop\\nand turned to Ah Chen:\\n\\n“Go and tell them to give another blast on the hooter, and make\\nit really long and loud this time!”\\n\\n“It’s no good blowing the hooter!” Ah Chen protested. “You\\ndon’t think they’re going to come in after all that fighting, do\\nyou?”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh’s face immediately darkened with anger, and Ah\\nChen quickly made off. He snorted and glanced round at the\\nothers. Suddenly, his features set firm and he rapped out in a\\nvoice as hard as iron: “You needn\\'t tell me any more: I know\\n\\nall about it! It was half the fault of some of the girls trying\\nto picket the gate, and half the fault of that perisher Chien Pao-\\nsheng throwing a spanner in the works! Those bastards don’t\\ncare a damn about the welfare of the factory! One thing, though:\\nwe\\'ve got hold of Ah Hsiang, and once we’ve interrogated him\\nwe\\'ll have definite proof! I’ll give him play tricks on me, the\\nlow-down thing! He’ll go straight down to the police station!\\nAnd as for Chien Pao-sheng, we’ll have him up for inciting the\\nwomen to strike and preventing them from returning to work\\nby using violence! I’ve been patient with them long enough, and\\nI can’t let them get away with it any longer!”\\n\\n“I think you’re wronging Ah Hsiang: he was only trying to stop\\nthe fight!” said Pockmarked Li anxiously, sticking up for his\\nfriend. Deep down inside, he was longing to put an end to all\\nthis quarrelling with Chien Pao-sheng, though he did not like\\nto say so openly. Tu Wei-yueh saw his dilemma at a glance and\\nburst out laughing. Being rather slow in the uptake, Kuei Chang-\\nlin turned on Pockmarked Li and protested indignantly:\\n\\n“We\\'re not wronging Ah Hsiang at all! I saw him with my\\nown eyes: he was telling them to stop and at the same time he\\nwas helping Chien Pao-sheng with his fists!’\\n\\n“Ah, but it’s always better to lose an enemy than to make\\none, Chang-lin! There’s no point in being too hard on them.\\nThe way I see it, we should get Chien Pao-sheng over here and\\ntalk things over properly. If he still refuses to come round, all\\nright, then he’ll only get rough treatment from Pockmarked Li!\\nDon\\'t you agree, Mr. Tu? Let’s make a friendly gesture to him\\nand see how he takes it!”\\n\\nJust then the factory hooter went again, this time for a good\\nthree minutes, howling away like an injured animal in pain.\\n\\n“How many of the girls have come back so far?” asked Tu\\nWei-yueh, changing the subject with a calm smile—though his\\ncalmness was forced, quite different from his usual manner.\\n\\n“Before the fight started, I’d counted over forty,” replied Wang\\nChin-chen, drawing a muffled sigh and shooting a glance at Kuei\\nChang-lin. The latter was staring up at the ceiling, his jaw set\\nfirm and the veins standing out blue on his forehead. Tu Wei-\\nyueh smiled grimly, feeling that his “régime” really was tottering\\nthis time. For all his manoeuvring and for all his skill in win-\\n\\nning over Pockmarked Li, now that the crisis had come the long-\\nestablished ties of friendship between Poeckmarked Li and Chien\\nPao-sheng had proved stronger than his own influence. He\\nthought for a moment, and then tried another tack.\\n\\n“All right, Li; since you say so, Ill let it pass this time! I’m\\nquite willing to have Chien Pao-sheng over and listen to any-\\nthing he’s got to say. But it’s imperative that the girls should\\ncall off the strike today! We\\'ve just tried the hooter again. I\\nexpect you\\'ll find Chien Pao-sheng in the little tea-house over the\\nway. Tell him that since we\\'re all good friends we can talk\\nthings over quite amicably—though if he tries any more of his\\nold tricks, I’ll have to take him in hand to keep order!”\\n\\n“If you want me to go, Mr. Tu, I\\'ll go, but wouldn’t it be better\\nif Kuei Chang-lin came with me?”\\n\\n“No! Id rather you went on your own this time,” said Tu Wei-\\nyueh quickly, getting in first before Kuei Chang-lin could say\\nanything. “I’ve got another job for Chang-lin.” He shot Pock-\\nmarked Li a last shrewd glance, then turned to Wang Chin-chen\\nand told her to take the other forewomen down to keep an eye\\non the workshop. He then set off back towards the office, taking\\nKuei Chang-lin with him. When he got there he found Mo Kan-\\ncheng in whispered conversation with Ma Ching-shan and the\\nother two of the trio. When they saw Tu Wei-yueh, they all fell\\nsilent. Pretending not to notice, he went straight across to the\\nthree young men and said with a smile:\\n\\n“You three gentlemen have had quite a busy time! I’ve got to\\nthe bottom of the matter and I now know what it was all about.\\nThere’s no harm in a couple of fellows having a little dust-up:\\nthey can shake hands afterwards, and that’s that. Only one little\\nthing went wrong: the girls were frightened away. But never\\nmind, they’ll be back any minute now.”\\n\\nThe three of them just gaped at him, speechless. Tu Wei-yueh\\nsmiled calmly at these three enemies of his and walked out. Kuei\\nChang-lin was walking to and fro on the veranda waiting. When\\nhe saw Tu Wei-yueh coming out, he looked round to make sure\\nthere was no one within earshot, then shifted closer to him and\\nasked in an undertone, “You’re not going to surrender to Chien\\nPao-sheng like this, are you, Mr. Tu?”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled but did not reply—he just kept walking.\\nKuei Chang-lin followed him in silence. After they had gone\\nsome little distance Tu Wei-yueh said quietly and calmly, “Who\\'s\\nChien Pao-sheng that you think I’m surrendering to him?”\\n\\n“But you’ve sent Pockmarked Li to fetch him!”\\n\\n“Don’t be so dense! We\\'ve got to soft-soap him for the time\\nbeing, until the girls have all come back to work; once they’re\\nback we can easily settle his hash! I\\'ve got Ah Hsiang locked\\nup in an empty room round the back, which means that we’ve\\nstill got means of proving that they started the trouble. If Pock-\\nmarked Li won’t toe the line, we’ll just have to find somebody\\nelse, though that’ll probably take us some time!\"\\n\\n“Chien Pao-sheng’s a wily old bird, you know. He\\'ll very likely\\nsee through your little game.”\\n\\n“Of course he will! But he can’t afford to make Pockmarked\\nLi lose too much face. We\\'ve given Pockmarked Li a chance to\\nsave his face, and if Chien Pao-sheng doesn’t do the same for\\nhim, he’ll come right round on to our side.”\\n\\nBoth men laughed and stopped on the open space in front of\\nthe workshop to wait for Pockmarked Li to come back from his\\nerrand.\\n\\nBy now the fog had lifted completely, and the sky was blue\\nwith a few blobs of white cloud. The two men began to feel\\na pleasant warmth as they stood bathed in sunlight. It was about\\nhalf past eight now. Tu Wei-yueh had gone to bed very late the\\nnight before, and ever since five o’clock he had been run off his\\nfeet with not a moment’s rest. He was tired, it was true, but\\nhe would not admit it. When he had been standing there wait-\\ning for a while, and was beginning to get impatient, he suddenly\\nremembered something and swung round to his companion.\\n\\n“There! They’ve worried me into such a state that I nearly\\nforgot! Chang-lin, I’ve got an important job for you! Go down\\nto the police station and tell them we want two of the girls\\narrested: Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin! You\\'ll have to show\\nthem the way. Damn Ah Hsiang! I told him last night to shad-\\now those two, but you can bet your life he didn’t—he went\\nstraight round to Chien Pao-sheng and his gang and then came\\nround with them this morning to stab us in the back! And\\nChang-lin, if you find anybody else in Ho Hsiu-mei’s hut or in\\n\\nChang Ah-hsin’s, arrest the whole bunch and don’t let any of them\\nget away!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh waved Kuei Chang-lin away and turned and went\\ninto the workshop. Work had not yet begun properly, and the\\nfilatures were running idly. More than a hundred girls had come\\nback, but they were sitting silent and sullen beside their ma-\\nchines. The forewomen were posted all round the workshop like\\nsentries. Putting on his most agreeable smile Tu Wei-yueh signed\\nto Ah Chen, who had come up, to have the machines switched\\noff. Immediately, a dead silence descended on the workshop,\\nexcept for the faint gurgling of boiling water in the cauldrons\\nand pans. Tu Wei-yueh took up a position in the centre of the\\nworkshop where the aisles crossed, with Wang Chin-chen on his\\nleft and Ah Chen on his right. He squared his shoulders and\\nshot a keen glance all round, then, in the most solemn and sincere\\nvoice he could muster, he launched out into a “pep-talk” to the\\nhundred-odd girls:\\n\\n“I wish to say a few words. I’ve been here for over two years\\nnow, and I’ve always got on very well with everybody. It’s more\\nthan a month since Mr. Wu made me general manager, and I\\nthink I can say I’ve never given myself airs. I know you are\\nall very hard up: I’m no better off myself. If it’s humanly pos-\\nsible to help you out, I’ll do it like a shot! The trouble is, the\\nprice of silk keeps falling, and every factory-owner is losing\\nmoney. All they get is about four hundred taels a bale! Get it?\\nFour hundred taels of silver! That means about six hundred\\ndollars! No factory-owner can lay golden eggs, so the only solu-\\ntion would be to close down the factory. And if the factory’s\\nclosed down, we all go hungry! As you all know, more than\\ntwenty silk factories in Shanghai have already been closed down.\\nBut Mr. Wu has done everything in his power to keep our factory\\ngoing: he’s run into debt and he’s mortgaged his house. The only\\nreason why he hasn\\'t closed down the factory is that he doesn\\'t\\nwant us all to starve! And the only reason why he’s cutting down\\nwages is that he’s in a very difficult position and has no alterna-\\ntive. If you\\'ll just think about it for a minute, I think you\\'ll\\nagree that it’s no joke being a factory-owner! The only way we\\ncan tide over the crisis is for everybody, employer and employees,\\nto work together and help one another! You girls here have\\n\\nbeen very sensible about it and come back to work today. What\\nyou should do when you go home is to tell the other girls that if\\nthey don’t return to work they’re taking the bread out of their\\nown mouths! It’s costing Mr. Wu a lot to keep the factory open,\\nand if people don’t appreciate what he’s doing for them, he’s\\ngoing to be very upset. If he should close down the factory, you\\nwouldn’t even get the new reduced rate of pay—not anywhere!\\nIf the trouble is that you can’t get on with me, that can easily\\nbe settled. There’s no need for you to go on strike—I can! As\\na matter of fact, I’ve already sent in my resignation once, but\\nMr. Wu hasn’t agreed to let me go yet, so for the time being V\\'ll\\njust have to carry on as I am now. If you’ve got anything to\\nsay, please don’t hesitate to speak up and let me know!”\\n\\nThere was not a sound but the grumbling of the boiling water\\nin the cauldrons and pans. The girls’ faces, flushed by the hot,\\nsteamy atmosphere, were as expressionless as the faces of statues.\\nInwardly, they were boiling with indignation and hatred, but\\ntheir feelings did not show on their faces: they stuck in their\\nthroats.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh felt strangely alone and deserted. Although the\\ntemperature in the workshop must have been about ninety de-\\ngrees, he felt an icy shiver running down his spine and gradually\\nspreading all over his body. He wandered miserably up and\\ndown for a moment, then looked at Wang Chin-chen and\\nshrugged his shoulders as much as to say, “That’s all—better get\\nthe machines started,” then made his escape.\\n\\nIn front of the veranda of the office building stood Pockmarked\\nLi and another man, looking all round expectantly. Seeing Tu\\nWei-yueh in the distance, coming across with his hands clasped\\nbehind him, Pockmarked Li called to him gleefully: ‘Mr. Tu!\\nWe\\'ve been looking for you for a long time! Chien Pao-sheng’s\\nhere with me!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh stopped at once and looked across at them with\\na calm smile, then straightened himself up and walked slowly\\nover. The lassitude which had followed his harangue in the\\nworkshop suddenly evaporated, and his head immediately began\\nbuzzing with ideas and schemes. He was now dealing with Chien\\nPao-sheng, which was quite a different matter from dealing with\\nthe girls. He felt quite at home dealing with a fellow like\\n\\nChien. Here at least was someone who could never give him\\nthat cold shiver down the spine!\\n\\nChien Pao-sheng greeted him with a faint smile, but said\\nnothing. It was a smile of triumph. Tu Wei-yueh pretended\\nnot to notice it, though under his mask of urbanity he resented\\nit bitterly.\\n\\nThe three men walked in silence round to the other side of the\\noffice building, each thinking his own thoughts, except that\\nPockmarked Li was making irrelevant remarks and laughing\\nexcitedly. They went into Wu Sun-fu’s office, where they were\\nnot likely to be disturbed, and got down to their discussion. Since\\nhe was the victor, Chien Pao-sheng put all his cards on the table\\nstraight away: he demanded that Hsueh Pao-chu, Chien Chiao-\\nlin and Chou Erh-chieh be reinstated; that Kuei Chang-lin be\\ntransferred to some other factory; that Tu Wei-yueh should in\\nfuture get his consent before taking on or dismissing any em-\\nployees; and, finally, that the control and disposal of all “secret\\nexpenses” be entrusted solely to him. In conclusion, he solemnly\\nannounced that he was offering these terms on behalf of the\\ntrade union.\\n\\n“But Kuei Chang-lin’s also a committee member of the trade\\nunion, isn’t he?” Tu Wei-yueh asked with a sarcastic smile,\\nmaking no comment on the demands. The policy he had decided\\non was to prolong the negotiations as much as possible to give\\nhimself more time for his own preparations and arrangements.\\nChien Pao-sheng’s swarthy face creased angrily.\\n\\n“Committee member my foot!” he exploded, crashing his fist\\non the table. “Well, all right, he is a committee member, but\\nnobody takes any notice of him! He’s bloody useless! He’s only\\none of half a dozen committee members, and anyway he’s just\\na windbag! Me, I represent the majority!”\\n\\n“Don’t fly off the handle, Pao-sheng!” put in Pockmarked Li,\\nholding down the fist with which Chien Pao-sheng had been\\npounding the table. “Let’s be peaceable about it and talk things\\nover properly!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh smiled calmly and changed the subject. ‘“Let’s\\nleave it at that then! It’s up to the union to settle its own\\naffairs. All we’re concerned with at this moment is the factory.\\nMr. Wu has made today the deadline for the end of the strike.\\n\\nNow we\\'re all in this together, and it’s up to every one of us\\nto pull together. Before we do anything else, we must talk the\\ngirls round and get the factory going again without delay. Be-\\nsides, with this general strike of all the silk factories in Shanghai,\\nit’s a very tricky situation, and one more day’s delay might be\\ndisastrous. I can’t imagine you trade union people wanting to\\nsee us involved in really serious trouble! If there is any really\\nserious trouble, you would have to take some of the responsibility\\nfor it. So let’s discuss first how we\\'re going to ensure a full-\\nscale return to work.”\\n\\n“That’s right!’ said Pockmarked Li to keep the conversation\\ngoing, when he saw that Chien Pao-sheng had no reply ready.\\n“Let’s get the strike over and done with first of all!”\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh’s eyes moved swiftly from one side to the other,\\nand again he quickly changed the subject.\\n\\n“Pao-sheng,” he said calmly, “I find your terms quite reasonable\\nand I think we could easily reach agreement on them. That\\nlittle performance of yours this morning, though, was a bit hard\\nto swallow, and you’ve succeeded in putting everybody’s back\\nup with it. If Mr. Wu got to hear of it, there’d be hell to pay.\\nI’ve warned them not to let on to him about it, because I think\\nwe can settle it between ourselves. Let’s agree once and for all\\nthat there won\\'t be a repeat performance of this morning’s un-\\npleasant business. It doesn’t look at all well when we start\\nfighting among ourselves, and it wrecks our chances of calling off\\nthe strike!”\\n\\n“What do you mean! That’s slander!” exclaimed Chien Pao-\\nsheng. His expression was indignant and he made as if to thump\\nthe table again; but, behind this facade of righteous indignation,\\nit was obvious that he was a little cowed and alarmed. Seeing\\nthrough him immediately, and realizing that his own diplomacy\\nwas winning him the upper hand, Tu Wei-yueh calmly pressed\\nhis advantage.\\n\\n“How can you say I’m slandering you? Quite a few of our\\npeople were knocked about. Look at Li’s nose! Isn’t that proof\\nenough?”\\n\\n“That’s because you got so many people in from outside without\\nnotifying me in advance. When you get so many people together\\n\\nlike that without letting me know what you\\'re doing, a few of\\nthem are bound to get hurt in the confusion.”\\n\\n“The reason why we got people in was to prevent the girls\\npicketing—”\\n\\n“And my chaps were also there to prevent picketing! They\\nwere only there to help out!”\\n\\n“It’s no use hedging! We\\'ve got Ah Hsiang as a witness that\\nit was your people that started it! While our men were dealing\\nwith the pickets, yours came along and went for them and started\\na fight!”\\n\\n“Ah Hsiang’s talking a lot of rot!” Chien Pao-sheng roared\\nthrough clenched teeth; beads of sweat stood out on his forehead.\\nHe paused a moment, then suddenly changed his tone.\\n\\n“What’s done can’t be undone: why keep harping on it? Now\\nlet me put it to you straight out: do you agree to my terms or\\ndon’t you? Let’s have it straight, with no more beating about\\nthe bush! The union’s waiting for me to give them a definite\\nanswer!”\\n\\n“But first we must have your word for it that we won\\'t have\\na repeat performance of the nonsense we had this morning! It’s\\nnot that I’m afraid of anything myself, but all this fighting among\\nourselves makes us look ridiculous outside. Besides, it’s just\\nplaying into the hands of the trouble-makers!”\\n\\n“All right then, but only if you\\'ll agree not to call in people\\nfrom outside any more!”\\n\\n“We have to call people in to prevent the women picketing\\nand stirring up trouble! We can\\'t do anything else! Am I right,\\nLi?”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s quite right. You’ve got nothing to worry about,\\nPao-sheng; all these chaps were called in by me, so there’s no\\ndanger of their going against you!”\\n\\n“Of course there isn’t! What Li says is clear enough! That’s\\nsettled, then: no more nonsense like we had this morning! All\\nright, Pao-sheng, you’d better go and tell your men about it\\nnow. Once you’ve sent them away, and Mr. Wu’s here, I’ll tell\\nhim your terms, and then they can be discussed properly.”\\n\\nBy seizing this opportunity to clinch the matter, Tu Wei-yueh\\nhad now managed to put off the discussion of Chien Pao-sheng’s\\nterms. He was helped out by a word from Pockmarked Li.\\n\\n“That\\'s right, Pao-sheng, you go and tell your chaps now that\\nthere’s to be no more trouble, so that Mr. Tu can set his mind\\nat rest.”\\n\\n“There’s no need to tell them: they won\\'t lift a finger till I give\\nthem the word!” Chien Pao-sheng assured him, tapping his\\nchest confidently. No sooner were the words out of his mouth\\nthan a sudden uproar was heard in the distance. Tu Wei-yueh\\nlooked alarmed and sprang to his feet. There was a patter of\\nfootsteps outside the window, and Mo Kan-cheng burst into the\\nroom.\\n\\n“They—they’re at it again!” he stuttered.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh gave Chien Pao-sheng a withering look as much\\nas to say, “So you’re stirring up trouble again!” Kicking his chair\\naside, he dashed out of the room. His face flushed, Pockmarked\\nLi also sprang up and grabbed Chien Pao-sheng by the arm.\\n\\n“Pao-sheng!” he protested angrily, his lips flecked with saliva.\\n“This is a bit too thick! It’s the limit!”\\n\\nChien Pao-sheng was speechless with rage. He also graspeo\\nPockmarked Li’s arm, and the two of them, still holding on to\\neach other, hurried out of the room. As they ran, Chien Pao-\\nsheng at last managed to say something, “Let’s go and see! Let’s\\nsee what’s happening!... The bloody idiots!”\\n\\nThey ran for all they were worth and soon caught up with\\nTu Wei-yueh. In the distance they could see a vast crowd out-\\nside the gate, milling round and roaring their heads off. When\\nthe three of them got to the gate and saw what was going on,\\nthey yelped with alarm and their faces paled: they were con-\\nfronted by a crowd of girls like so many enraged tigresses! The\\nthree of them immediately wheeled round and started to run, but\\nit was too late. They were swept off their feet by an angry\\nflood that swept up to the gate, and swallowed up in the crowd.\\nAnother wave of women came screaming up the street and hurled\\nitself on the one in front, so that the thin line of defenders in\\nfront of the gate began to give under the pressure. And as these\\nshock-troops pressed forward, their shrill slogans rent the air:\\n\\n“Join the general strike! Join the genera) strike!”\\n\\n“Only blacklegs go back!”\\n\\n“Shut down your machines and come and join us!”\\n\\nThe thin defence line now fell back, and the girls swept for-\\nward like a prairie-fire. They surged in through the narrow\\nside gate and also burst open the main gate. It all happened\\nwith the speed of lightning and with cataclysmic violence. But\\njust as suddenly, a crowd of men charged in upon the women\\nfrom one side and cut their ranks in two like a pair of shears\\ncutting through a piece of cloth. It was Kuei Chang-lin arriving\\nin the nick of time with a squad of policemen. Their whistles\\nshrilled above the roar of the crowd. There was a volley of\\nwarning shots over the heads of the crowd, then another volley,\\nthis time in real earnest! The defenders inside the gate now\\nbegan a counter-attack. There was nothing the women inside\\ncould do now but make a retreat. They surged out through the\\ngate on to the street again, sweeping aside Kuei Chang-lin and\\nthe policemen as they went.\\n\\n“After ’em!” roared Kuei Chang-lin. “Don’t let ’em get away!”\\n\\nJust then, whistles began to shrill from every direction as more\\npolicemen arrived on the scene from the various police stations\\nin the neighbourhood and began to round up the women. Kuei\\nChang-lin and his squad of police made straight for the workers’\\nslum. They swept through it from end to end, leaving the claw-\\nmarks of terrorism behind each rickety bamboo door. They\\ncaught a couple of dozen girls and drove over two hundred from\\nthe slum to the factory, where they herded them into the\\nworkshop.\\n\\nTu Wei-yueh and Chien Pao-sheng had both been injured in\\nthe fray. A couple of stray bullets had hit Chien Pao-sheng in\\nthe leg and deprived him of a chunk of his greasy hide. Yet he\\nwas grateful to Kuei Chang-lin for coming in the nick of time\\nand saving his life.\\n\\nIn Tu Wei-yueh’s bedroom, an elated Kuei Chang-lin said,\\n“More than three hundred girls back at work! Just listen to\\nthose machines! And we’ve caught Ho Hsiju-mei and Chang\\nAh-hsin, too. We roped in a dozen or so more while we were\\nat it. It won\\'t hurt them to cool their heels in jail for a few days,\\neven if some of them are not in the wrong! Those bitches who\\nrushed the gate—they didn’t give a damn what happened to\\nthem, anyway! Besides, most of them weren\\'t our girls at all:\\n\\nthey came in from other factories!... By the way, Mr. Tu, how\\ndid you get on with Chien Pao-sheng?”\\n\\n“We’ve come out on top!” said Tu Wei-yueh with a smile of\\nsatisfaction. “Chang-lin, you can go and ring up Mr. Wu and\\ntell him!”\\n\\nA thought suddenly struck him: there was still someone whose\\nwhereabouts he wanted to check on, but before he could ask he\\nfelt a sudden twinge of pain where he had been wounded. His\\nface turned pale and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He\\ngritted his teeth in silence.\\n\\n*\\n\\nSo one of the strongest links in the chain of the general strike\\nof silk filatures was broken! It was around seven o’clock in the\\nevening, and the gathering darkness brought with it the prospect\\nof the general strike collapsing. The slum where the factory girls\\nlived was under close surveillance and was now as silent as\\nthe grave. A glimpse of a girl’s pale face in the gloom or the\\nsound of a low moan breaking the stillness of the breathless\\nevening air was enough to alert the watching policemen, and\\nthen shouts and the noise of running feet would shatter the\\nsepulchral silence for a moment.\\n\\nFrom a dark corner of the slum a shadow was creeping silently\\nout, like a thieving little dog nosing around, trying to find\\nan unguarded break in the police cordon. Overhead, stars were\\ntwinkling in the deep blue of the sky. A faint breeze stirred and\\nwafted the frightened crying of a child from somewhere in the\\nslum. A blast on a police-whistle! ...With slow but purposeful\\nmovements the shadow stole forward until it was finally outside\\nthe police cordon. Now its movements became swifter, and the\\ntwinkling stars watched it dart from one patch of cover to an-\\nother and finally turn into a squalid alleyway. It gave three\\ntaps on the back door of the end house. The door opened a few\\ninches, and the shadow slipped inside.\\n\\nIn the front room upstairs were three rickety beds with no\\nmosquito nets and a single square table. The fifteen-watt light\\nshone on a girl lying on a bed under the window and another\\ngirl sitting beside her. They were talking in an undertone. The\\ngirl on the chair suddenly jerked her head round and exclaimed:\\n\\n“Ah, Yueh-ngo!... Nobody with you?”\\n\\n“Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin have been arrested. Didn\\'t\\nyou know?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I mean where’s Chu—what’s her name, Chu Kuei-\\nying, isn’t it? The one who’s just joined. Why didn’t she come\\nwith you?”\\n\\n“I just couldn’t get to her. It was as much as I could do to\\nget here myself. They’ve got people watching all round the huts.”\\n\\nChen Yueh-ngo shook her head and spat, then sat down at the\\ntable, poured herself out a cup of tea, and sat there sipping at it.\\nThe girl on the bed patted her companion on the shoulder. “Just\\nwhat happened in Hongkew! You know, Ma Chin, I’m afraid\\nthis general strike’s fizzling out again!”\\n\\nMa Chin snorted angrily but made no reply. She fixed her\\nvivid black eyes on Chen Yueh-ngo’s face and saw that she looked\\nlistless, or rather, dazed and frustrated by this latest setback.\\nFeeling Ma Chin’s eye on her, she put down her cup and asked\\nanxiously, “What are we going to do about it, then? Hurry up\\nand tell me, do!”\\n\\n“Wait until Ke Tso-fu comes, and then we\\'ll have a discussion.\\n—Tsai Chen, what’s the time? What’s keeping Ke Tso-fu, I\\nwonder? No sign of Su Lun, either.”\\n\\n“Twenty past seven,” replied Tsai Chen, rolling over cum-\\nbrously on the bed and sitting up. “I can’t wait much longer.\\nI’ve got a meeting in Hongkew at half past eight! Oh bother!”\\nShe suddenly threw her arms round Ma Chin and began gently\\nworrying her neck with her teeth. Ma Chin freed herself im-\\npatiently and reproved Tsai Chen good-humouredly:\\n\\n“What d\\'you think you’re doing? Nymphomaniac!—By the way,\\nYueh-ngo, what’s the ‘fighting spirit’ of the girls in your factory\\nlike? All right? Most of the girls here in Chapei are firm\\nenough. This morning, as soon as they heard that some of the\\ngirls in your factory had gone back to work, they set out at once\\nof their own accord to break into your factory. So long as the\\ngirls in your factory can remain firm, the general strike can still\\ngo on. It makes things very awkward to have your girls going\\nback unconditionally just now! If we should fail completely\\nthis time, there wouldn’t be much point in trying again!”\\n\\n“We\\'re not finished yet by any means!” Tsai Chen put in\\nquickly. “Now listen, Ma Chin! I suggest we go out tonight\\n\\nand make a great effort to mobilize as many girls as possible to\\nbreak into the factories again tomorrow! Backs to the wall this\\ntime! Even if we fail, it’ll be a glorious failure!... Yes, on\\nsecond thoughts, Ma Chin, I think we should go back to what\\nI suggested in the first place: we should consider no sacrifice\\ntoo great, and we should be prepared for a glorious failure!”\\n\\nSo saying, Tsai Chen ran across to Chen Yueh-ngo, threw her\\narms round her, and pressed her cheek against hers. Chen Yueh-\\nngo blushed furiously and twisted away from her in embarrass-\\nment. Tsai Chen went off into peals of hysterical laughter and\\nthrew herself back on the bed, where she tossed up and down\\nuntil the bedstead creaked in protest.\\n\\n“Be quiet, Tsai Chen!” said Ma Chin, gently reproachful.\\n“Glorious failure, eh? Hm!”\\n\\nShe sat down at the table and began questioning Chen Yueh-\\nngo closely about the events in the factory, but they had not\\ngot very far when two men came into the room, one after the\\nother. The one in front sat himself down with a bump on the\\nedge of the table; he fished out a pocket-watch, glanced at it,\\nthen began rapping out orders:\\n\\n“It\\'s half past seven already! Come on, look alive! Ma Chin:\\nStop your conversation! Tsai Chen: Get up! You all look half\\nasleep!”\\n\\n“you\\'re late yourself, Tso-fu!” protested Tsai Chen, spring-\\ning off the bed. “Come on, don’t waste time! Ma Chin! Yueh-\\nngo! I\\'ll have to leave here for a meeting in Hongkew at half\\npast eight!”\\n\\nShe sat down beside Ke Tso-fu. He was young—still in his\\ntwenties—slightly taller than Tsai Chen, and with a thin, pale\\nface which was remarkable only for the thin, tightly-compressed\\nlips suggestive of his strength of will. The other young man was\\nrather on the plump side; his eyes were alert, though edged with\\nwrinkles of tiredness. He grinned at Ma Chin and sat down\\nbeside her.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the room at once became tense as they sat\\ndown together beneath the dim light of the fifteen-watt bulb.\\nKe Tso-fu spoke first to the other young man:\\n\\n“Your work’s nowhere near up to scratch, Su Lun! The way\\nyou conducted that meeting of activists from the silk factories\\n\\nthis afternoon was all wrong! You don’t seem able to seize on\\nthe revolutionary spirit of the masses and lead them on from\\none struggle to another and to develop the struggle further\\nand further! Your leadership is tinged with rightism: you\\'re\\njust marking time and even tailing along behind the masses!\\nNow that the general strike of the silk factories has reached a\\ncritical stage, the first thing we must do is to overcome this sort\\nof tailism! Ma Chin, let’s hear your report on the work in\\nChapei!”\\n\\n“Oh, hurry up!” urged Tsai Chen, drumming her pencil on the\\ntable. “Make it as short as you can, because I’m off to the\\nmeeting at half past eight!”\\n\\nMa Chin spoke for about five minutes. Her manner was calm,\\nand she made one main point: as a result of harsher measures\\nfrom the employers, they had suffered drastic losses of progres-\\nsive elements among the workers, so that their footing among\\nthe masses was now weaker. Ke Tso-fu listened to her with an\\nair of impatience, glancing now and then at his watch; his thin\\nlips were pressed together tighter than ever.\\n\\n“I disagree with Ma Chin’s conclusion!” broke in Tsai Chen,\\nglancing quickly across at Su Lun. “The longer the struggle,\\nthe more new progressive elements will be produced, and the\\nstronger our footing among the masses will be! Ma Chin’s timid\\nattitude is a sign of tailism!”\\n\\nShe was now fully determined to push the first suggestion that\\nshe had made that evening. Just because this ordinary-looking\\nyoung man Ke Tso-fu always began by accusing people of\\nrightism or tailism, she felt that he must be right in whatever\\nhe said.\\n\\nKe Tso-fu was silent, and his lips were closed tighter than\\never. As usual, he was waiting to the last before drawing his\\nconclusions and giving his orders.\\n\\nSu Lun, who had had the glance shot at him by Tsai Chen,\\nnevertheless supported Ma Chin’s view. He naturally did not\\nadmit his “tailism,” but adopted an easy-going manner.\\n\\n“while Tsai Chen deals in theories,” he said, “Ma Chin bases\\nherself on facts. And facts are one thing we shouldn\\'t overlook.\\nTso-fu says I made mistakes at the activists’ meeting this after-\\nnoon: all right, I admit that I did make mistakes. But the fact\\n\\nremains that today’s activists’ meeting was a flop right from the\\nstart! Only half the expected number of delegates turned up,\\nand the progress reports were unrealistic and largely irrelevant.\\n—And those who spoke in the discussion that followed were ram-\\nbling and incoherent. This meeting’s clearly exposed the in-\\ncompetence of our junior cadres in leading the masses! If I’ve\\nbeen guilty of tailism, our present junior cadres as a whole are\\ntailists as well! And Tsai Chen and Ma Chin, who are actually\\norganizing the strikes, are just tailing along behind the junior\\ncadres!”\\n\\n“What right have you to say I’m tailing along behind!—”\\n\\n“Don’t talk nonsense!” snapped Ma Chin. “Let’s get a move\\non and decide on a course of action! I expect Chen Yueh-ngo’s\\ngot something to say!”\\n\\nBy saying this she had warded off a dispute between Tsai\\nChen and Su Lun and at the same time brought Chen Yueh-ngo\\nto Ke Tso-fu’s notice. Ke Tso-fu turned his head slightly and\\nlooked expectantly at Chen Yueh-ngo.\\n\\n“I wish you’d hurry up and tell me what to do,” said Chen\\nYueh-ngo. “The other two comrades in my factory have been\\narrested, and there’s only me left now! The girls—the girls only\\nwent back today because they were forced to by the police! If\\nonly we can think of a good way, we can get them out on strike\\nagain tomorrow! I’m just waiting for you to tell me what to do!”\\n\\nChen Yueh-ngo looked agitated and also very excited. It was\\nobvious that she was perplexed by all the “technical terms”\\nused by Ke Tso-fu and Su Lun, and that she had plenty of ideas\\nbut could not find the right words. She only felt that Ma Chin\\nwas right, for hadn’t their position been weakened by the arrest\\nof Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin? On the other hand, she\\ndared not disagree with what Tsai Chen had said, for she had\\na vague feeling that Tsai Chen’s words were quotations from rev-\\nolutionary classics. Now that she had said as much as she\\ncould find words for—though even that had been difficult—she\\nremained gazing at Ke Tso-fu with anxious eyes.\\n\\nKe Tso-fu’s lean, ordinary-looking face suddenly took on a\\nsevere expression. He glanced once more at his watch, then said\\nfirmly:\\n\\n“Tonight, you all go out and work harder than ever to heighten\\nthe fighting spirit of the masses and ensure that they don’t return\\nto work tomorrow! This applies especially to the Yu Hua Factory:\\nthe girls there must come out on strike again tomorrow! What-\\never happens, you must overcome all difficulties and have them\\nout again tomorrow! Give the masses these slogans: ‘Oppose\\nCapitalists Using Hooligans!’ and ‘Oppose Capitalists Arresting\\nWorkers!”\\n\\nFor a moment there was silence. From the alleyway outside\\ncame the “tock-tock!” of a dumpling-pedlar striking his bamboo\\ntube. In a neighbouring house a baby was crying. The dim\\nyellow light of the fifteen-watt bulb flickered overhead. Ma\\nChin’s calm voice broke the silence.\\n\\n“We\\'ve almost completely lost our foothold among the girls of\\nthe Yu Hua Factory, and the masses are under close surveillance\\nby the police. Until we\\'ve made some readjustment, we shouldn’t\\ntake chances!”\\n\\n“What do you mean, ‘readjustment’? At a time like this, when\\nthe fate of the general strike is in the balance, there’s no time\\nfor any leisurely readjustments! The only time we\\'ve got left\\nfor readjustments is tonight, and tonight we’ve got to mobilize\\nnew fighting elements so that we can launch a new offensive!”\\n\\n“But we can never do it in one night!’ contended Ma Chin\\nfirmly, her dark eyes flashing round the circle of faces. “Our\\norganization among the workers has been completely wrecked,\\nand the enemy has the workers under strict surveillance—no,\\nwe shouldn\\'t risk it! If we insist on going forward with a new\\noffensive under the present circumstances, it\\'ll be suppressed im-\\nmediately, and then what little foothold we still have left will\\nbe completely destroyed!”\\n\\nKe Tso-fu sat tight-lipped and silent, adamant as ever. It\\nbegan to look as if a deadlock had been reached. Tsai Chen\\nsuddenly made a sound in her throat as if she were going to\\nspeak, but said nothing. Her “second proposal,” which had been\\npushed to the back of her mind, was now forcing its way to\\nthe front again and struggling with her “first proposal,” on which\\nshe had set her mind. She was biting her lips, which were\\ndrawn back with tension. Chen Yueh-ngo was waiting, her eyes\\n\\nwide with worry. Su Lun now intervened in an effort to break\\nthe deadlock.\\n\\n“Ma Chin, tell us what you think we ought to do!”\\n\\n“IT don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t make a slight\\nmodification in the alignment of the general strike. In the\\nfactories where it is possible to keep the workers out on strike,\\nwe should fight as hard as we can. That’s only natural. But in\\nthe factories where we have suffered serious losses we shouldn\\'t\\nrun any more risks; we should give the girls a rest to recuperate.\\nWe should then go all out to make a readjustment and get them\\nproperly organized. In other words, we should conserve our\\nstrength until a suitable opportunity presents itself, and then we\\ncan—”\\n\\nBefore Ma Chin had a chance to finish, Ke Tso-fu interrupted\\nher with a stern reproof. “Your proposal is tantamount to call-\\ning off the general strike! It’s beating a cowardly retreat at a\\ncritical stage in the high tide of the revolution! It’s rightism!”\\n\\n“Yes, Ma Chin,” Tsai Chen quickly chimed in as her “first pro-\\nposal” got the upper hand again. “You want to break the ranks\\nof the general strike on the one hand, but on the other you’re\\nexpecting the girls in the other factories to hold out! The two\\nthings don’t tie up!”\\n\\nMa Chin’s face flushed crimson, and she went on resolutely,\\n“What do you mean, ‘don’t tie up’? It\\'ll work out in practice\\nall right! To take a risk like this would be suicidal!”\\n\\n“If only we can find a good way,” put in Chen Yueh-ngo with\\na glance at Ma Chin, “we can get our factory out on strike again\\ntomorrow. The only thing is, there are not many of our people\\nleft now, and the masses are afraid of further oppression. If\\nthe same old method is used again, we’ll never get anywhere!\\nSo I think the most important thing is to find a good new\\nmethod!”\\n\\nIt had cost Chen Yueh-ngo a great deal of effort to find words\\nto express what she wanted to say, but neither Ke Tso-fu nor\\nTsai Chen paid the slightest attention to her. Su Lun, who\\nagreed with Ma Chin and also understood what Chen Yueh-ngo\\nwas trying to say, made another attempt to resolve the deadlock.\\n\\n“What Yueh-ngo says is based on actual facts! By a good new\\nmethod she means a change in our tactics—isn’t that so, Yueh-\\n\\nngo? Let me make a proposal: since the organization of the girls\\nin the Yu Hua Factory has been so badly damaged that it requires\\na readjustment which will take longer than one night to carry out,\\nwe should allow one more day for this, so that we can bring them\\nout again the day after tomorrow. This would mean that the\\nover-all alignment of the general strike would remain intact.”\\n\\n“No, no!’ protested Tsai Chen vehemently. “If we don’t go\\non fighting tomorrow with still greater forces, the general strike\\nwill fizzle out! If the workers at the Yu Hua remain at work\\ntomorrow, the workers at all the other factories will begin to\\nwaver!”\\n\\nUnable to contain herself any longer, Ma Chin burst out ac-\\nrimoniously, “If this general strike can fizzle out as easily as\\nall that, then it’s obvious that it’s premature!—It’s putschism!\\nAdventurism!”\\n\\nAt this, Ke Tso-fu scowled. He brought both his hands down\\nwith a thump on the table and snapped Ma Chin’s head off:\\n\\n“Ma Chin! You\\'re criticizing the Party line! This rightist\\ndeviation of yours is very serious! The Party is determined to do\\naway with all such rightist views! If the girls at the Yu Hua\\nFactory don’t come out on strike again tomorrow, it will be a\\ncase of undermining the general strike and disobeying the Party\\nline! The Party would have to apply strict disciplinary measures!”\\n\\n“But in actual practice,” countered Ma Chin, “it just amounts\\nto giving more comrades into the enemy’s hands. What do you\\nsay to that?”\\n\\nShe was still adamant; her face was flushed, but her lips were\\nbloodless. Ke Tso-fu snarled and pounded the table. “Now I\\'m\\nwarning you, Ma Chin! The Party has iron disciplinet No\\nParty member is permitted to disobey orders! You will go at\\nonce with Chen Yueh-ngo and mobilize the women for tomorrow’s\\nstruggle! Whatever the costs, it must be done! That’s an order!”\\n\\nMa Chin hung her head in silence. Ke Tso-fu gave her a\\nwithering look and turned to Tsai Chen and Su Lun. “You\\'ll\\nhave to put the pressure on in Hongkew, Tsai Chen! You must\\ncarry out all orders with firmness and purge all rightist views!\\nSu Lun, I want you now to tell the girls what important resolu-\\ntions on the general strike were passed by the general strike\\ncommittee!”\\n\\nWith this, Ke Tso-fu glanced at his watch once more, then\\nstood up and took his departure.\\n\\nFor a moment, none of the people left in the little room spoke.\\nTsai Chen stretched, then turned and threw herself heavily on\\nthe bed again, making it creak noisily. Su Lun sat gazing up\\nat the light bulb with a faint smile on his lips. Chen Yueh-ngo\\nwas staring anxiously at Ma Chin. Out in the lane two men\\nwere quarrelling, and a dog was barking.\\n\\nMa Chin lifted her head and smiled at Chen Yueh-ngo, then\\nturned to the recumbent Tsai Chen. “Come on, Tsai Chen!\\nWe\\'ve got our orders—‘at all costs it must be done!’ Now, let’s\\nshare out the work between us. Come on, buck up your ideas!\\nIt’s getting late!”\\n\\n“Oh dear!” exclaimed Tsai Chen, springing off the bed. “I\\'ve\\ngot my meeting in Hongkew at half past eight! It’s nearly eight\\nalready!” She rushed across the room, hit Su Lun, who seemed\\nto be dozing off, on the head in passing, and flung herself on\\nMa Chin.\\n\\n“Oh, Ma Chin!” she gasped in her ear. “There’s a lump in\\nmy heart, as if it’s going to explode, something that’s going to\\nburst out and burn all our enemies! I’d just like to get my hands\\non an enemy and shoot him dead! Feel my face, feel how it’s\\nburning!... Never mind, though, let’s divide up the work, Ma\\nChint”\\n\\nIgnoring Tsai Chen, Ma Chin turned away and addressed Chen\\nYueh-ngo in a stern voice:\\n\\n“You go back now, Yueh-ngo, and go and see Chu Kuei-ying\\nand any other close friends that you have and tell them that the\\ngirls in all the other factories in Hongkew and Chapei are deter-\\nmined not to go back to work, and that if the girls at the Yu\\nHua Factory go in to work again tomorrow, the girls from alli\\nthe other factories will come and break in. When all the other\\nfactories are out on strike to back up your factory, it wouldn’t\\nbe playing the game if your girls went back now! If only you\\ncan hold out for a day or two longer, your boss will have to\\ngive in! Now go and do your best to stir up the girls, Yueh-ngo,\\nand don’t even think about failing! Ill come and see you in\\nhalf an hour. It’s now—er—eight o’clock. I’ll make it half past\\neight at the latest. You be waiting for me at your place. And\\n\\nmind you don’t make a hash of it! Afterwards, we\\'ll go to the\\ngeneral strike representatives’ meeting together.”\\n\\n“That’s right!” Tsai Chen put in hurriedly. “Both of you be\\nat the inn at half past nine. There’s no need to get there earlier.\\nI won’t get there with the representatives from Hongkew until\\nthen, anyway.”\\n\\nShe skipped away from them, gaily humming a tune.\\n\\n“Right, then! Everything’s settled! Though there are still the\\nrepresentatives from the other Chapei factories that Ah Ying’s\\ngoing to contact; they may get there a few minutes early. Still,\\nthey can wait there. Now, come on, Yueh-ngo, you should be\\ngone! You too, Tsai Chen, you\\'d better not hang about any\\nlonger! Remember—half past nine, general strike representatives’\\nmeeting! I\\'ll still be here for a while yet. If Ah Ying doesn’t\\nturn up in the next quarter of an hour, she won\\'t be here at all.\\nStill, we can always see her at the meeting.”\\n\\n“Hang on a minute, Tsai Chen!” Su Lun said hurriedly, fishing\\nout a piece of paper from his pocket. “Here are the resolutions\\nof the general strike committee for you to pass on to the repre-\\nsentatives’ meeting.”\\n\\nBut Tsai Chen was in a great hurry to be off. She snatched\\nthe piece of paper from Su Lun, glanced at it, then tossed it back\\nto Su Lun. She grabbed Chen Yueh-ngo’s hand and threw over her\\nshoulder. “I can’t read your spidery scrawl! You\\'ll have to tell\\nMa Chin what it’s about! Come on, Yueh-ngo, let’s go! Mm, I\\ndo love you!”\\n\\nOnly Ma Chin and Su Lun were now left in the room. It took\\nthem five minutes to go through the resolutions of the general\\nstrike committee, and then they relapsed into silence. Ma Chin\\nwas pacing slowly up and down, her face wrinkled with concen-\\ntration. Suddenly she began muttering to herself and slowly\\nnodding her head.\\n\\n“Yes, we must certainly take the offensive, but we must def-\\ninitely look after our rear as well. I must think of a way to keep\\nwhat little footing we still have in the Yu Hua!”\\n\\nSu Lun turned and watched her face for a moment, then\\ngrinned and said quietly in an imitation of Ke Tso-fu’s voice,\\n“I\\'m warning you, Ma Chin!... Whatever the cost, it must be\\ndone! That’s an order!”\\n\\n“Oh, shut up, you clown!” she muttered, coming to a halt. “You\\nneedn\\'t be funny about it!” She smiled, but Su Lun suddenly\\nbecame serious; he heaved a sharp sigh and said grimly:\\n\\n“Frankly, I feel the same as you do about all this rushing blindly\\nahead and ignoring the risk. Doesn’t seem right. But what can\\nyou do about it? The moment you come out with a different\\nopinion, you\\'re called a right-wing opportunist, a liquidationist!\\nAnd then some little tin god swats you with his ‘orders’! Com-\\nmandism, that’s what it is!”\\n\\nMa Chin glanced at Su Lun with her lively but gentle eyes,\\nas if she sympathized with him. Su Lun was something of a\\n“theorist,” and had “the gift of the gab.” She had always looked\\nup to him in a way, but at this moment she suddenly felt that\\nhe was somehow even more imposing than ever—clear-minded,\\nable to speak without relying on “formulas,” always smiling that\\nintelligent smile of his, and always calm and sensible. Apart\\nfrom the respect she had always had for him, she now felt her\\nheart warming to him as well.\\n\\n“J wonder what’s keeping Ah Ying away,” she said, changing\\nthe subject. “It looks as if she won’t be coming tonight.”\\n\\nShe went across and lay down on the bed under the window.\\nHer face was still turned towards Su Lun, and her thoughtful,\\ntender eyes were still on him.\\n\\nSu Lun followed her across, his eyes never leaving her for a\\nmoment. Suddenly he laughed. “I\\'m perfectly certain Ah Ying\\nwon’t be coming here tonight: she’s too busy with all the over-\\ntime she’s been putting in lately!”\\n\\n“What do you mean, ‘overtime’?”\\n\\nSu Lun sat down on the edge of the bed, his lips parted in a\\ngrin. Ma Chin smiled and asked, “What are you laughing at?”\\n\\n“Because you don’t understand what I mean by ‘overtime.\\n\\nMa Chin jerked round on the bed and gave Su Lun a strange\\nlook, then said quite casually, “Don’t start a rumour!”\\n\\n“But I’m not! Haven’t you noticed how thin she’s getting just\\nlately? And haven’t you noticed that Tsai Chen’s losing weight,\\ntoo? It’s the same reason in both cases: the demands of sex\\nand the demands of the revolution both taking their toll at the\\nsame time!”\\n\\nyo\\n\\nMa Chin laughed and shook her head disbelievingly. Su Lun\\nedged closer and said, “Li Pa’s been looking for you all over the\\nplace again today!”\\n\\n“The man’s a nuisance!”\\n\\n“He says he’s going to arrange for you to work at his place and\\n‘live in on the job.’ He\\'s trying to persuade Tso-fu to transfer\\nyou!”\\n\\n“Humph! The man’s more of a nuisance than I thought!”\\n\\n‘Why don’t you love him?”\\n\\nMa Chin gave another laugh but did not answer him. After a\\nmoment, Su Lun heaved a sigh and said, “Since Little Wang left\\nShanghai she’s deserted me!”\\n\\nMa Chin laughed and squirmed round on the bed, then looked\\nup into Su Lun’s plump face and said teasingly, “I suppose you’ve\\nbeen feeling pretty low just lately, then?”\\n\\n“Well, it’s only natural that I should feel rather put out—”\\n\\nMa Chin laughed herself into a fit of coughing. She undid her\\ntop button, still laughing and coughing at the same time.\\n\\n“I can’t help feeling rather put out about it, Ma Chin, now can\\nI? I know we shouldn’t take these love affairs too seriously, but\\nI can’t help feeling rather put out, all the same. It’s the same\\nwith all these comrades we\\'ve lost lately: I know they were\\nmartyrs for the cause, yet it always makes me feel rather miser-\\nable to think about it!”\\n\\nSu Lun’s head drooped as he spoke; Ma Chin was still laughing.\\n\\n“tat Ha! You\\'re not a revolutionary, Su Lun: you’ve turned\\ninto a little girl!”\\n\\n“You know, Ma Chin, sometimes I really do feel like a little\\ngirl! Ma Chin, I need someone to comfort me, someone to en-\\ncourage me. Would you, Ma Chin? I need—”\\n\\nSu Lun Hfted his head. He grasped Ma Chin’s hand in his and\\nat the same time pressed his face to hers. Ma Chin did not move,\\nbut gave a suppressed giggle. Su Lun now pressed his lips to\\nhers and began kissing her in earnest. She swayed slightly, then\\ngiggled again.\\n\\n“What nice, firm little breasts you have, Ma Chin!”\\n\\nMa Chin giggled even more excitedly, then suddenly rolled over,\\npushed Su Lun away and sprang off the bed.\\n\\n“tt’s getting late! I must be off to see Yueh-ngo!—”\\n\\nSu Lun had stealthily put his arms round her again, and again\\nshe pushed him away. She ran across the room to one of the\\nother beds and picked up her “working girl’s clothes,” but before\\nshe could put them on, Su Lun suddenly threw himself on\\nher and grasped her so violently that they both fell on the bed.\\nMa Chin laughed and shouted:\\n\\n“No, no, you barbarian! I’ve got work to do!”\\n\\n“Work? Yes, the devil’s work! Commandism! Forging blindly\\nahead! I can see through it all!”\\n\\n“What can you see through?”\\n\\n“T can see well enough that our work is a waste of time! That\\nthe Party line is a suicidal policy, that our Soviet is a tourist\\nSoviet, that our Red Army is a robber-band brought up to date!\\n—Now come on, Ma Chin, you needn’t be so feudalistic. .. .”\\n\\nMa Chin suddenly snarled and thrust him savagely away, then\\nsprang to her feet, her eyes blazing with anger, and snapped:\\n\\n“How dare you say such a thing! You’re giving yourself away\\n—you\\'re tarred with the same brush as the liquidationists!”\\n\\nWith that she flew downstairs and out of the house to the\\nalleyway.\\n\\nAbove her head shimmered a star-studded sky. As she walked\\nalong, Ma Chin remembered her dispute with Ke Tso-fu and Su\\nLun’s beastly behaviour. She felt angry and resentful, but she\\ntried to forget these unpleasant things and concentrate her mind\\non one thing: her work, her mission. She was now approaching\\nthe workers’ slum. Very cautiously she slipped through the\\npolice cordon and made her way stealthily towards Chen Yueh-\\nngo’s hut. A dim figure appeared just ahead of her. She stopped\\nand slipped aside into the shadows, every sense alert and taut.\\nThe figure moved across to Chen Yueh-ngo’s hut and stopped.\\nThe bamboo door gave a muffled creak. Ma Chin realized what\\nit meant and went swiftly and softly across to the door. With\\na glance over her shoulder, she slipped inside.\\n\\nChen Yueh-ngo and Chu Kuei-ying were both there. A tiny\\nflame burnt in the oil lamp on the table. Stentorian snores came\\nfrom the shadows—Chen Yueh-ngo’s elder brother, a stevedore.\\nMa Chin asked them in a whisper, “Have you been round to them\\nall?”\\n\\n“Yes; fairly good results, too. They said that so long as the\\nothers come and break in they’ll all shut down their machines\\nand join them.” ,\\n\\nMa Chin frowned. She seemed to hear a noise outside the\\ndoor. The three girls cocked their heads on one side and listened\\nintently, but the noise was not repeated. Ma Chin then went\\non in an undertone, “Right, then, we’d better be off to the repre-\\nsentatives’ meeting! Though I\\'d like to go and have a chat with\\nsome of the girls first. You know which of them are reliable, so\\nyou can take me round!”\\n\\n“Not a chance!” whispered Chen Yueh-ngo in a scarcely audible\\nvoice. “We\\'re being too closely watched. The moment you move,\\nthey’re down on you like a shot!”\\n\\nBut Ma Chin was adamant and insisted that she should be\\ntaken round. Then Chu Kuei-ying tugged at Chen Yueh-ngo’s\\nsleeve. “Ill take her round,” she offered. “I’m not being\\nshadowed.”\\n\\n“You don’t realize it but you are! Chamber-pot Tu’s a sly\\none—too sly to overlook you! I think we\\'d better let Hsiao-mei\\ngo with Ma Chin.”\\n\\nAs she said this, Chen Yueh-ngo nudged Ma Chin to call her\\nattention to a little figure in the corner by the bamboo door.\\nIt was Chin Hsiao-mei, and when she heard that they wanted her\\nto take Ma Chin round, her eyes sparkled with delight. Ma\\nChin glanced at her and nodded her consent.\\n\\n“E{siao-mei won’t do, either,” objected Chu Kuei-ying. ‘“She’s\\na little chatterbox, and anyway she’s being watched by the police\\nas well!”\\n\\nMa Chin was getting impatient. “No more arguing! We\\'ll all\\ngo together! Kuei-ying, you go in front; Ill follow on three\\nor four yards behind you; and Chen Yueh-ngo can follow on the\\nsame distance behind me. Whoever finds herself being shadowed\\nwarns the rest of us!”\\n\\nThere were no more objections, and they set out. Not far away\\nfrom Chen Yueh-ngo’s hut there lived a girl who they thought\\nwas “progressive.” Chu Kuei-ying went in first, leaving the\\nbamboo door ajar. Just as Ma Chin was going to follow her\\nin, a shout suddenly rang out in the darkness:\\n\\n“What are you up to?”\\n\\nStartled, Chen Yueh-ngo turned and ran, but she was caught\\nand held almost at once. Then a police-whistle shrilled, and\\nPockmarked Li and Kuei Chang-lin came on the scene with\\ntheir men. They burst into the hut and seized everyone they\\ncould lay hands on. A commotion arose in the slum, but within\\nabout ten minutes all was quiet again. Then a bevy of smiling\\nforewomen came on the scene and went round the huts reassur-\\ning the startled girls:\\n\\n“There’s nothing to be afraid of! They’re only rounding up\\na few Communists! Just come in to work in the morning and\\neverything will be all right! Mr. Wu will soon make things\\nright with everybody!”\\nXVI\\n\\nIt was almost daylight before Chu Kuei-ying’s mother even-\\ntually began to calm down. She lay on her rickety bamboo cot\\nafter a night of weeping and cursing and frenziedly trailing up\\nand down the slum in search of her daughter. She had tried\\nseveral times to force her way into the factory to see Tu Wei-\\nyueh and risk her life if necessary. By now the old lady was\\nso exhausted that she could not stir an inch, yet she could not\\nget to sleep: she just lay there staring into space with her\\nbloodshot eyes. Her rage had now passed, and the icy fingers\\nof fear were clutching at her heart.\\n\\nThe oil lamp on the table had burnt down to the last drop of\\noil, and the flame sank lower and lower until it finally died.\\nOutside the bamboo door, a dull white gleam was gradually\\nspreading across the sky. It seemed to the old lady that a\\nghostly hand was pressing down on her chest and tearing at\\nher heart. She heard the bamboo door creak and looked round\\n—her daughter’s head, all bloody, was rolling across the floor\\ntowards her bed! She sprang up at once, but instead of her\\ndaughter’s head she now saw two figures standing before her.\\nShe peered through the gloom and when she saw that it was\\nher son Little San-tse and their next-door neighbour Chin Ho-\\nshang, she seemed suddenly relieved.\\n\\n“Have you found where they’ve locked her up?” she asked\\nquickly. “Wasn\\'t that her head that rolled in just now?”\\n\\n“Her head? Of course not! —Some say she’s been sent down\\nto the police station and some say she’s shut up in the factory—\\neverybody says something different! Blast ’em!”\\n\\nChin Ho-shang ground his teeth. There was a sudden clatter\\nas Little San-tse kicked a rickety stool out of the way and\\ngrunted savagely. His mother gaped for a moment, then went\\n\\noff into another fit of weeping and cursing, beating her chest\\nand stamping her feet.\\n\\nThe slum now began to stir into life, and the factory hooter\\nsounded its imperious summons. Hurried footsteps began pat-\\ntering past the door, mingled with shouts, laughter and curses,\\nas well as the smutty banter of the rowdies as they teased the\\npassing girls.\\n\\nSuddenly a tall, thin, rather attractive woman came into the\\nhut. When he saw that it was Yao Chin-feng, Little San-tse\\nsuddenly rounded his eyes and was just going to swear at her,\\nbut just then another girl came in behind her. It was Lu\\nHsiao-pao. She pulled him aside to the doorway and whispered,\\n“ve found out about Kuei-ying for you. She’s in the factory.\\nYou might be able to get round Mr. Tu to let her go.”\\n\\nBefore Little San-tse could make a reply, he heard Yao Chin-\\nfeng laughing and commenting loudly:\\n\\n“She only has herself to blame! Mr. Tu had his eye on her\\nonce, but she threw her chance away! Don’t worry, though:\\nYll put in a word for her! Mr. Tu’s a good chap at heart!\\nThough I’m afraid Kuei-ying will have to change her ideas—”\\n\\nBefore Yao Chin-feng could finish what she was saying, Little\\nSan-tse rushed across and grabbed hold of her, his eyes glaring\\nwith rage.\\n\\n“T\\'ll teach you to come smarming round us, you saucy bitch?’\\n\\nThe next moment the two of them were wrestling together.\\nThen Chin Ho-shang pulled Little San-tse off, while Lu Hsiao-\\npao dragged Yao Chin-feng away. As they went out the old\\nlady shouted after them.\\n\\n“It was you two that got her into this mess! You\\'re trying\\nto crawl round Chamber-pot Tu and be his concubines! You\\ndirty bitches, you! Makes me feel sick to look at you!”\\n\\nShe slammed the bamboo door to. Suddenly she pulled herself\\ntogether and stopped crying as an overpowering feeling of\\nhatred came over her. She hated Chamber-pot Tu and Yao\\nChin-feng; she hated all the girls who were going back to work.\\nThen out of this burning hatred there grew a vague kind of\\npride in her mind: her daughter was not a blackleg!\\n\\nChin Ho-shang and Little San-tse seemed to be infused with\\nsimilar feelings, though they were discussing something else\\nnow. Chin Ho-shang spoke first.\\n\\n“It’s getting late! You know we decided yesterday to all\\ngo down together and give that bastard Chou Chung-wei a\\nshaking-up, well, are you coming?”\\n\\n“Yes, ‘course I am! If that bloody ‘Red-tipped Match’ is going\\nto shut down the factory, we\\'ll go and burn him into a ‘black-\\ntipped match’! We\\'ll smash up his kennel!”\\n\\n“Ah, but he might have bolted by now! Or he might have\\nthe police outside on guard!”\\n\\n“Bah!” Little San-tse roared, pounding the flimsy table with\\nhis fist. “Didn’t we all agree yesterday that if he bolts we\\'ll\\nwait down at his kennel till he comes back?”\\n\\nRealizing what it was all about, his mother suddenly stamped\\nher foot and shouted at the top of her voice. “I\\'m coming along\\ntoo! I’m not going to stay here and see you all run in by the\\npolice one after the other! I’m coming with you!”\\n\\nAs she shouted, she seized hold of her son’s arm and clung\\ndesperately to him, though whether she did it because she\\nwanted to go with him or whether to hold back, she did not\\nreally know. Whatever the reason she clung to him, crying and\\nshouting. Chin Ho-shang did not know quite what to do, while\\nLittle San-tse, his face flushed, stamped his feet and shouted\\nat her:\\n\\n“Don’t be a fool, Mum! We don’t want old women like you\\nin on this sort of thing! It’s no picnic we\\'re going on!”\\n\\nWith a great effort he shook off his mother and ran out taking\\nChin Ho-shang with him.\\n\\n*\\n\\nThe sun was high in the sky by the time Chin Ho-shang,\\nLittle San-tse and fifty or sixty other workers from the match\\nfactory arrived at the street where their employer Chou Chung-\\nwei lived. His house lay back from the street at the end of a\\nnarrow lane, the entrance of which was guarded by a police-\\nman, who would only admit eight delegates out of the sixty of\\nthem, so that the rest had to wait outside in the street, where\\nthey squatted on the pavement and used the corners of their\\n\\njackets to wipe their perspiring foreheads and fan themselves\\nwith.\\n\\nLittle San-tse was one of the eight delegates. They found\\nthe front door of the house shut tight, and though they bawled\\nat the top of their voices for a considerable time, the house might\\nhave been empty for all the answer they got. Little San-tse lost\\nhis temper and began pounding loudly on the door with his fist\\nand raving at the top of his voice, “You won\\'t get rid of us\\nby hiding in there! If you don’t show yourself, we\\'ll bloody well\\nset light to your house and see if that doesn’t fetch you out!”\\n\\n“We\\'re setting fire to it now!” the other seven delegates\\nshouted in chorus. “We’re going to burn you out!” One of\\nthem was actually taking a box of matches out of his pocket,\\nwhen a sudden roar of laughter came from the balcony above\\ntheir heads. They recognized the laugh and quickly looked up\\nto see Chou Chung-wei himself standing up there, barefoot and\\nwearing a silk jacket, smiling down at them. The delegates\\nresponded to this provocation by dancing with rage and cursing\\nand shouting at him, but Chou Chung-wei just smiled. Sud-\\ndenly, he shook his head, stood on tiptoe, and leant his short,\\nfat body over the balustrade.\\n\\n“So you’re going to set fire to the place, are you?” he shouted.\\n“You’re welcome! My belongings are covered by a _ thirty-\\nthousand-dollar fire policy, and I’d be extremely grateful to you\\nfor helping me to the money! The house doesn’t belong to me\\nso set fire to it by all means! There’s just one thing though—\\nmy wife’s ill in bed and you\\'ll have to take her out on a stretcher\\nbefore you start!”\\n\\nAt this he went off into another fit of laughter and laughed\\nuntil he was quite red in the face. The delegates did not know\\nwhat to do with him, so they just kept hurling abuse at him.\\nHe took it broad-mindedly—the harder they swore, the louder\\nhe laughed. Suddenly he stopped laughing and addressed them\\nin a serious voice:\\n\\n“Now listen to me, dear friends! I’ve got a brilliant idea!—\\nGo and burn down the factory as well! It’s insured for eighty\\nthousand dollars and the policy expires in a couple of weeks!\\nSo you\\'d better hurry up if you’re going to burn it down! The\\ninsurance company’s owned by a foreigner, and we\\'d all like\\n\\nto make a packet at the foreigners’ expense! If only you\\'ll help\\nme get my hands on a nice little windfall like that, I shall never\\nknow how to thank you! Tell you what: Ill stand you all\\na slap-up feed at the Good Luck Restaurant! That’s a promise!”\\n\\nThe delegates were ready to burst with rage. They had\\ncursed themselves hoarse, but still they had made not the\\nslightest impression on the imperturbable Chou Chung-wei. In\\nany case, there were only eight of them and even if they did\\nfind some way of dealing with him, there was not much they\\ncould do on their own, so after a brief consultation they retired\\nto see the others about it.\\n\\nChou Chung-wei remained on the balcony to see the delegates\\noff. When they had disappeared round the corner, he stepped\\nback into the room, still shaking with laughter. Chou Chung-\\nwei’s “residence” was the usual type of thing: three storeys of\\nthree rooms each. Since his match factory had folded up, he\\nhad vacated one wing in case he had to sub-let part of the house,\\nand dismissed one cook and two maids. An atmosphere of\\ngloom had descended on the house, the more so now that his wife\\nwas in the third stage of consumption, so that she was com-\\npletely bed-ridden; yet Chou Chung-wei could still often wear a\\nsmile. He had started out in life without a penny to his name\\nand had made his way as a compradore. He had never been\\nreally well off, though he had been able to keep up appearances.\\nHe had a genius for “getting rich quick”—and for losing his\\nmoney even faster. And however bad his luck, he could always\\nraise a smile.\\n\\nHaving repulsed the eight delegates, he now hurried back\\ndownstairs to the side-room where he had been playing with\\nhis “models.” Two tables had been placed end to end, and on\\nthem was set out a complete set of toys representing a birthday\\nparty. The fortieth anniversary of his coming into the world\\nwas due in August next year, and he was already rehearsing\\nin miniature the magnificent birthday party in the old-fashioned\\nstyle that he had promised himself. He had started his rehearsal\\nearly in the morning, and was just beginning to enjoy himself\\nwhen the eight delegates had arrived and made such an infernal\\ndin outside that he had had to dash up to the balcony and keep\\nthem amused. Now he had come back to his “little display.” It\\n\\nsuddenly struck him that his wife’s death might occur before\\nhis own great event, so he cancelled the birthday party and\\nbegan rearranging his toys to represent an old-fashioned funeral\\nservice. He set up a three-inch-high funeral curtain and laid\\nwhite satin covers over the miniature ebony chairs, arranging\\nevery detail with greater care and enthusiasm than he would\\never have expended on his match factory.\\n\\nHe had just arranged a pair of lanterns the size of oranges,\\nand was about to set up the eastern and western archways for\\nfuneral procession, when two visitors burst into the room and\\nhe had to abandon his great project.\\n\\nThe two intruders were Chu Yin-chiu and Chen Chun-yi.\\nWhen they caught sight of the paraphernalia on the two tables,\\nthey both burst out laughing. Chou Chung-wei himself rubbed\\nhis hands with glee and joined in their laughter. Chu Yin-chiu\\nclapped him on the shoulder and said: “Chung-wei, I take my\\nhat off to you: you’ve got the patience of a saint! And all the\\ntime your employees are asking for you outside—blocking the\\nentrance to the lane and quarrelling with the policeman!”\\n\\n“Eh? Are you serious? I haven’t heard a sound myself!\\nWell, you\\'ll have to excuse me, then. I’d better go and see\\nwhat it’s all about!”\\n\\nHe put on a look of great surprise as he said this, and let\\nthe smile fade from his lips. He began buttoning up his jacket,\\nas if preparing to go out, but Chen Chun-yi grasped him by the\\narm and held him back.\\n\\n“You mustn’t go out there! Let them shout as much as they\\nlike. Remember, Chung-wei: ‘Discretion is the better part of\\nvalour!’ It wouldn’t be wise for you to show yourself just\\nnow!”\\n\\n“Chun-yi’s right,” said Chu Yin-chiu. “Only two days ago\\nWu Sun-fu nearly had his car smashed with him inside it! The\\nway the workers are getting out of hand just lately is simply\\npreposterous!—Though you know, Chung-wei, I never expected\\nto see you losing money in the match business and being driven\\nto closing down your factory! You ought to be much better\\noff than we are, when you think that matches are indispensable\\nin every home—as indispensable as food and fuel. Even the\\ntramps in the street, who can go for hours without food, still\\n\\nhave to pick up dog-ends for a smoke. And they can’t smoke\\nthem without matches! So even the tramps are bringing you\\ntrade!”\\n\\nHe picked up one of the miniature lanterns and toyed with\\n{t, an amused smile on his lips.\\n\\nChou Chung-wei did not reply, but suddenly roared with\\nlaughter and skipped into the back room like a toad lolloping\\nalong. He rummaged among a pile of old letters on a desk and\\npresently came back with a duplicated circular clutched be-\\ntween his pudgy fingers. He handed it to his two visitors.\\n\\n“If you two gentlemen will cast your eye over this, you\\'ll\\nsee just how prosperous the match business is!”\\n\\nIt was a circular from the All-China Association of Match\\nManufacturers to all its members. Attached to it was a copy\\nof a petition sent to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry by\\nthe Kwangtung branch of the association. The circular itself\\nread as follows:\\n\\nDear Member— We have received a letter from our\\nKwangtung branch informing us that, according to reports\\nappearing in newspapers in Kwangtung Province and Hong-\\nkong, the Swedish China Match Company, an enterprise\\nconducted by Swedish merchants in this country, has made\\nthe government a loan in return for a monopoly of the match\\nbusiness in China for a number of years.\\n\\nGreatly alarmed by these reports, our Kwangtung branch\\nhas asked us to make investigations and give them a reply\\nwhich will dispel the uncertainty which surrounds the whole\\naffair. They enclosed with their letter a copy of the peti-\\ntion they are sending to the Ministry of Commerce and\\nIndustry.\\n\\nWe are also in receipt of a letter to the same effect from\\nour Northeastern Provinces branch, who heard the news\\nfrom certain Japanese match manufacturers in China, who\\nin turn heard it from their Consul-General in Shanghai.\\nAgain, the Northeastern Provinces branch asks us to make\\ninquiries and confirm or deny the rumour of a Swedish\\nmonopoly.\\n\\nIn view of the currency of these reports, we should like\\nto point out that we began to investigate the matter as far\\n\\nback as June, and that repeated inquiries show that the\\nproposed loan from the Swedish company has not yet ma-\\nterialized; nevertheless, realizing that, in default of a clear\\ndeclaration by the government, the fact that the rumour is\\nstill gaining ground must necessarily cause our members\\nconsiderable anxiety, we ourselves have addressed an inquiry\\nto the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, requesting that\\nthey give us a definite reply. As soon as the reply is re-\\nceived, we shall transmit it to you without delay.\\n\\nWe enclose for your information a copy of the petition\\nsent by the Kwangtung branch to the Ministry of Commerce\\nand Industry and a copy of our own petition to the ministry.\\n\\nStanding on tiptoe behind Chu Yin-chiu’s seat, Chou Chung-\\nwei read the letter aloud from beginning to end. After pausing\\na moment for breath, he went on to read at the top of his voice\\npart of the petition from the Kwangtung branch:\\n\\n... As the civil war drags on from year to year, it brings\\nslump and depression in its train and has reduced trade and\\nindustry to their lowest ebb. In order to offset its financial\\ndeficits, the government has repeatedly raised the import\\nduty on the raw materials used by the match industry, in-\\ncreased taxation and issued government bonds, with the\\nresult that business and industry have been saddled with a\\ncrippling burden which has depressed them beyond recovery.\\n\\nThe Swedish Match Trust is taking advantage of this\\nsituation to squeeze out Chinese match manufacturers by\\nflooding the Chinese market with their own products, which\\nenjoy a light import duty, and undercutting Chinese manu-\\nfacturers, who are burdened with heavy production-costs.\\nThe result is that our own products are piling up in moun-\\ntains, and that we are having to sell them at a loss in order\\nto keep the industry alive.\\n\\nIt is impossible for Chinese manufacturers, with their\\nlimited capital, to compete with the Swedish Match Trust,\\nwhose immense capital and great influence have enabled it\\nto extend its ruthless dominion to every corner of the globe:\\nas a result, over fifty per cent of Chinese match factories\\nhave been forced to close down one after the other.\\nShaking his head, Chou Chung-wei suddenly burst out laugh-\\ning again:\\n\\n“Well, there you are, gentlemen! You can see for yourselves\\nwhat a good business my trade is!—It must be, otherwise the\\nSwedish Match Trust wouldn’t be so keen to get their hands\\non it!”\\n\\nChen Chun-yi and Chu Yin-chiu looked at one another and\\nfrowned. To them, Chou Chung-wei’s laughter sounded like\\nthe laughter of despair, but so far as Chou Chung-wei himself\\nwas concerned, it was the real thing. He could always raise\\na boisterous laugh: otherwise, how could he be as fat as he was?\\n\\nJust then, Chou Chung-wei’s rickshaw boy dashed in in a state\\nof great agitation to report that the workers had chosen ten\\ndelegates, who were now trying to get into the lane. With a\\ntug at Chen Chun-yi’s sleeve, Chu Yin-chiu rose to go, but\\nChou Chung-wei barred the way and would not let him pass.\\n\\n“Don’t go yet!?? he urged. “I’ve got something important I\\nwant to discuss with you! Surely you\\'re not afraid of these ten\\ndelegates?”\\n\\n“No, no, it isn’t that, Chung-wei! Since you\\'ll have to have\\nit out with them, there’s no point in our staying—we\\'ll only be\\nin the way! If you’ve got something important to discuss, we\\ncan leave it until this afternoon. All right?”\\n\\n“Afraid not! Look here, old man, I’m very sorry, but since\\nyou’re here, I’m going to ask you to stay a little longer so that\\nyou two can be my bodyguards in this emergency! Don’t worry:\\nmy employees are very civilized people, and I treat them in a\\ncivilized manner! If they should happen to upset you, I\\'d offer\\nyou my apologies!”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei\\'s face was quite flushed now, and as he\\nspoke he bowed to his visitors with clasped hands. Then he\\nspread out his arms to keep them in their seats and prevent\\nthem from leaving. The two visitors were mystified by his\\nantics and wondered what the “Red-tipped Match” was up to\\nnow, but they could not help Jaughing.\\n\\nBut the laughter died on their lips as there suddenly came a\\nthunderous pounding on the front door, and they began to look\\nuncomfortable rather than amused. The angry shouts of the\\ndelegates could be heard with painful clarity: “Chou, you old\\n\\nswine! Come out, you old thief!” The two visitors were be-\\nginning to feel embarrassed and their faces crimsoned to the\\ntips of their ears, but Chou Chung-wei himself was still grin-\\nning. He patted himself on the chest and looked straight at his\\ntwo friends.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t I tell you they were civilized people?” he said. “As\\ncivilized as they make ’em! Still, it’?ll take more than rude\\nnames to spoil my appetite! Y’know, Chun-yi, back in the old\\ncompradore days, our foreign boss often got out of bed on the\\nwrong side and raved and swore at us, and it was a lot worse\\nthan this, I can tell you! In this case, the workers are Chinese,\\nand we are also Chinese, so that by cursing us they’re as good\\nas cursing themselves!”\\n\\n“I can’t help admiring your great self-control, Chung-wei!”\\nteased Chen Chun-yi, straight-faced. “I bet you wouldn’t turn\\na hair even if they slapped you in the face, would you?”\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu frowned at this, but Chou Chung-wei at once\\nshook his head and said in a serious voice:\\n\\n“Of course not! I remember the boss of a certain foreign\\nfirm—he might have been an American or he might have been\\na German, I don’t remember which; anyway, he was a foreigner.\\nHe said to me one day: ‘You Chinese are wonderful. When\\nsomebody knocks you over on to the ground, you just lie there\\nand say you’re more comfortable than when you were standing.\\nWhen you can no jJonger walk on your legs, you just roll along\\non the ground!’ Don’t you agree, Chun-yi? There was a man\\nwho understood the Chinese temperament! Yes, we Chinese\\ncertainly know how to enjoy ourselves come what may!”\\n\\nBy now the uproar outside was more furious than ever. Sud-\\ndenly two heads appeared outside the barred window over-\\nlooking the lane and peeped into the room. Chu Yin-chiu was\\nthe first to see them, and he could not suppress a start. The\\nheads sank out of sight again, and immediately the sound of\\nshouting and cursing rose in a crescendo, so that the three men\\ninside could no longer hear their own conversation. Chu Yin-\\nchiu sighed and turned to Chou Chung-wei.\\n\\n“You can’t afford to ignore them, Chung-wei! You\\'d best ring\\nup the police station and ask them to send some men round to\\ndrive them away!”\\n\\n“Yes, Chung-wei, I think you ought to do that. Your wife\\'s\\nseriously ill and it’s not right that she should be disturbed like\\nthis!”\\n\\n“Oh, that doesn\\'t matter! She’s stone deaf. Now don’t take\\nme seriously, but her life insurance policy expires on the day\\nafter tomorrow, so if anything does happen to her today, it\\nwould be a case of pennies from heaven for a very deserving\\ncase! Ha! Ha!—Though they’ve been shouting so long now that\\nthey’ve shouted themselves hoarse. I feel really sorry for them\\nand I think I ought to send them home now. It’d be a help if\\nyou two gentlemen could give me a little moral support while\\nJ speak to them. I’m sure you don’t mind helping me out once\\nin a while for old times’ sake!”\\n\\n“Tell us first what you’re up to, Chung-wei,” said Chen Chun-\\nyi nervously, getting to his feet. “you’re running a great risk\\nif you’re thinking of pulling their legs!”\\n\\nSeeing him get up, Chu Yin-chiu followed suit. The shouting\\noutside suddenly began to die down.\\n\\n“I can assure you that not a hair of your heads will be touched!\\nI just ask you to do one thing: whatever I say to them, you\\nvouch for my sincerity, and I\\'ll be extremely grateful.”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei accompanied his cryptic request with a roar\\nof laughter, then went and opened the front door and shouted\\nat the delegates:\\n\\n“Now shut up, all of you! Don’t you know the old proverb?\\n‘Save your breath to cool your porridge!’ And I’m seeing to it\\nthat you all get your porridge, too!”\\n\\nThe crowd outside had by now increased by one more—an\\narmed policeman trying to restore order. When they saw Chou\\nChung-wei coming out, the ten delegates immediately swarmed\\nup and surrounded him, everyone shouting at once. Although\\nChou Chung-wei was an old stager who had been through the\\nmill, he now felt suddenly nervous. The blood had rushed to\\nhis cheeks and his forehead was bathed in sweat. He could not\\nthink how to begin. He thought of escape, but that was now\\nimpossible.\\n\\n“Now stop your noise!” bawled the policeman, forcing his way\\nthrough the ring of delegates. “Wait and hear what Mr. Chou’s\\n\\ngot to say before you start opening your mouths! Where’s your\\nmanners?”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei raised his hand to wipe his perspiring fore-\\nhead, then swallowed and shouted at the top of his voice:\\n\\n“Now listen to me! You’re Chinese, and I’m Chinese—Chinese\\nshould help Chinese! Now what is it you want? You want me\\nto open up the factory again, don\\'t you? Well and good! If the\\nfactory remains closed any longer, you\\'ll starve to death—and\\nso shall I! So you see, I’d have opened the factory again even if\\nyou hadn’t come here and kicked up a row! Though you ought\\nto thank your lucky stars that I’ve just had two Gods of Wealth\\ncome to see me—look, there they are in my room! They’ve\\npromised me a loan, so tomorrow we all go back to work again!”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei broke into an exultant laugh, but by now\\nhe was out of breath and so excited that his laughter quickly\\npetered out and left him standing there open-mouthed and pant-\\ning for breath, his eyes wide and staring. Some of the delegates\\nbegan to look threateningly at him again—though they made no\\nsound—while others ran through the front door to see if there\\nreally were any Gods of Wealth there. Chou Chung-wei quickly\\nran in after them, and shouted into the side-room in spite of\\nhis panting:\\n\\n“Mr. Chen the banker and Mr. Chu the director! Would you\\nbe so good as to step this way and meet my employees’ repre-\\nsentatives?”\\n\\nChu Yin-chiu did his best to keep a straight face as he walked\\nslowly into the drawing-room, and stood looking out at the dele-\\ngates, a frown on his face. Behind him came Chen Chun-yi,\\nthough he was still smiling.\\n\\nThe delegates suddenly fell silent, then began to look inquir-\\ningly at one another as if unable to decide whether or not these\\ntwo “Gods of Wealth” were the genuine article.\\n\\n“There you are, then!” bawled the policeman. “Mr. Chou’s\\npromised to open the factory again, so there’s nothing for you\\nto wait about here for! Now come on, it’s against the regula-\\ntions to kick up a row like this! Any more trouble, and you’l\\ngo straight down to the station!”\\n\\nHe began to move them on, but Chou Chung-wei stopped him\\nand addressed the delegates again, this time smiling and shaking\\nhis clasped hands respectfully up and down.\\n\\n“I should like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart!\\nIf you hadn\\'t made such a noise just now, my two friends, the\\nbanker and the director here, wouldn’t have lent me the money!\\nAll’s well that ends well, and tomorrow we\\'ll be back at work.\\nAnd when I say a thing I mean it!”\\n\\n“And don\\'t think you can run away, either!” shouted Little\\nSan-tse as he moved off behind the other delegates, then spat\\nin the direction of the front door.\\n\\nAs the three proprietors came back into the room, they all\\nburst out laughing at once. Chou Chung-wei began walking up\\nand down, his fleshy head wagging with elation, as if he had\\nactually obtained a loan. He had always kept at the back of\\nhis mind two ways of getting financial assistance, and in his\\npresent mood of elation they suddenly came back to him and he\\nbegan toying with them in a make-believe sort of way: he\\nglanced at Chu Yin-chiu and thought to himself: “Let’s pretend\\nhe’s the head of that Japanese!” The idea so amused him that\\nhe could not help laughing again. He was still laughing when\\nChen Chun-yi suddenly said in a solemn voice:\\n\\n“Chung-wei, you really must think of a way out. You got rid\\nof them today by pulling their legs, but you’re going to find your-\\nself in a bit of a mess when they come back tomorrow and start\\nkicking up a row again!”\\n\\n“Chun-yi’s right,” put in Chu Yin-chiu. “When they come\\nback tomorrow, you\\'ll find they won’t be so civilized as they\\nwere just now. You\\'ll have to forestall them!”\\n\\nHe frowned, and Chou Chung-wei thought how much more he\\nresembled the head of the Japanese firm when he frowned. The\\nthought made him smile as he replied:\\n\\n“A way out? Ah, but I’ve got one! And you are the people\\nwho can help me out!”\\n\\nThe two visitors were taken aback for a moment, especially\\nas Chou Chung-wei did not look as if he was joking. Putting\\non his gravest expression, he went on:\\n\\n‘Tye got it all worked out. I’m fed up with my business and\\nwhoever wants what\\'s left of my factory can have it. It’s a pity\\n\\nthe Swedish Match Trust isn’t going to run factories in this\\ncountry, otherwise I might co-operate with them. Now a short\\nwhile ago I told you I’d got something important that I wanted\\nto consult you about: well, here it is. So far as I can see, there\\nare two ways open to me: either I go to see the head of a Jap-\\nanese firm I know quite well and who’s willing to help me out,\\nor else I approach the Yi Chung Trust Company. Being a\\nChinese, I naturally prefer to give one of my own kind the first\\nchance. Besides, Wang Ho-fu, Sun Chi-jen and Wu Sun-fu are\\nold friends of mine and it’s only natural that I should approach\\nsomeone I know very well first. Well, that’s the way I look\\nat it, though of course, I don’t know what their reaction would\\nbe. Now the thing is, both of you have very close dealings\\nwith the Yi Chung Company, so I was hoping you’d be able\\nto tell me whether they’d help me out or not.”\\n\\n“I see... you’re thinking of trying that way, eh?” said Chen\\nChun-yi hesitantly, with a glance at Chu Yin-chiu. “Are you\\nthinking of leasing your factory or selling out? They don’t\\nmake loans on pledges, you know!”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei’s reference to the Yi Chung Trust Company\\nhad touched one of Chu Yin-chiu’s tender spots, and, being sus-\\npicious by nature, he assumed that Chou Chung-wei was pur-\\nposely taunting him. He frowned and sighed, but said nothing.\\n\\n“Doesn’t matter which! Either way will do!” replied Chou\\nChung-wei quickly. “In any case, we’re all friends, so we can\\neasily come to an agreement on that!”\\n\\nOne would have assumed from his eagerness that Chen Chun-\\nyi was a representative from the Yi Chung Company and that\\ntheir informal exchanges were serious negotiations for a con-\\ntract! Chen Chun-yi smiled. Although he felt that Chou\\nChung-wei was being rather too precipitate, he fully sympathized\\nwith him, and his voice was earnest as he went on:\\n\\n“As you probably know, Chung-wei, Wu Sun-fu is the real\\npower behind the Yi Chung Trust Company. He’s very sharp,\\nis Sun-fu, and fastidious, too! Offer him something, and he’ll\\npick holes in it; but let him once take a fancy to your factory,\\nand it’s a different story altogether: he’ll badger you and harry\\nyou until you’re in an impossible position, and you’ll end up by\\n\\ngoing and begging him to take it! Our friend Yin-chiu here,\\nfor instance, had suffered at his hands in exactly that way—”\\n\\n“Your best bet’s your Japanese friend!” interrupted Chu Yin-\\nchiu, and heaved a sigh of resentment. “You might as well try\\nto take a piece of meat out of a tiger’s mouth as have dealings\\nwith Wu Sun-ful”\\n\\nSo it was good-bye to Chou Chung-wei’s castles in the air.\\nHis face was flushed and his eyes were wide and staring. As\\na matter of fact, he had already made overtures to his Japanese\\nfriend, but the latter’s terms had been so harsh that he had been\\ndriven to consider trying the Yi Chung Trust Company. Now\\nthat he had heard what his two friends had to say about Wu\\nSun-fu, he was beginning to feel desperate. For the first time\\nin his life, he could not even raise a laugh! Nevertheless, he\\nhad not yet entirely given up hope, for he did not mind being\\nbadly treated, so long as the ill-treatment was accompanied\\nby a cash profit, however small. He wiped his hand across his\\nperspiring forehead, then, a lugubrious expression on his face,\\nhe asked in an agitated voice:\\n\\n“Now tell me, Chun-yi, how does one go about leasing out a\\nfactory? I suppose both of you leased yours?”\\n\\n“Yes, both of us. Yin-chiu’s turned over his factory to Wu\\nSun-fu, lock, stock and barrel. He doesn’t have anything to\\ndo with it now, except to collect the rent for it—five hundred\\ntaels of silver a month. As for me, I’m in charge of my fac-\\ntory the same as before, with the empty title of general man-\\nager, and they pay me a monthly salary. People outside think\\nI\\'m still the proprietor, but as a matter of fact I can’t do a\\nthing without asking Wang Ho-fu first—still, I can’t grumble:\\nWang Ho-fu’s a decent chap and we get on well enough to-\\ngether! Instead of me collecting rent for the factory buildings\\nand machinery, we have a special arrangement whereby I get\\none per cent of the price of every piece of goods produced as\\ncompensation for the depreciation of the buildings and machinery.\\nWell, that’s the way they work. You see how sharp they are!”\\n\\n“Well, I’m perfectly agreeable to an arrangement such as\\nyours! Perfectly agreeable!” exclaimed Chou Chung-wei, leap-\\ning to his feet. His hopes had revived and he could smile once\\n\\nagain. But Chu Yin-chiu threw cold water on his rising spirits\\nwhen he said gloomily:\\n\\n“Tm afraid you’re going to change your tune when you hear\\nwhat sort of a monthly salary Chun-yi gets! Two hundred and\\nfifty dollars! A mere two hundred and fifty dollars for managing\\na silk goods factory employing over three hundred workers! Wu\\nSun-fu has the cheek to offer it, and Chun-yi has the goodness\\nto take it. I wouldn’t!”\\n\\n“I’ve got no choice in the matter! It’s better than closing\\ndown the factory and letting the machinery go rusty! My\\nmachinery is good, and I couldn’t bear to see it go rusty. That’s\\nwhere the shoe pinches: they’ve got the better of me whatever\\nI do! Still, so long as I can still have the run of my factory\\nand keep an eye on things, I don’t mind so much. Don’t you\\nagree, Chung-wei?”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei nodded but did not speak. An unusually\\ngrim expression clouded his plump face: he was thinking hard.\\nHe was rather taken by the idea of leasing out his factory under\\nthe same arrangement as Chen Chun-yi. It appealed to him\\nmainly because by staying on as manager he would still be the\\nproprietor so far as people outside were concerned. For Chou\\nChung-wei, this was not merely a matter of vanity, but also\\nsomething which meant a lot to him financially: for years now\\nhe struggled to keep up appearances, and this he had managed\\nto do almost entirely on the strength of his impressive but\\nworthless title of “proprietor of a match factory.” If ever he\\nshould lose this title, he would be unmasked and hard put to\\nit to deal with the swarm of creditors who would descend\\nupon him. And that would be an end to his easy laughter.\\n\\nSo Chou Chung-wei decided to try his luck with Wu Sun-fu.\\nHis ambition now was to become “Chen Chun-yi the Second.”\\n\\nHe suddenly sprang to his feet, clapped his hands together,\\nand turned to Chen Chun-yi:\\n\\n“You\\'re perfectly right when you say that one shouldn’t let\\none’s machinery lie idle and go rusty! And as you saw, that\\npetition from the Kwangtung branch association stated quite\\nclearly that over fifty per cent of the Chinese match factories\\nhave closed down! Being a Chinese, I’m under an obligation\\nto protect Chinese factories! My Japanese friend has offered\\n\\nme a high price for my factory, and although he’s a Japanese,\\nChina and Japan have always been friendly neighbours and\\nhave the same linguistic and racial origins, so it’s not the same\\nthing as selling out to a complete foreigner like a Swedish match\\nking; nevertheless, for all that, I won’t let him have it! I\\'d\\nmuch rather let the Yi Chung Company have the benefit of my\\nfactory. It’s up to us Chinese to help one another! That’s that,\\nthen! I’m off to see Wu Sun-fu about it this very minute!”\\n\\n“you\\'re wasting your time, Chung-wei!” said Chu Yin-chiu\\ngloomily, dousing Chou Chung-wei’s hopes once more. \"“T don’t\\nneed a crystal ball to tell you that you won\\'t cut any ice with\\nWu Sun-fu, and that you\\'ll come away with a flea in your ear!”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei sprang up in alarm, his face flushed. Chen\\nChun-yi quickly intervened:\\n\\n“There’s no harm in trying, Chung-wei. Not so long ago the\\nYi Chung Company bought out eight factories all at once, so\\nit would seem that your proposition is in their line of business.\\nThough I shouldn’t advise you to see Wu Sun-fu, you’d much\\nbetter approach Wang Ho-fu. He’s easier to deal with, and any-\\nway, he’s the company’s general manager.”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei looked slightly relieved and nodded his head.\\nHe was so eager to become “Chen Chun-yi the Second” that\\neverything Chen Chun-yi said was music in his ears. It gave\\nhim the creeps to listen to that bird of ill omen, the pessimistic\\nChu Yin-chiu. He cast a sidelong glance at Chu Yin-chiu, and\\nhad to laugh despite himself. He was thinking: “The more I\\nlook at you, the more you look like that Japanese fellow! A\\nbad lot, that Jap!”\\n\\n*\\n\\nAt one o’clock that afternuon, Chou Chung-wei was sitting in\\nthe manager\\'s office of the Yi Chung Trust Company, talking\\nwith Wang Ho-fu and cherishing great hopes. At a desk under\\nthe window sat a young typist tapping steadily away at a Chinese\\ntypewriter. Wang Ho-fu sat there with a worried expression on\\nhis face, listening absently to what Chou Chung-wei was saying\\nand glancing every now and then at the typist, as if he was not\\nsatisfied with his speed. Suddenly, the muffled jangle of a tele-\\nphone came from the private office next door, and a clerk came\\ninto the room and drew Wang Ho-fu’s attention to it:\\n\\n“Phone for you, sir.”\\n\\n“Exeuse me, Mr. Chou. I won’t be a moment.”\\n\\nSo saying, Wang Ho-fu hurried off, despite the fact that Chou\\nChung-wei was just coming to the crucial point, and the door of\\nthe private office slammed shut behind him.\\n\\nChou Chung-wei drew a deep breath, mopped his perspiring\\nbrow, and gulped down a mouthful of tea. The room seemed like\\nan oven to him. His corpulent frame was bathed in sweat and\\nhe was finding it difficult to breathe. The breeze from the elec-\\ntric fan seemed hot and stifling and only served to add to his\\ndiscomfort. He stood up and walked up and down for a mo-\\nment, then stopped behind the typist and glanced casually at\\nwhat he was typing. He was half-way through a notice, and\\nChou Chung-wei would have given it no more than a passing\\nglance if one particular sentence had not leapt up at him and\\nheld his attention. As he stared at it, his hopes gradually began\\nto ebb away until they had almost vanished. This is what had\\ncaught his eye: “In order to cut down production, the eight\\nfactories will operate on half time for the time being.”\\n\\nWhen Chou Chung-wei sat down again, he was _ perspiring\\nmore profusely than ever, yet the icy fingers of despair were\\nclosing round his ever-cheerful heart and sapping his vitality.\\nHe sat there mechanically wiping his forehead with his hand\\nand staring anxiously at the door of the private office, wishing\\nthat Wang Ho-fu would hurry up and come out again.\\n\\nFive minutes passed, then ten, but still there was no sign\\nof Wang Ho-fu. Although Chou Chung-wei was normally quite\\npatient, he was beginning to feel he had been left to cool his\\nheels too long. Meanwhile, the typist had finished what he was\\ndoing, stretched, and was now leaning out of the window and\\nwatching the fashionably-dressed girls and round-bellied busi-\\nnessmen in the street below.\\n\\nUnable to wait any longer—especially in this stifling heat—\\nChou Chung-wei decided to go and fetch Wang Ho-fu back, but\\nhe was in such a flurry that he went the wrong way—over to\\nthe door leading to the corridur. He did not realize his mistake\\nuntil he had his hand on the door. He laughed at his mistake;\\nthe door at once swung open as if he had laughed it open, and\\na gust of perfume struck him. He found himself face to face\\n\\nwith a man and a woman, both acquaintances of his, who stood\\nthere smiling at him. The woman was Hsu Man-li and the\\nman was Colonel Lei, and they were arm in arm,\\n\\n“Well! If it isn’t Colonel Lei!” Chou Chung-wei exclaimed,\\nbeaming at him. “How long have you been back? This is a\\npleasant surprise!”\\n\\nHis low spirits had suddenly vanished. Before the colonel\\ncould reply, he turned quickly to Hsu Man-li and greeted her\\nas warmly. His numbed mind had revived again—he had a\\nbrain-wave. Here under his very nose was the opportunity he\\nhad been looking for. From Hsu Man-li his thoughts had flashed\\nto Chao Po-tao, from Chao Po-tao to the news of Chao Po-tao’s\\nlatest success in stock-jobbing, and then, what was most im-\\nportant, from Chao Po-tao’s success to the widely-circulated\\nrumour that Chao Po-tao was organizing some kind of trust to\\nbuy up factories! His smouldering hopes had burst into flame\\nonce more, and he began reproaching himself for being so stupid\\nas not to have thought of the idea before, for Chao Po-tao was\\na real “God of Wealth” if anyone was!\\n\\nWang Ho-fu now emerged from his private office, and after\\nthe usual exchange of courtesies he drew Colonel Lei to one side\\nand they had a whispered conversation together. His mind now\\nbuzzing with ideas, Chou Chung-wei seized on this opportunity\\nto ingratiate himself with Hsu Man-li and soon the room was\\nringing with his boisterous laughter. Hsu Man-li pursed her\\nlips in a smile and cooed:\\n\\n“It\\'s very nice of you, Mr. Chou, to play the host and entertain\\nme like this! No wonder they call you the ‘Red-tipped Match’!”\\n\\nAt this he laughed louder than ever. Suddenly, he stopped\\nand the smile vanished from his face.\\n\\n“Miss Hsu,” he said in a serious voice. “I wonder if you’d\\ndo me a little favour? It’s nothing much, but you\\'re the only\\nperson who can help me!”\\n\\n“Er—what is it, then?”\\n\\n“It’s—it’s just a trifle, really. You see, as a result of the war,\\nmy factory’s been running into difficulties—”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, I know! Everyone who owns a factory feels the\\npinch in wartime. But you have nothing to worry about, Mr.\\n\\nChou! you’re the famous ‘Red-tipped Match’ and you strike up\\nfriendships wherever you go!”\\n\\n“Ah, but this is an unusually black year for me. Very unusual.\\nAll the ready money which should be in circulation is locked\\nup in stocks and bonds, and if you ask anybody for a loan of\\na few thousand dollars, he just shakes his head. Fact is, I’m\\nin a bit of a jam at the moment. I don’t need much—matter of\\nfifty thousand dollars; though even twenty or thirty thousand\\nwould probably tide me over. I’m sure you\\'ll help me out, Miss\\nHsu?”\\n\\n“What! Me help you? You\\'re pulling my leg!”\\n\\n“Not at all! I’m quite serious about it! I know Chao Po-tao\\ngives loans right and left, but I haven’t lived up to my name\\n‘Red-tipped Match’ by striking up acquaintance with that God\\nof Wealth. I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this stroke\\nof good luck, running into you like this today, Miss Hsu—I must\\nhave had very virtuous ancestors! What I want you to do is\\nto be so good as to put a word in for me. One word from you\\nwould be better than an imperial edict; one nod from Chao Po-\\ntao and I\\'m saved!”\\n\\nBefore Chou Chung-wei had finished what he was saying, Hsu\\nMan-li’s pretty face suddenly clouded over. She shot him one\\nindignant glance as much as to say, “Stop trying to take the rise\\nout of me!” then turned her head away and shook her shoulders\\npeevishly. Realizing that something had gone wrong, Chou\\nChung-wei suddenly felt at a loss. He licked his lips and dared\\nnot say anything more, After a while, Hsu Man-li looked round\\nagain and said with a wry smile:\\n\\n“Ym having nothing more to do with Chao Po-tao, the scoun-\\ndrel! If you want an introduction to him, you\\'ll have to get\\nsomebody else to do it for you!”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei’s heart sank completely at this. One more\\nray of hope had been quenched. His mind was numb. Hsu\\nMan-li now rose lightly to her feet with a sway of her hips and\\nthrew Chou Chung-wei a glance which held a hint of mockery.\\nHe sprang up in great agitation to make a final appeal, but Hsu\\nMan-li had already turned and glided away. Wang Ho-fu now\\ncame across and patted Chou Chung-wei on the shoulder.\\n\\n‘we didn’t finish our conversation just now, Chung-wei, but\\nI think I know well enough what it was you came about. When\\nwe first set up this company—you remember how we first\\ndiscussed the idea at Old Mr. Wu’s funeral—we originally in-\\ntended to make it the foundation for an industrial bank to finance\\nour colleagues in industry. Unfortunately, conditions have\\nchanged since then, and as a result we’ve been able to manage\\nvery little in the way of industrial loans, and we\\'re unable to\\nmeet all requests we get from our friends. We\\'ve taken over\\neight factories, it\\'s true, but the war has dulled our markets\\nalong the Yangtse, and we’ve run up against keen competition\\nfrom the local Japanese factories, so that we’re now reduced\\nte cutting down production putting the factories on half time.\\nThere’s nothing we’d like better than to help you, but we just\\ncan’t manage it. Sorry to have to disappoint you.”\\n\\n“Yes, Chinese industry’s been going to the dogs for the past\\nsix months!” put in Colonel Lei, who had just walked across\\nto join them. “The flour mills in Tientsin have always done\\na roaring trade and been the pride of the Chinese flour industry;\\nbut look at them now: seven of the eight big mills are closed\\ndown, and the remaining one only works one day in three!”\\n\\nChou Chung-wei was bathed in sweat, and found it hard\\nto speak, even. When he finally managed to get a few words\\nout, it was in a voice which he hardly recognized as his own.\\nAll he could do was to repeat over and over again that his re-\\nquirements were very modest, that his products were selling\\nsteadily, and that his business had not suffered as a result of\\nthe war.\\n\\n“We all run factories, Chung-wei, so we all know what the\\nposition is, and we can well appreciate each other’s difficulties.\\nThe fact of the matter is that in this company we launched out\\non a large scale without the necessary capital behind us. As a\\nresult, we just haven’t got the money to make any more loans.”\\n\\n“Even so, Mr. Wang, surely you can at least take over my\\nfactory on lease, the same as you did with Chen Chun-yi’s\\nfactory?”\\n\\n“If you’d come to us with this proposition a month ago,\\nChung-wei, we could have accommodated you. As it is, I’m\\nafraid you\\'ll have to forgive us.”\\n\\nAs he made this flat refusal, Wang Ho-fu looked into Chou\\nChung-wei’s perspiring face with a grim smile.\\n\\nNow that all his hopes were dashed to the ground, Chou Chung-\\nwei suddenly burst out laughing. He pointed at Colonel Lei with\\none hand and at Wang Ho-fu with the other, and shouted\\nhysterically:\\n\\n“I say! Do you remember? The day of Old Mr. Wu’s funeral!\\nMiss Hsu Man-li was there, too! Remember how she danced\\non the billiard-table? And lost one of her shoes? Ha _ ha!\\nWonderful time we had—seems like a dream now!—But you\\nmustn’t apologize for not being able to help me, Ho-fu-—-we’re old\\nfriends and we don’t have to be so formal about it! But let\\nme tell you something: every Chinese factory will sooner or\\nlater be as dead as a door-nail, unless they get a transfusion of\\nforeign blood! Don’t you agree, Colonel Lei? Just you wait\\nand see! Ha ha! Come on, Miss Hsu, give us another dance!\\nThis table here’s nice and smooth! Let’s enjoy ourselves while\\nwe can!”\\n\\nColonel Lei and Miss Hsu both laughed, but Wang Ho-fu\\nfrowned and his face darkened as he remembered all that had\\nhappened since the day of Old Mr. Wu\\'s funeral: Yes, “dream”\\nwas the right word. They had dreamed of giving industry a\\nnew lease of life, but now—now it looked as if they would soon\\nbe brought back to earth with a jolt!\\n\\n“It’s getting late,’ Hsu Man-li reminded Colonel Lei and\\nWang Ho-fu with a slight frown. “We’ll have to hurry up if\\nwe\\'re going to keep our appointment with Sun-fu at two\\no’clock!”\\n\\nShe gave Chou Chung-wei what could have been a significant\\nglance, but he seemed to be quite unaware that the three of\\nthem had some private business of their own to attend to.\\nNevertheless the words “two o’clock” seemed to have a magical\\neffect on him, for he suddenly leapt to his feet with a “Cheerio!”\\nand raced out. As he went down the stairs he laughed to him-\\nself and before he was out of the building he had made up his\\nmind to go straight round to his Japanese friend and ask him\\nfor “a transfusion of Japanese blood.” Now he was his cheer-\\nful self once again. As he sat in his private rickshaw, he rea-\\nsoned with himself in this fashion: China and Japan are old\\n\\nfriends with common linguistic and racial origins, which means\\nthat a Japanese must be better than a beaky-nosed European.\\nWhen you try to be patriotic and they won\\'t let you, what else\\nis there you can do? In any case, he wouldn’t be the first by\\nany means to throw in his lot with the foreigners!\\n\\nA motorcar roared up behind him and flashed past.\\n\\nHe caught a glimpse of the people in the car—Hsu Man-li\\nand Wang Ho-fu. With Colonel Lei between them. They struck\\nhim as an incongruous trio. “Up to no good, I’! bet,” he\\nthought. This suspicion flashed across his mind, but the next\\ninstant the thought of his coming interview with the Japanese\\nreturned and engaged his full attention. He smiled to himself\\nand nodded as he made up his mind to fall back on the only\\nway left open to him—to make every concession demanded of\\nhim so long as he could keep the title of “proprietor.” Once he\\nlost this title, his creditors would descend on him in a swarm,\\nand he would be worse off than ever.\\n\\nOn the following day the doors of Chou Chung-wei’s match\\nfactory opened again. Overnight he had copied out a new set\\nof regulations which had proved even more exacting than the\\nold ones. Two Japanese who could hardly speak Shanghai dia-\\nlect followed him into the factory, one as a technician and the\\nother as a supervisor.\\n\\nChou Chung-wei was beaming as he bounced to and fro and\\nshowed the two new arrivals over the factory. Finally, he called\\nall his fifty or sixty employees together and made a speech:\\n\\n“I promised you yesterday that I’d open the factory again, and\\nhere we are! You can see I’m a man of my word! Although\\nthe factory’s losing money, I’ve got to carry on. Why? First,\\nbecause if I closed down the factory you\\'d soon starve. But you\\'re\\nChinese, and I’m also Chinese. As a Chinese employer it’s up\\nto me to stand by my Chinese employees! The second reason\\nis that all the time the market’s being flooded with imported\\nmatches, Chinese dollars are being drained out of the country into\\nthe foreigners’ pockets—hundreds of millions a year! Now this\\nis a Chinese factory, and you\\'re Chinese workers making Chinese\\nmatches, so it’s up to you as Chinese workers to help your\\nChinese employer! Production-costs are heavy, which makes\\nChinese goods hard to sell. The best way you can help me is\\n\\nto accept slightly lower wages. Then, once the factory starts\\nmaking money, we all shall be in clover. Now I, as a Chinese\\nemployer, refuse to close down my factory, even though I’m los-\\ning money, because it’s my duty to help my Chinese employees.\\nIn the same way, it’s up to you as Chinese workers to help your\\nChinese employer by working your hardest and keeping down\\ncosts! That’s all. Long live Chinese factories!”\\n\\nIt was as much as the corpulent Chou Chung-wei could do\\nto get this last sentence out, for he was quite out of breath by\\nnow. As he gasped out the final phrase, the word “factories”\\ntrailed away into something like a sob. The veins stood out\\non his round, flushed face despite its plumpness, and beads of\\nsweat rolled down his forehead.\\n\\nThe workers were as silent and expressionless as statues. As\\nhe panted for breath, Chou Chung-wei tried to smile, and dis-\\nmissed his audience with a flap of his hand. Before long, the\\nmachines started rumbling and the matches began to come out\\nin bundles on the conveyor belts, which ran on and on like\\nnever-ending cartridge-belts. As the belts ran on and on, so\\ndid Chou Chung-wei’s thoughts: he was reviewing his life, epi-\\nsode by episode, stage by stage. He had begun as a compradore;\\nlater, he had become a factory-owner—his own master; now\\nhe was a compradore again—though a compradore of a different\\nkind, a mere figure-head! It had indeed been a dream, and now\\nthe wheel had come full circle!\\n\\nHe suddenly laughed. Whatever happened, he could always\\nlaugh.\\nXVII\\n\\nTiERE was no wind. Scattered white clouds hung motionless\\nagainst the pale blue curtain of the sky, and a smiling moon\\npeeped down between the clouds at the secrets of the world\\nbelow. The Whangpoo was a glistening ribbon of drab yellow;\\nit flowed with a quict contentment. A steam-launch pushed its\\nleisurely way through the smooth waters of the river with an\\noccasional majestic hoot. Its deck was ablaze with a galaxy\\nof red and green lights which vied in the cool stillness of the\\nnight with the stars shimmering overhead. It was evidently a\\npleasure-boat.\\n\\nThe boat was now passing Kaochiaosha, where the river was\\nwide, and moving solemnly northwards, while the busy industrial\\nand commercial heart of Shanghai faded into the distance behind\\nit. The tall chimney of the power station, the last outpost of\\nindustrial Shanghai, swept past in the twinkling of an eye. The\\nfields on either bank seemed veiled in a thin grey haze as they\\nslept in the moonlight.\\n\\nThe revellers on deck were mildly drunk. More than twenty\\nminutes of uninterrupted laughter and joking had tired their\\ntongues and they were now gazing out in silence at the mysterious\\nmoonlit world around them, their wine-flushed faces gradually\\ntaking on a look of frustrated boredom. Now that they were\\ntemporarily removed from the vortex of business competition,\\nnow that their eyes were suddenly opened to the quiet calm of\\nthe moonlit countryside, it was only natural that they should\\nfeel dejected as they licked the wounds they had received ia\\nthe daily battles of the business world. In addition to the feeling\\nof frustrated boredom, they now began to feel pessimistic about\\nthe vicissitudes of life and to itch with the desire for something\\nfresh to give them the excitement they needed.\\n\\nOne member of the party was suffering worse than the others\\n—Wu Sun-fu. Tonight’s celebration had been at his suggestion\\nand his guests were his old friends Sun Chi-jen, Wang Ho-fu,\\nand Han Meng-hsiang, as well as one woman, Hsu Man-li. It\\nwas in her honour that this special party was being held, for,\\naccording to her, it was at this hour of the rising of the moon\\njust twenty-four years before that she had first seen the light\\nin this weary world. The bunting and the coloured lights, the\\nwine and the expensive food, then, were all to celebrate her\\nbirthday. In addition, Sun Chi-jen had wired his agent to send\\ndown his new steam-launch for this special occasion.\\n\\nThe boat was going even slower now, and the engine chugged\\nmonotonously beneath them as if it were singing a lullaby. The\\nskipper, sensing the mood of the party on deck, had cut down\\nthe speed to please them, and the boat was now so steady that\\none could have balanced an egg on one end on the deck.\\nSuddenly, Wu Sun-fu turned to Sun Chi-jen:\\n\\n“How many knots can this boat do at full speed?”\\n\\n“Oh, thirteen, I should think. She might even get up to\\nfifteen or sixteen when she’s drawing as little water as she is\\nnow—though she’d roll like the very devil. Why—do you want\\nto go fast?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled and nodded. Sun Chi-jen had read his\\nthoughts and realized that his jaded spirits craved some violent\\nstimulus—speed, power, anything. But Wang Ho-fu disagreed\\nand offered a more practical suggestion:\\n\\n“We\\'re the only boat for miles; there’d ‘be no fun in racing\\nher here. Let’s go back along the Bund where there’s plenty\\nof life and bustle, and then give her her head. That’d be more\\nto the point!”\\n\\n“There’s no need to go back so soon!” said Hsu Man-li in her\\nclear, tinkling voice. “Let’s run down to Woosung where the\\nriver meets the sea before we turn back—and at full speed,\\ntoo!”\\n\\nEveryone clapped their approval, for just before, when they\\nhad been laughing and joking, they had agreed that the slightest\\nwhim of the “guest of honour” should be their command. Ac-\\ncordingly, the order for full speed ahead was immediately given,\\nand the engine revved up and the boat began trembling as if\\n\\nin the throes of malaria; white foam churned up a foot high\\naround the cutwater, and the bow-wave trailed out far across\\nthe river in a long white V. The waters of the Whangpoo\\nsplashed and gurgled around the laughing, wine-flushed party\\non deck.\\n\\n“We must do something to keep alive the memory of this gala\\nnight!” shouted Han Meng-hsiang, holding his glass aloft. “I\\nsuggest that Sun Chi-jen should rename this boat the Man-li.\\nAll agreed?”\\n\\nJust then the boat suddenly swerved and Han Meng-hsiang\\nlost his balance and fell against Wang Ho-fu, while the glass\\nof champagne splashed on Hsu Man-li’s head and drenched her\\nlong, wavy hair. Exclamations of dismay came from Wu Sun-\\nfu and others, then everyone burst out laughing. As she laughed,\\nHsu Man-li tried to shake the wine out of her hair and protested\\nin a coquettish voice:\\n\\n“you are a clumsy oaf, Meng-hsiang! My hair’s soaked! Now\\nyou\\'ll have to suck it dry!”\\n\\nShe was only joking, but Wang Ho-fu pretended to take it\\nseriously and clapped his hands for silence.\\n\\n“Did you hear that, everybody? Her Highness commands Han\\nMeng-hsiang to lap up the wine in her hair! It’s a great honour\\nto be entrusted with such a task, Meng-hsiang! You must carry\\nit out without delay—”\\n\\n“Don\\'t be silly!” interrupted Hsu Man-li, kicking at Wang Ho-\\nfu’s shin under the table to stop him. “I was only joking! I\\ndidn’t mean it!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu pretended not to hear and urged Han Meng-hsiang\\nall the harder to “Obey Her Highness at once!” Wu Sun-fu\\nand Sun Chi-jen clapped and cheered him on. Now that some-\\nthing new had come along to stimulate their jaded spirits, they\\nwere unwilling to let it go, especially in their present state of\\ntipsiness. Han Meng-hsiang was smiling darkly and seemed to\\nhave no objection. The only difficulty was that Hsu Man-li,\\nfor all her rich experience of men, had become strangely shy.\\nShe smiled woodenly and flashed a glance round the men\\'s\\nfaces: three pairs of eyes, bloodshot with drinking, watched her\\nclosely, as if she were a monkey about to perform. She had a\\nfleeting sensation, a feeling that she was being used as a play-\\n\\nthing, but this feeling was too short-lived to annoy her. She\\npursed her lips in a smile and giggled. She found it rather em-\\nbarrassing to be forced into a game of this sort and to be watched\\nover while she played it.\\n\\nNevertheless, Wang Ho-fu had already gone into action. He\\nheld Han Meng-hsiang’s head between his hands and pushed it\\nclose to Hsu Man-li’s face. She giggled and leant away, only\\nto find herself pushing against Wu Sun-fu’s shoulder. Laughing\\nnoisily, Wu Sun-fu caught hold of her head and held it to Han\\nMeng-hsiang’s lips. Sun Chi-jen now assumed the role of master\\nof ceremonies and shouted above the noise of their laughter:\\n\\n“Suck one! Suck two! Suck—three! Ceremony completed!”\\n\\n“Thank you very much, the lot of you! Now my hair’s dirtier\\nthan ever! First champagne and then this!’ she protested coyly\\nas she tidied her hair, then began giggling again. As if hoping\\nto carry the joke further, Wang Ho-fu quickly put in:\\n\\n“All right, then, we’ have another try, but this time you\\nmustn’t pretend to be so shy!”\\n\\n“That\\'ll do!” said Wu Sun-fu, who felt the joke had gone far\\nenough and wanted a change. ‘“Man-li has broken the rules\\nherself, so I suggest we think up a punishment for her.”\\n\\nHan Meng-hsiang, who was fond of dancing, suggested that\\nshe should be made to dance a foxtrot, but Sun Chi-jen was afraid\\nthere might be an accident on his boat and hurriedly objected.\\n\\n“No, you can’t do that! The boat’s rolling terribly, and it’s\\nno joke to fall into the Whangpoo! Let’s let her off for now—\\nwe can always think of something later on.”\\n\\nThe steam-launch had now reached the Woosung delta. Three\\nor four foreign warships were moored in the river, the lights\\non top of their mainmasts gleaming against the sky like unusually\\nbright stars. The clear notes of a bugle-call came to their ears\\nfrom one of the ships. Then there was a sudden silence. As\\nfar as the eye could see there was nothing but water and cold\\nmoonlight. The launch slowed down as it swept round in a wide\\ncircle at the river’s mouth, then headed back up the river towards\\nShanghai. Suddenly Wang Ho-fu said in a serious voice:\\n\\n“This afternoon two American gun-boats and three Japanese\\ntorpedo-boats left for Hankow under urgent orders, though I\\ndon’t know what for. Chi-jen, has your company had any\\n\\nnews from Changsha? I hear they’re in a tight spot there\\nagain.”\\n\\n“l’ve had a wire, but it doesn’t say anything much.”\\n\\n“Perhaps they couldn’t give any details because of the cen-\\nsorship. So far as I can make out, the Reds are getting ready\\nto attack Changsha. Hem!”\\n\\n“That’s just another Japanese rumour,” said Han Meng-hsiang.\\n“The Japanese news agency’s always harping on the ‘Red menace\\nin Kiangsi and Hunan,’ and telling us that Changsha is threatened\\n—and Chian, too. The rumour was going round the Exchange\\ntoday, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting the market at all. In\\nfact, the market’s quite steady today!”\\n\\nHe yawned, and the yawn proved infectious: Hsu Man-li was\\nthe first to go down, and Sun Chi-jen came precariously near it,\\nbut managed to suppress it. He turned to Wu Sun-fu.\\n\\n“Everything the Japanese say isn’t necessarily a rumour,\\nthough. As a matter of fact, both those two provinces are in\\na bad way. With the war between the North and the South\\ndragging on and on, they keep sending troops from the two\\nprovinces to the front, and never send any back to replace them.\\nAs the garrisons become depleted, they find it more and more\\ndifficult to cope with the Reds, who\\'re just overrunning the\\nwhole place. There’s no telling how it’s all going to end!”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a job to say what\\'s going to come of it all,” Wu\\nSun-fu agreed. “When the war first broke out, everybody ex-\\npected that it would be over in two months at the latest, but\\nhere we are in the third month and still the end’s not in sight.\\nThough the casualties at the front are really frightful! They\\neven make an old campaigner like Colonel Lei shake his head\\nwhen you mention them. These army people have estimated\\nthat the total number of men called up by both sides is three\\nmillion, and that the number of casualties to date is at least\\nthree hundred thousand! It must be the biggest war we\\'ve ever\\nhad!”\\n\\nAs Wu Sun-fu said this, he looked thoroughly dispirited; his\\neyes were closed, and he was stroking his chin. Hsu Man-li, who\\nhad not spoken for some time, suddenly joined in the conversa-\\n\\ntion.\\n\\n“Oh, they’re a terrible sight, all these wounded soldiers! They\\njust don’t look like human beings! Ship after ship and train\\nafter train of them, every day they’re coming in! Just look at\\nall the military hospitals along the railways to Nanking and\\nHangchow—every city and town is full of them. When the\\ntemples are full they put them in the guildhalls, and when the\\nguildhalls are full they put them in the schools. Sometimes\\nthere’s nowhere to put them, so they just have to stay on station\\nplatforms for days on end in the wind and rain! Soochow and\\nHangchow were always called paradises on earth, but just at\\nthe moment these two cities are more like hell with all the\\nwounded soldiers they’ve got!”\\n\\n“I should think the war will be over by the end of July,\\nthough,” Wu Sun-fu said optimistically, forcing a smile. “They\\ncan’t go on much longer with casualties as heavy as that!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu shook his head in disagreement.\\n\\n“Not necessarily, ’m afraid! I’ve heard that they’re digging\\nthe most up-to-date kind of defence-works all round Hsuchow\\nunder the supervision of a foreign military adviser. He guaran-\\ntees that the Central Army can hold this defence-line for at least\\na year! Just think, another year! They say that this defence-\\nline alone will cost three million dollars—some say five million!\\nSo it looks as if the war will still be on when New Year’s Day\\ncomes round. What a mess!”\\n\\n“However heavy the casualties are, there are plenty of new\\nrecruits to replace them!” said Han Meng-hsiang. “There are\\nrecruiting stations at Chinkiang, Soochow, Hangchow and Ningpo,\\nand each station pulls in from three hundred to a thousand men\\nevery day and sends them up to Shanghai and then on to Nanking\\nfor training. They’ve also got a recruiting banner up in Shang-\\nhai North Railway Station; they enrol a matter of two or three\\nhundred recruits every day there!”\\n\\nWhether he realized it or not, Han Meng-hsiang had dealt\\na mortal blow to Wu Sun-fu’s optimism with this.\\n\\nA silence fell over the party. Was the civil war going to drag\\non indefinitely? This was the question which lay behind the\\nglances that passed between the five of them. The chugging of\\nthe engine had now changed to a higher, softer key, and every\\nbeat jabbed at their frayed nerves and added to their depression\\n\\nWith Hsu Man-li and Han Meng-hsiang this depression was\\nnothing more than a passing mood which quickly evaporated; but\\nit had come to stay with the other three—Wu Sun-fu, Sun Chi-\\njen and Wang Ho-fu—and became worse as time went on. If\\nthe war should drag on for a long time yet, their businesses would\\nbe ruined!\\n\\nA thin mist now hung over the river, and in the distance\\nlightning flashed and thunder began to rumble. The wind was\\nrising, a violent southeaster which met them head-on. The\\nsteam-launch forged angrily ahead in the teeth of the wind,\\nand battled against the noisy onslaught of the waves. Presently,\\nthe gay, twinkling lights of Shanghai could be seen coming nearer\\nand nearer through the thin mist.\\n\\n“What a miserable lot we are!’ came Hsu Man-li’s tinkling\\nvoice, breaking the tense, gloomy atmosphere with its cheerful-\\nness. “What’s the matter with you all? Have you been struck\\ndumb?”\\n\\nIt annoyed her to think that their evening of gaiety had been\\nmarred by the mention of wounded soldiers and defence-lines,\\nand she was now determined to use all her charm to dispel the\\nawkward silence that hung over them. Han Meng-hsiang was,\\nas usual, quick to respond.\\n\\n“Let’s have one drink all round,” he suggested, “and then each\\nof us in turn drinks a toast to our guest of honour. How’s that?”\\n\\nNo one disagreed with this suggestion. Though Wu Sun-fu\\nand his companions realized that it would take more than a\\nfew drinks to dispel their low spirits, they were agreeable to\\nhaving a drink if only to take their minds off their troubles for\\none brief moment and replace their depression with a temporary\\ngaiety. When the toasts had been drunk, Wang Ho-fu was ready\\nwith another suggestion.\\n\\n“So much for the drinks; now for a bit of fun! Chi-jen, you\\ntell the skipper to order full speed ahead—as fast as she\\'ll\\ngo! Man-li, you stand on the table on one leg and keep the\\nother leg up.—You needn’t be afraid of falling off, because we\\'ll\\nstand one on each side of the table. If you fall, the one who\\ncatches you will have good luck all the year and make his fortune\\nthis month!”\\n\\n“No, I can’t do a thing like that!” she protested coyly. “We\\'re\\njust coming into the busy part of the river, and I don’t want to\\nmake a fool of myself!”\\n\\nShe turned to slip away, but the four men just laughed and\\napplauded her insistently. Still laughing, Wu Sun-fu grasped\\nher unexpectedly round the waist and planted her on the table\\nwith a thud. He held her there to stop her getting down and\\ncalled to the others:\\n\\n“Every man to his post! And remember, Man-li, no favour-\\nitism! Come on, everybody!”\\n\\nThere was no escape for her now, and she did not want to\\nescape, but she was laughing so much that she felt weak at the\\nknees and could not even stand up. The four men took up their\\npositions, roaring with laughter and urging her on. The boat\\nwas now racing madly like a runaway horse. Hsu Man-li had\\nonly just stood up and raised one leg, when a gust of wind\\ncaught her dress and blew it up over her face. She gave a lurch\\nand toppled towards one corner, where she was caught by Sun\\nChi-jen and Han Meng-hsiang together.\\n\\n“That’s the first prize gone!” laughed Wang Ho-fu, clapping\\nhis hands. “Half each! Up you go again and we\\'ll see who gets\\nthe second prize!”\\n\\nJust then, a sudden blast from the boat’s siren startled the\\nmerry-makers and the next moment the boat jarred violently\\nagainst something and seemed to rear up in the water. The\\nsudden jolt sent the glasses and dishes on the table crashing to\\nthe deck. Everyone was thrown off balance, and Han Meng-\\nhsiang, who was near the side, nearly went overboard. They\\nwere all pale with fright. The boat had stopped, and members\\nof the crew were running along the sides with long bamboo poles\\nin their hands. A muffled shout came from the river:\\n\\n“Help! Help!”\\n\\nThe launch had hit a sampan and overturned it. Now Hsu\\nMan-li could not give the “second prize.” Wu Sun-fu frowned\\nand smiled grimly to himself.\\n\\nOne of the crew managed to hook the sampan with his bamboo\\npole. In the water, clinging to the stern of the sampan was a\\nman with only his head showing above the water. He was the\\nsampan man, the only one who had fallen into the water. Ten\\n\\nminutes later, the launch was speeding on its way again and\\nheading for the Customs Jetty. The five people on deck were\\nlaughing noisily once again: they dared not stop, for if they\\ndid they would immediately find themselves in the grip of a\\nterrible despondency and the frightening uncertainties of the\\nmilitary situation and the crisis in business and industry would\\nagain be growing at their minds.\\n\\n*\\n\\nIt was midnight. Most of the inhabitants of the industrial\\nand financial world of Shanghai were already asleep and groan-\\ning through nightmares of cut-throat competition, but the bar\\nof the night club still echoed with the clinking of knives and\\nforks and the popping of corks. Wu Sun-fu was gazing absently\\nat the people passing by him in the bar, his left hand support-\\ning his chin, and his right over the top of a wineglass. He and\\nWang Ho-fu had got through half a bottle of port between them,\\nbut their faces were not flushed in the least. The port might\\nhave been so much pure water for all the effect it had on their\\njaded spirits. To make things worse, they had no idea why they\\nshould feel so depressed.\\n\\nAfter landing at the Customs Jetty, they had all gone off to\\nHsu Man-li’s place and spent an hilarious half-hour there. After\\nthat they had paid a visit to the famous house of romance known\\nas No. 94, where they had set Madame a very difficult task.\\nFinally they had come to this night club, where they had spent\\nthe last half-hour. They had played cards and dice, but none\\nof these amusements had been of the slightest use in reviving\\ntheir spirits. They sat there as depressed as ever, feeling as if\\ntheir chests were congested and making their breathing difficult.\\nThey felt prickly all over and it was an effort to move. What\\nirked them most was that their usually alert minds seemed\\nclogged and numb. Only the strongest stimulus could rouse them\\nto mental activity, and then only for a moment.\\n\\n“Whew! I feel whacked!” Wu Sun-fu muttered to himself\\nand took a sip at his glass. He was still staring dazedly at the\\nblurred shapes passing in and out of the bar.\\n\\n“I feel washed out, too,” yawned Wang Ho-fu. “Felt washed\\nout for the last five or six days.”\\n\\nTheir eyes met and parted at once, and each resumed his\\nabsent-minded staring. They might just as well have not spoken,\\nfor neither of them was really conscious of what they were\\nsaying or hearing. In fact, their conscious minds were a com-\\nplete blank.\\n\\nSuddenly, a tall, sturdy figure appeared in the doorway with\\nthree or four people clustered round him. They brushed past\\nWu Sun-fu’s table, talking and laughing, and vanished into the\\nroom at the back of the bar. This sudden irruption seemed to\\njar the numbed nerves of Wu Sun-fu and Wang Ho-fu back to\\nlife, for they exchanged glances and smiled dismally at each\\nother. Wu Sun-fu muttered as if to himself:\\n\\n“Wonder if it was. Looked like Chao Po-tao.”\\n\\n“Chao Po-tao?” echoed Wang Ho-fu, instinctively glancing\\ntowards the door of the backroom, then asked:\\n\\n“Who were the others?”\\n\\n“I didn’t notice. Anyway, I didn’t see the old chap among\\nthem — Shang Chung-li.”\\n\\n“I saw somebody wearing glasses. What’s his name, now—\\nthat’s it, Li Yu-ting, the one who’s always at your place.”\\n\\n“Are you sure it’s him?” said Wu Sun-fu, then chuckled and\\npicked up his glass for another sip. Just then the man in\\nglasses came out of the backroom and came straight across to\\ntheir table. It was Li Yu-ting, after all. He had come back\\nspecially to pay his respects to the two men of property. Wang\\nHo-fu laughed.\\n\\n“Talk of the devil! Fancy meeting a university professor in\\na night club! Il) have it put in the papers tomorrow!”\\n\\n“Don’t worry! Our lawyer friend Chiu Chun dragged me\\nhere. Have you seen him?”\\n\\n“No, but we saw Chao Po-tao when you came with him a\\nminute ago.”\\n\\nAt this chance remark of Wu Sun-fu’s Li Yu-ting unexpectedly\\nblushed to the tips of his ears. He felt as guilty and embarrassed\\nas a woman whose husband has caught her with a lover. He\\nforced a smile and hurriedly changed the subject:\\n\\n“IT hear the government’s moving to Hangchow. It may only\\nbe a rumour, but everybody’s talking about it. Haven’t you\\nheard about it?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu and Wang Ho-fu shook their heads. They received\\nthe news with a curious mixture of delight and despondency.\\nLi Yu-ting went on:\\n\\n“The fact that the North\\'s going to set up their own govern-\\nment, and that the Central Government\\'s moving to Hangchow,\\nmeans that neither side’s willing to make peace and that they’re\\nboth determined to fight it out. I tell you, Sun-fu, the war’s\\ngoing to drag on—perhaps even six months or a year! It’s going\\nto be the worst stretch of fighting since the republic was set up.\\nThere’s never been such a vast number of men called up before,\\nand the front line is so long that all the central provinces have\\nbeen caught in the maelstrom. And then there are the Reds\\nmaking havoc everywhere. In fact, the outlook couldn’t be\\nblacker!”\\n\\n“We\\'ll manage somehow!” Wang Ho-fu said with a sigh. He\\nwas more disheartened now than he had ever been. Li Yu-\\nting felt sorry for him. He turned to look at Wu Sun-fu and\\nsaw a face as worried as Wang Ho-fu’s. Li Yu-ting had never\\nseen Wu Sun-fu looking as miserable as this before. He sighed\\ndespite himself and tried to think of something to say to dispel\\nthe unpleasant atmosphere that hung over them. Presently he\\nspoke again:\\n\\n“Por all that the stock market’s still firm: no sign of a slump\\nyet. That shows that the general public are still quite optimistic\\nabout the future!”\\n\\n“Ha ha! You’re right they are!” Wu Sun-fu laughed with a\\nsudden bitterness. He gave Wang Ho-fu a knowing look. Wang\\nHo-fu missed it, but Li Yu-ting noticed it and realized at once\\nthat he had inadvertently touched Wu Sun-fu’s tender spot. He\\nquickly tried to pass it off with a forced laugh and changed the\\nsubject again, this time to Chiu Chun, the lawyer.\\n\\n“A native bank down in Nantao went broke, over four hundred\\nthousand dollars in debt, Four-fifths of the money belongs to\\nthe depositors, who are getting Chiu Chun to sue the bank for\\nthem. As a matter of fact, Sun-fu, your relative Fan Po-wen\\nhappens to be one of the claimants. I hear he\\'s reading up civil\\nlaw now, instead of writing poetry. They say the bank lost a lot\\nin the stock market.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu nodded and smiled. He was amused to hear that\\nit had taken the loss of his bank deposits to make Fan Po-wen\\ntake up law. Wang Ho-fu said cynically, “If nobody ever went\\nbroke, nobody would ever make a fortune! It’s hard luck on the\\nsmall depositors, though!”\\n\\n“Yes, it is,” agreed Li Yu-ting. “My own feeling is that for\\nthe last few years the money business in Shanghai has been\\ndeveloping in the wrong direction. I think the development of\\nindustry is the only use of money which will benefit the nation’s\\neconomy. As it is, industry in this city is going from bad to\\nworse. A case in point is the cigarette industry—during the last\\ntwo or three years quite a large number of new cigarette fac-\\ntories have sprung up in Shanghai, but they soon find they\\nhaven’t a chance against foreign competition. And now, on top\\nof that, they’re being hit by the war. Even the China Tobacco\\nCompany, with the best-known brands and the biggest capital,\\nis shutting down its Shanghai factory for the time being. Such\\nis the fate of the luxury industries.”\\n\\nHaving finished his impassioned harangue, Li Yu-ting stood\\nup to go, then suddenly bent down and whispered in Wu Sun-\\nfu’s ear:\\n\\n“Chao Po-tao’s got something big up his sleeve. He wants to\\ntalk it over with you. I wonder if you mind coming into the\\nbackroom? It’s quieter in there than it is here.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was rather taken aback for the moment, and did\\nnot reply at once. Li Yu-ting chuckled as much as to say, “Think\\nit over” and walked off.\\n\\nFor a moment Wu Sun-fu just sat there gazing at Li Yu-ting’s\\nreceding back. He was puzzled. Why should Chao Po-tao want\\nto see him all of a sudden? And why should Li Yu-ting be so\\nfurtive about it, as if he did not want Wang Ho-fu to hear? He\\nglanced round at Wang Ho-fu and decided he had better go and\\nsee what Chao Po-tao’s game was.\\n\\n“Ho-fu, Li Yu-ting’s just told me that Chao Po-tao’s got some-\\nthing to discuss with us. Let’s go through and see him.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t think you’ll need me. I’m going to have a look\\nat the roulette table. So Chao Po-tao’s playing the Napoleon,\\neh? He’s won his battle and now he’s going to dictate his terms!”’\\n\\nThe two men glanced at each other and laughed as if they\\nfelt some slight relief from their depression.\\n\\nSo Wu Sun-fu went alone. He found Chao Po-tao at a small\\ntable tucked away in a corner and sat down with him, trying\\nhis best to smile calmly. Since their joint speculation in govern-\\nment bonds a month before the two of them had met from time\\nto time at social functions, but had never exchanged more than a\\nfew casual words. Now they had met once again for a serious\\nprivate discussion. Chao Po-tao was his usual cheerful, straight-\\nforward self. He did not beat about the bush, and made no at-\\ntempt to disguise the fact that he knew he had finally won.\\n\\n“I\\'ll be quite frank with you, Sun-fu. It’s time we wrote off\\nall our old scores! Though there are one or two things I must\\nclear up before we start. In the first place, I admit I’ve had a\\nhand in organizing a banking consortium—a sort of a trust, if\\nyou like. It’s a fairly comprehensive sort of thing, but we’re not\\nbarring anybody who wants to go in with us and we don’t\\nnecessarily intend to swallow anybody who prefers to go ahead\\non his own. We\\'ve never at any time tried to bring pressure to\\nbear on you, Sun-fu, and we’ve never had any real interest in\\nthe silk industry. If you’ve been imagining that we\\'ve got\\ndesigns on you, Sun-fu, then you\\'ve got a suspicious mind!—”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu smiled and shrugged his shoulders. Chao Po-tao\\ndid not return his smile, and his keen eyes searched Wu Sun-fu’s\\nface. He drew hard at his cigar and went on:\\n\\n“You don’t believe me, Sun-fu? Just as you like, Though\\nT’ll tell you this: I was only pulling your Jeg with all that\\nbusiness about Chu Yin-chiu’s loan. The last thing I want is\\nto make things awkward for you! If you imagined that I had\\nsome ulterior motive, well, that’s quite understandable—I’d\\nprobably react in the same way if I were in your place. And\\nnow let\\'s pass on to the other thing. You people suspect that\\nI’m leaving no stone unturned to wreck the Yi Chung Company.\\nHa ha! Yes, I admit I’ve done some underhand things, but only\\non a very small scale, never anything serious. You think I\\'m\\nenforcing an ‘economic blockade’ against you behind the scenes:\\nyes, Sun-fu, I expect I could if I really wanted to, but as it hap-\\npens I don’t want to! It would be pointless to stab you in the\\nback when you\\'re one of us!”\\n\\n“Ha ha! { see, Po-tao, it seems we\\'ve all been wronging you!\\nAll one big misunderstanding, eh?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu raised his eyebrows as he laughed, but Chao Po-tao’s\\nexpression remained serious.\\n\\n“Not at all!” he quickly replied. “I don’t mean that you’ve mis-\\nunderstood every single thing I\\'ve done in the past. I only want\\nto make you understand that we’re not necessarily inveterate\\nenemies, that we haven’t necessarily got to go two entirely dif-\\nferent ways, and that there’s room for both of us in this world.\\nYou see, even if your company prospers, it doesn’t mean to say\\nthat I’m going to lose by it, so why should I go to the trouble of\\nmaking every effort to thwart you? As a matter of fact, I’ve\\nnever tried to do anything of the sort!”\\n\\nChao Po-tao’s gloating tone of voice was more than Wu Sun-fu\\ncould bear, and he demanded acidly, “Surely you didn’t send for\\nme just to tell me all this, Po-tao?”\\n\\n“Partly, yes. All right then, Sun-fu, let bygones be bygones.\\n— Actually, there was something else I wanted to talk over at\\nthe same time, but as you seem fed up with the sound of my voice\\nI don’t think I should bother you with it. You know me, Sun-fu:\\nI like to have things straight out and not beat about the bush.\\nThe reason I asked you over was to see whether we couldn\\'t get\\ntogether and co-operate from now on —”\\n\\n“Now, Po-tao,” interrupted Wu Sun-fu, “if you\\'ve got something\\nelse to talk over with me, let’s hear it.”\\n\\nHe put on a smile, trying to be calm, but he felt extremely\\nuneasy. He suddenly remembered Tu Chu-chai’s efforts at\\nmediation when he had first clashed with Chao Po-tac. At that\\ntime he had insisted on a policy of “winning a victory before\\nnegotiating a peace so that Chao Po-tao will never get the upper\\nhand,” and so had rejected Tu Chu-chai’s good offices, never ex-\\npecting that their positions would be so quickly reversed and that\\nChao Po-tao, as the victor, would be offering him a chance to\\n“co-operate” with him. Wu Sun-fu could scarcely believe that\\nfate could be so unkind to him.\\n\\nWith a faint smile, as if he could see what was going on in Wu\\nSun-fu’s mind, Chao Po-tao said quite frankly:\\n\\n“The third thing actually is a case of misunderstanding. You\\nthink I’ve taken Tu Chu-chai away from you, whereas, in point\\n\\nof fact, I’ve done nothing of the kind. On the other hand, you’ve\\nactually hooked Han Meng-hsiang from me! I don’t mind telling\\nyou, Sun-fu, I couldn’t help admiring the skilful way you did it!”\\n\\nAs Wu Sun-fu listened, his heart thumped and a look of appre-\\nhension came into his face. He quickly tried to pass it off with\\na loud laugh. Then he put out a feeler:\\n\\n“Han Meng-hsiang’s not the only one! I’ve also bought over\\nsomeone even more important than him!”\\n\\n“Oh yes, a woman, perhaps, but that doesn’t count for much.\\nI\\'d be extremely grateful if you would take some of them off my\\nhands! I’ve got more women than I know what to do with!”\\n\\nIt was now Chao Po-tao’s turn to laugh to hide his discomfiture,\\nbut Wu Sun-fu was not deceived, and it was now his turn to feel\\ntriumphant. His self-confidence was gradually returning and he\\nwas managing to shake off his defeatist mood. He braced him-\\nself up and took the offensive by returning without more ado to\\nthe question of “co-operation.”\\n\\n“You\\'re a good guesser! We\\'ve been quite successful with our\\npolicy of buying people over! You kriow, Po-tao, I think even\\nyou have got your price! Now I’m plain-spoken like you and I\\ndon’t believe in wasting breath, so let\\'s have your terms for\\n‘co-operation’ straight out. If they’re reasonable, I\\'ll consider\\nthem seriously.”\\n\\n“Well, then, in a nutshell, I\\'ll recommend a certain banking\\nconsortium to make the Yi Chung Trust Company a loan of three\\nmillion dollars, the first instalment being half a million. The\\ncondition is that all the assets of the company should be placed\\nwith it as a security.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu listened attentively, his eyes riveted on Chao Po-\\ntao’s face. When the latter had finished, Wu Sun-fu suddenly\\nthrew back his head and roared with laughter, then shrugged his\\nshoulders. Chao Po-tao’s expression did not change; he puffed\\ncalmly at his cigar and waited quietly for an answer. When his\\nlaughter had subsided, Wu Sun-fu put on a serious expression\\nand exclaimed:\\n\\n“you\\'re joking, Po-tao! Our company’s policy is one of gradual\\ndevelopment—we\\'ll expand our business as we go along. Ad-\\nmittedly we’ve got big things planned for the future, but just at\\n\\nthe moment we don’t really need a loan of three million. In fact,\\nwe\\'ve got surplus capital that we can’t find a use for!”\\n\\n“You’ve got me wrong, I’m afraid. The total amount of the\\nloan would be three million, but the first instalment will only\\nbe a matter of half a million. How the second would be made\\nis left open. You\\'re an old hand at the game, Sun-fu, so you\\nmust probably understand that this loan would in actual fact be\\na loan of half a million. The only thing is that the banking con-\\nsortium would have priority in making further loans to bring the\\ntotal up to three million if necessary.”\\n\\n“But the company couldn’t even use a loan of half a million!”\\n\\n“You sure?”\\n\\n“Quite sure!” said Wu Sun-fu firmly, steeling himself to say it:\\nyet hardly were the words out of his mouth when his heart missed\\na beat: he realized that Chao Po-tao was trying to trap him in\\nthe same way as he himself had trapped Chu Yin-chiu just a short\\nwhile before! He realized that, if he refused, Chao Po-tao would\\norganize a full-scale financial blockade against the company in\\nreal earnest. With the war dragging on and the eight factories\\nsuffering from over-production, such a full-scale financial blockade\\nwould give the Yi Chung Company a choice between closing down\\ntheir factories and selling out. Chao Po-tao’s offer, then, was\\nthe first warning shot as his financial trust went into action!\\n\\nChao Po-tao smiled and blew out a cloud of smoke before press-\\ning home the attack. “So we can’t co-operate after all! Your\\ncompany is a promising one, and it seems a pity to drive it on\\nto the rocks! You’ve put a lot of hard work into your company,\\nSun-fu. I can’t see you letting it all go by the board! Why not\\nthink it over carefully before you let me know what your answer\\nis? Now let’s be perfectly honest about it, Sun-fu: you know\\nas well as I do that your company is in financial difficulties.\\nThere’s every prospect of the war dragging on and spreading to\\nother parts of the country, which means that the company’s fac-\\ntories won’t find a market for their products before the end of the\\nyear. So think it over carefully, Sun-fu, and let me know what\\nyou decide.”\\n\\n“Mm-—” grunted Wu Sun-fu vaguely, as he suddenly suc-\\ncumbed. Something seemed to snap inside him and his strength\\ndeserted him. His self-confidence had gone, and with it his will\\n\\nto resist. One thought was going through his mind: What about\\na conditional surrender?\\n\\nSuddenly, he stood up, a wry smile on his lips. He had re-\\ncaptured something of his ebbing will-power and was determined\\nnot to let Chao Po-tao see his dejection and his readiness to sur-\\nrender. He clapped Chao Po-tao on the shoulder and said\\ncheerfully:\\n\\n“Say what you will, Po-tao, we all have our own ideas about\\nthe military situation! It may well be that something will hap-\\npen which will bring the war to a sudden end! As far as our\\ncompany’s concerned, we don’t worry much about it. Still, we\\ndon’t mind absorbing a little more capital when we can to ex-\\npand the business. I\\'ll put your suggestion to the board of direc-\\ntors tomorrow and see you again later.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu rounded off the conversation with another roar of\\nlaughter and slipped away before Chao Po-tao could say another\\nword. He went back to Wang Ho-fu and told him briefly what\\nit was all about, then sat there frowning. For quite a while\\nneither of them spoke. Presently, Wang Ho-fu muttered through\\nclenched teeth:\\n\\n“PH be round at your place with Chi-jen tomorrow morning\\nfor a conference!”\\n\\n*\\n\\nBy the time Wu Sun-fu got home it was half past one in the\\nmorning. Both stars and moon were hidden by the dark bank of\\ncloud that covered the sky, and in his gloomy garden the wind\\nwas soughing mournfully among the trees. His wife and all the\\nothers were still out, and the servants of both sexes were gam-\\nbling in the porter’s lodge, huddled together in a circle, and shout-\\ning and laughing excitedly. They did not realize Wu Sun-fu\\nwas home until the chauffeur had sounded the horn for the second\\ntime. They immediately broke up in a panic and scurried back\\nto their various places of work. Wu Sun-fu had guessed what\\nwas going on, and when he got out of the car his face was as\\nblack as thunder, for he had strictly forbidden his servants to\\ngamble!\\n\\nWhen he found that his wife and everybody else were out he\\nbecam2 engrier still. “What sort of a home is this to come home\\nto? he roared as he stalked into the drawing-room and glared\\n\\nat the furniture, the carpet, the tablecloths, the sofa-covers and\\nthe curtains, searching for a pretext to vent his rage on the ser-\\nvants. As his angry voice rang through the house, the servants\\nlooked apprehensively at one another. With the wind moaning\\nin the rustling trees outside, everything seemed to be conspiring\\nto make this imposing mansion gloomy and depressing.\\n\\nAn apprehensive Kao Sheng came in with an armful of “in\\nmemoriam” scrolls which had been received in the course of the\\nday from friends and relatives (the memorial service for Old Mr.\\nWu\\'s death was approaching) and asked Wu Sun-fu whether he\\nwould like to glance at them. He was greeted with such a storm\\nof abuse that he did not know whether to laugh or ery, and the\\nservants now knew for certain that “the Master” was in an uglier\\nmood than usual tonight.\\n\\nKao Sheng’s rash intrusion, however, had given Wu Sun-fu the\\nnecessary outlet for his rage, and he now sprawled on a sofa, lost\\nin thought. He was not, of course, thinking about his father’s\\nmemorial service, for it was still five days away, and anyway,\\nhe had entrusted all the arrangements to his wife and sister: he\\nwas recalling how he and his friends had conceived the idea of\\nsetting up the Yi Chung Company on the day of the old man’s\\nfuneral, Now, even before the memorial service had been held,\\nall their ambitious plans were going up in smoke!\\n\\nHe now went back in his imagination to the corner of the bar\\nin the night club and went over his conversation with Chao Po-\\ntao again. He recalled with a pounding heart every threat Chao\\nPo-tao had made and every word he had said. His opponent had\\noffered him a clear choice: to surrender to him or to see the Yi\\nChung go bankrupt! These two alternatives chased each other\\nthrough his head in a merciless merry-go-round, so that he could\\nnot tear himself away from them and think of a third way out.\\nHis will to fight, to resist, had vanished without a trace. He was\\nno longer the man he had been two months before, at the funeral!\\nHis enthusiasm for his business was now quite dead, and if he\\nwanted to save the Yi Chung Company, it only was because he\\nwanted to salvage the capital of two hundred thousand dollars\\nwhich he had put into the company. And it was only the thought\\nof losing this money that made him now decide that he had no\\nother way out but to surrender to Chao Po-tao!\\n\\n“So that two months’ hard work just thrown away!? Wu Sun-\\nfu moaned to himself. His voice sounded strange in the silence\\nof the spacious room. It startled him, and he sprang up, unable\\nto believe that this weird sound had been his own voice, but there\\nwas nobody else in the room. The strong lights shone full on\\nhis face, and outside the windows were the shadowy shapes of a\\ncouple of servants standing by in case they were needed. He\\nfrowned and smiled grimly at himself. He lay down on the sofa\\nagain and suddenly recalled what he had told Tu Chu-chai not\\nlong before: “There are certain fly individuals in Shanghai who\\ntake a tumble-down house, redecorate it and patch it up, and then\\nlet it for a nice fat sum of key money. If the worst comes to the\\nworst, we can always follow their example and do the same with\\nthe eight factories.... If we make a good job of redecorating them\\nand patching them up, even the great Chao Po-tao himself will\\noffer us a good price for them!” He had said this in jest, just\\nto talk Tu Chu-chai round, little knowing then that it would\\nprove to be an oracle! Wu Sun-fu could not repress a smile as\\nhe thought of it. He was beginning to believe that everything\\nwas pre-ordained and that human efforts made no difference!\\n\\nThis thought made him feel slightly calmer. He was begin-\\nning to realize that Tu Chu-chai, timid though he was, could\\nsometimes be more far-sighted than he was, and so save himself\\na lot of trouble. He now began working out the total value of\\nthe assets of the Yi Chung Company and considering what terms\\nhe should hold out for when it came to actual negotiations with\\nChao Po-tao. Should he sell out for a lump sum and have done\\nwith it, or should he mortgage it and have it on his hands for a\\nwhile? His mind began to revive and his face became flushed\\nagain. He was now a different man not only from what he had\\nbeen two months before, when he had drawn up his gigantic\\nindustrial plans, but also from what he had been only three hours\\nbefore, when he had sat on the deck of the launch craving for\\nexcitement! He now had a “way out.” Though it meant sur-\\nrendering, it was much better than having no way out at all!\\n\\nHis reverie was interrupted when his younger sister Huei-\\nfang stole quietly in and stopped in front of him, gazing at him\\nwith anxious eyes.\\n\\n“Hullo, Huei-fang. Thought you’d be out,” he said casually\\nwhen he had made sure it actually was his sister and not his\\nimagination. He looked rather annoyed at the intrusion.\\n\\nHuei-fang said nothing, but sat down in a chair beside him\\nand heaved a sigh. Wu Sun-fu frowned and was about to speak\\nsharply to her, but changed his mind. He forced a smile, intend-\\ning to speak gently instead, but she spoke before he could.\\n“Sun-fu, I want to go back home to the country after father’s\\nmemorial service!”\\n\\n“What! Go back to the country?” Wu Sun-fu exclaimed in\\namazement. He was quite at a loss to understand how such a\\nstrange idea could suddenly have entered her head, and stared\\nat her in astonishment as she sat there, her face white and drawn.\\nShe hung her head and after a while she mumbled:\\n\\n“After all these years in the country with father I can’t settle\\ndown in Shanghai—”\\n\\n“Two months in Shanghai and you can’t settle down?” inter-\\nrupted Wu Sun-fu, then burst out laughing. He thought his\\nsister was being childish, but he was wrong. Huei-fang raised\\nher head and looked sharply at him. Her eyes had the same\\nimperious glint as her brother’s had when he was making a\\ndecision. She and her brother shared the same stubborn nature,\\nexcept that she usually held it in check. Now, however, her\\nlatent stubbornness was forcing itself to the fore.\\n\\n“No, I can’t settle down! I’ve been here long enough to be\\nabsolutely certain that I don’t like the place! It’s not that I don’t\\nlike the house or the food or anything like that, it’s something\\nelse that I can’t explain. Every day’s a nightmare—I just feel\\non edge all the time. There doesn’t seem to be anything to do\\nall day and I always feel at a loose end! I’ve asked Pei-shan\\nand the others, and they said they never feel like that. I suppose\\nI’m not fit for Shanghai because I have always stayed in the\\ncountry!”\\n\\nHuei-fang was exceptionally insistent this time. Suddenly her\\neyes reddened and tears rolled down her cheeks.\\n\\n“Well, Huei-fang—I—” Wu Sun-fu faltered, then stopped, not\\nknowing how to go on; his expression was strangely tender.\\nThough he usually treated his younger sister and brother in a\\nrather overbearing manner, he was very kind to them at heart\\n\\nand he always strove to make their life a happy one in the way\\nhe thought best, so it naturally upset him to hear his sister\\ncomplain of the dullness of her life, even though as an industrialist\\nhe could hardly be expected to understand a young girl’s com-\\nplex psychological processes and emotional conflicts!\\n\\nHuei-fang was a sensitive girl, and her brother’s gentle ex-\\npression suddenly reminded her of her mother and of the loving\\ncare she had lavished on her when she was alive. This was\\nthe first time for ten years that she had known such warmth of\\naffection, for it was the one thing she had missed while looking\\nafter her father all these years since her mother\\'s death. Her\\nfather had never been more to her than a teacher of religion, and\\nthere had always existed between him and her an impassable\\nbarrier, so it was not surprising that her brother’s new-found\\ngentleness should help to loosen her tongue.\\n\\n“when I first came to Shanghai, Sun-fu, I was afraid of every-\\nbody and everything. I was terribly nervous of meeting people\\nand going out. I’m not afraid any longer, but now I always\\nfeel so bored and depressed. A little while ago Pei-yao taught\\nme to play mahjong, but I very soon got fed up with it. I feel\\nfidgety all the time, as if I want something, but I don’t really\\nknow what it is I want. I just don’t seem to be able to interest\\nmyself in anything. I’m just on edge ali the time!”\\n\\n“Well, if you’ve no way of passing the time, Huei-fang,\\nwhy didn’t you go out with Pei-yao today for a change?”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s expression was gentler than ever now, almost\\nthe look of a loving mother; but then the businessman in him\\nwas becoming impatient with every passing minute.\\n\\n“J just don’t like going out—” Huei-fang said softly. She\\nsighed, but did not go on. She could not bring herself to say\\nwhat she was going to say. After all, a brother was a brother,\\nespecially when he was an elder brother who was usually very\\nstern and serious, and she could not very well expect him to\\nunderstand all the complicated things that were worrying her.\\nShe hung her head and her eyes became moist again. Suddenly,\\nshe saw in her mind’s-eye a young man and a girl—perhaps Tu\\nHsin-to and Lin Pei-shan— talking and flirting quite naturally\\nwith each other. They seemed so happy together, and she was\\nso lonely! She always felt there was a cord round her heart;\\n\\nwhen or how it had come to be there she did not know, but it\\nwas there all the time, binding her inside herself and preventing\\nher from being easy and natural with men and talking and\\nlaughing with them. She hated this cord that bound her, but\\nshe could not free herself from it. This was the struggle that\\nhad been going on in her mind and causing her so much misery.\\nAll she wanted was to hide herself away somewhere where she\\ncould shut out the world and all the heartache it caused her.\\nBut she had no one she could tell about her unhappiness. She\\nbit her lip, then looked up and said firmly:\\n\\n“Sun-ful I\\'m sure in myself that the only way is for me to\\ngo back to the country. There may be some other way out, but\\nthis is the only one I can think of at the moment. There’s noth-\\ning for it but to go back to the country! If I carry on like this,\\nPH go mad! I’ go mad, Sun-fu!”\\n\\n“Eh? I\\'ve never heard of such a thing!”\\n\\n“I know it sounds odd, but I just can’t understand why—”\\n\\n“There’s nothing to worry about, Huei-fang. Just stick it for\\na while and you\\'ll find you\\'ll get used to it. Look at Ah-hsuan,\\nhe’s all right!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu’s voice was taking on a tone of sternness now. He\\nshook himself impatiently and stood up, intending to put an end\\nto this dreary debate, but Huei-fang was adamant. She looked\\nher brother straight in the eye and said coldly, “If you won\\'t\\nlet me go home to the country, you can at least send me to a\\nlunatic asylum! I\\'ll go mad sooner or later if I stay here!”\\n\\n“Really, Huei-fang, I don’t know what to do with you! You\\'re\\nold enough to understand, but you don’t seem to be able to!\\nWhere do you imagine you’re going to live if you do go back?”\\n\\n“I could live at our old home all right!”\\n\\n“But won\\'t you be even more miserable living alone there?”\\n\\n“Well, I could go and live with Auntie at her place!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu shook his head and snorted, then began pacing up\\nand down. He was quite at a loss to deal with this stubborn\\nsister of his, and he was becoming angry again! He had always\\nbeen accustomed to being in charge of things and having every\\norder promptly obeyed. Besides, he could not imagine why his\\nsister should want to run away from life in Shanghai. He\\ncould only put it down to the fact that she had been living with\\n\\nher father too long and had acquired some of his eccentricities,\\none of which was an aversion to modern culture and city life.\\nAs it happened, this particular prejudice of his father’s was\\nthe one of which Wu Sun-fu had always most strongly disap-\\nproved. He suddenly stopped and turned to his sister again:\\n\\n“Do you propose to hide yourself away in the country for\\nthe rest of your life, then?”\\n\\n“Not necessarily. One’s ideas can always change, you know.\\nBut I think that for the moment at least the country’s a better\\nplace for me than Shanghai.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu could not help laughing, for he felt he had at last\\nfound a chink in her armour, but before he could begin his\\ncounter-attack, the blare of a motorcar horn came from the drive,\\nfollowed by a shout from Kao Sheng: “Mrs. Wu, Miss Lin and\\nthe young master are back!”\\n\\nThen came a burst of gay laughter and the click of high-heeled\\nshoes. The first one to burst into the drawing-room was Ah-\\nhsuan, brandishing a stage sword and laughing and fencing with\\nhis new toy. He was obviously not expecting to find his brother\\nSun-fu in the room, and when he turned and saw Sun-fu\\'s\\nbaleful glare on him his hand dropped to his side but he stood\\nthere grinning impudently. Wu Sun-fu frowned as he remem-\\nbered the episode of the “throwing knife” and decided that this\\nsword was just a larger replacement. So Ah-hsuan was raising\\nthe standard of rebellion against him, eh? He had stopped him\\nplaying with his silly “throwing knife,” so he had had the cheek\\nto provide himself with an even more fearsome-looking weapon!\\nWho did he think he was?\\n\\nHis wife now walked in and realizing at a glance that Sun-fu\\nwas about to fly into a rage at Ah-hsuan, she quickly put in a\\nword for him.\\n\\n“It’s all right, Sun-fu, he didn’t buy the sword himself—Hsueh-\\nshih gave it to him. You see, Hsueh-shih\\'s been taking an\\ninterest in mediaeval knights or some such thing just lately.\\nHe’s got a whole collection of swords and spears and things!”\\n\\n“Pei-yao, what about the telegram from Fei Little Beard?”\\nLin Pei-shan quickly put in to divert Wu Sun-fu’s attention.\\n“You\\'ve still got it in your handbag.”\\n\\nAh-hsuan made the most of this diversion to slip away, taking\\nhis sword with him.\\n\\nThe telegram said that a dozen or so shops in Wu Sun-fu’s\\nhome town had gone bankrupt all at the same time and that their\\nowners had gone into hiding, owing the various loca] banks a\\ntotal of more than three hundred thousand dollars. The local\\nbank owned by Wu Sun-fu was involved and now faced a crisis.\\nThe telegram ended with an appeal for money to save the situa-\\ntion. Wu Sun-fu’s face fell and he sighed. Then, without a\\nword, he walked out and went to his study to write out a reply.\\nIt read: “No money to spare. Do what you can.”\\n\\nHe was walking through a mine field! Wherever he trod\\nthere might be an explosion!—Such were the thoughts that\\ntortured Wu Sun-fu’s feverish brain as he tossed and turned\\nin his bed, unable to sleep. His authority in society and even\\nin his own home was collapsing like a house of cards! The veins\\non his temples throbbed, and the spring mattress underneath\\nhim felt like a bed of nails. His wife was groaning and moaning\\nin her sleep again as she lay beside him.\\n\\nHe heard a muffled whistle somewhere in the distance, then\\nsuddenly he saw his sister running towards him and shouting\\nthat she must go back to the country and enter a nunnery, then\\ncutting off her hair until she was completely bald. His married\\nsister Fu-fang now appeared and began accusing him of ill-\\ntreating Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan and demanding that he share\\nout the property he had inherited so that Huei-fang and Ah-\\nhsuan could set up their own homes. Suddenly, he saw Ah-\\nhsuan and a number of other people performing a sword-dance\\nin the drawing-room, while the garden swarmed with grotesque\\ngiants. Finally, he found himself in a hotel, in bed with Liu\\nYu-ying; she was flushed and giggling, and her soft white hand,\\nas hot as fire, was on his chest....\\n\\nWu Sun-fu laughed aloud in his sleep and stretched out his\\narms to embrace a soft, warm body, then heard the sound of\\nsoft, alluring laughter. All of a sudden, he opened his eyes. The\\nnet curtains over the windows were splashed with morning sun-\\nlight and shadows, and his wife was sitting on the edge of the\\nbed in a dressing-gown. She was smiling at him. He coloured\\nguiltily and quickly sat up. On a silver tray on the bedside table\\n\\na cup of hot milk was waiting for him, and beside it lay two\\nvisiting cards—Wang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-jen. A skin had just\\nbegun to form on the milk.\\n\\n*\\n\\nIn the small drawing-room, Wu Sun-fu, Wang Ho-fu and Sun\\nChi-jen were just beginning their highly important conference.\\nThey first discussed Chao Po-tao’s offer in great detail, Wu Sun-\\nfu was inclined to accept it; Wang Ho-fu was non-committal;\\nSun Chi-jen strongly opposed it. Swaying his long neck, Sun\\nChi-jen said in a cool, firm voice:\\n\\n“There are two things involved which we should consider\\nseparately. One: if we sell the company to Chao Po-tao, can we\\nrecover our capital? Two: do we need to sell it at all? I know\\nSun-fu’s probably thinking that this consortium of Chao Po-tao’s\\nis the same thing as the finance trust that all the rumours have\\nbeen about all this time, but so far as I can see it’s all a hoax!\\nIf there’s one thing Chao Po-tao can do, it’s to fabricate rumours!\\nHe’s deliberately put round this rumour of a trust to cause a\\npanic and persuade people that they must either truckle to him\\nor go bankrupt! I suggest we tell him to go to the devil!”\\n\\n“But, Chi-jen, all this talk of a trust can\\'t be just a hoax.\\nAren’t they already trying to get their hands on our company?”\\n\\n“Don’t you believe it! Even if he can start handing out loans,\\nthis finance trust of his is still nothing but a hoax! Every penny\\nChao Po-tao possesses is tied up in government bonds: he just\\nhasn’t got the resources to go into partnership with the Ameri-\\ncans! He may possibly be in league with some foreigner or other\\nto make loans on security to Chinese factory owners, but even\\nif he is he’s nothing more than a broker. If we have factories\\nto sell, there’s nothing to stop us finding a buyer ourselves!\\nThere’s no reason why we should do it through a broker!”\\n\\n“You\\'re quite right!” agreed Wang Ho-fu. “No matter how\\nformidable Chao Po-tao may appear to be, he’s only a broker in\\ndisguise! In all these joint enterprises with foreigners, the Chi-\\nnese are partners in name only: in actual fact they’re mere\\nbrokers!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu did not press his arguments, but he still seemed\\nrather ill at ease when he next spoke: “If we don’t find another\\nbuyer and have to fall back on Chao Po-tao later on, he’ll just\\n\\nplay cat-and-mouse with us. If we don’t toe the line, he\\'ll\\nreally enforce a financial blockade against us and we\\'ll be in a\\nworse jam than ever. Have you got anybody else in mind, Chi-\\njen?”\\n\\n“Not at the moment, but we\\'re pretty certain of finding\\nsomebody once we start looking. I said a moment ago that the\\nquestion falls into two parts, so shall we now go on to the\\nsecond? What it boils down to is this: as things are now, how\\nmuch longer can our company hold out?”\\n\\nHardly were the words out of Sun Chi-jen’s mouth when Wang\\nHo-fu shook his head pessimistically and Wu Sun-fu sighed and\\nbegan stroking his chin. The answer to this question could nol\\nbe more obvious: while the war dragged on indefinitely, every\\nday that the eight factories remained open they were losing\\nmoney; so the question was, in fact, not whether they could\\nkeep the factories open, but whether they wanted to. The an-\\nswer to this was that they did not, for they had long lost heart\\nover the whole project.\\n\\nThe three men looked at each other and smiled grimly. With\\nthat smile they had thrown overboard the dream they had set\\ntheir whole hearts on for the past two months and more. Feeling\\nthat a mortgage would only prolong their misery, they decided\\nunanimously to sell out completely and have done with it. Sun\\nChi-jen had two possible buyers in mind: a British firm and a\\nJapanese company.\\n\\nAfter a while Wu Sun-fu laughed mirthlessly. “‘He who\\nfights and runs away... !’ Anyway, it’s all the fault of the\\nwar, not bad management on our part!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu laughed heartily; he felt as if a heavy burden\\nhad been taken from his shoulders, and he was looking forward\\nto more restful nights from now on. Sun Chi-jen, however,\\nlooked serious and absorbed, as if he was working something\\nout. Suddenly, he slapped his thigh and looked gleefully at his\\ntwo partners.\\n\\n“The eight factories, including buildings, machinery, raw\\nmaterials and finished goods, should fetch six hundred thousand\\ndollars. That\\'s without taking into account the seventy thousand\\nin cash deposits in the company. Yes, I think we can get our\\ncapital back all right. With the factories gone, we shall have\\n\\nthe empty shell of the company left, so we\\'ll be able to carry\\non absorbing deposits and biding our time until we see an op-\\nportunity of going in again. Yun-shan said in his last telegram\\nthat he could find some share capital in Hongkong. I think we\\'d\\nbetter send him another wire and tell him to go ahead and get\\nas much as he can! Another thing, Sun-fu: we failed over the\\nfactories because of the war, but the war offers us an excellent\\nopportunity for stock-jobbing! What about shifting our capital\\nfrom factories to government bonds? It’s time we had another\\ntussle with Chao Po-tao!:\\n\\nAs he listened, Wu Sun-fu nodded his agreement. A warm\\nglow of courage spread through him once more until his finger-\\ntips quivered. They had been doing fairly well in government\\nbond speculation of late, and now, with a female spy in his\\nservice, he should be able to take the enemy by surprise. He\\ndecided to take the plunge.\\n\\n“Let’s start right away then, neck or nothing! There’s been a\\nslight rise the last few days, put that’s because the bulls have\\nbeen at work. If the war drags on like this, the three govern-\\nment lines—Tariff, Disbandment and Army Reorganization—are\\nbound to drop sooner or later, perhaps as much as thirty per\\ncent. I suggest we sell several hundred thousand today!”\\n\\n“Agreed!” said Wang Ho-fu, twirling his beard elatedly. “That’s\\njust what I was going to suggest!”\\n\\nIn the past they had managed to run factories and do stock-\\njobbing at the same time, and even so they had weathered two\\nviolent storms on the Exchange without coming to grief, so it\\nwas quite natural that they should feel supremely confident now\\nthat they were going to concentrate all their capital and energy\\non stock-jobbing alone. There was no reason whatsoever why\\nthey should not feel optimistic about their chances. Their con-\\nference came to an end in an atmosphere of excitement and\\nhope with a final enthusiastic contribution from Sun Chi-jen.\\n\\n‘Right, then: I\\'ll start looking for a buyer straight away!\\nWhether we get one or several offers, our total price is fixed at\\nfive hundred and twenty thousand dollars. They can take it or\\nleave it! The company will remain in existence, but only for\\ndeposit accounts. Ho-fu, you’d better chase up that prospect of\\nyours and get that hundred-thousand-dollar deposit. We can\\n\\ndo ‘savings,’ too. And you\\'d better keep in touch with Huang\\nFen as well, Ho-fu, for any tips he can give us. Last but not\\nleast is the job of dealing with the Stock Exchange side. I’m\\nafraid you’ll have to undertake that, Sun-fu: nobody else could\\nmanage it!”\\n\\nWhen his two partners had left, Wu Sun-fu immediately busied\\nhimself with the telephone. He first got on to his broker Lu\\nKuang-shih and then gave Han Meng-hsiang his instructions.\\nThe news from the Exchange was encouraging, and it seemed\\nthat his luck was holding, but he decided to wait until he had\\ngot a report from his spy Liu Yu-ying before finally deciding\\nhow much to sell. As he rang here, there and everywhere trying\\nto find the elusive Liu Yu-ying, he even forgot that he was\\ngetting hungry.\\n\\nAt eleven o’clock Wu Sun-fu’s car was moving slowly off down\\nthe asphalt drive towards the gate. Flushed with excitement,\\nhe was off in person to the front line in the Exchange! As they\\nneared the gate the engine stalled. The chauffeur got out and\\ncranked it up, but it just coughed and stopped again. “A bad\\nomen!” thought Wu Sun-fu, though he had always flattered\\nhimself that he was not superstitious. Irritably, he got out of\\nthe car and was just going back indoors when a horn blared out-\\nside the gate and a car came up the drive. The visitors were\\nTu Chu-chai and his wife.\\n\\nMrs. Tu had come specially to see her brother about the\\nmemorial service for their late father. She came straight to the\\npoint. “The sutra-chanting ceremony is going to be held in the\\nJade Buddha Temple tomorrow, so we\\'d better go over today and\\nhave a look at the ceremony hall.”\\n\\n“Er, yes, I know, but—look, Fu-fang, I’m afraid you\\'ll have\\nto go without me. I’m just off on some urgent business. If the\\near hadn’t broken down, I’d be gone by now.”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu frowned as he spoke, then glanced at Tu Chu-chai.\\nHe had suddenly had an idea: if only he could draw Tu Chu-chai\\ninto an alliance with him on the Exchange, he would then be\\nin a really strong position and Chao Po-tao wouldn\\'t stand a\\nchance! But how could he best go about it? Wu Sun-fu im-\\nmediately began racking his brains.\\n\\n“All right,” said Fu-fang. “I can go along with Pei-yao. But\\nyou’d better be there at nine o’clock tomorrow morning to burn\\nthe incense when they start! And Pei-yao, Huei-fang and Ah-\\nhsuan will have to be there, too!”\\n\\n“Ah! Speaking of Huei-fang,” said Wu Sun-fu, ‘she wants\\nto go back to the country of all places! I just can’t make her\\nsee sense!” He had missed the first part of what Mrs. Tu had\\nsaid, but the mention of Huei-fang’s name had registered and\\nreminded him of this particular worry of his.\\n\\nMrs. Tu did not seem in the least surprised, and said in quite\\na matter-of-fact tone of voice, “Oh, young people are always\\nlike that—they like to be on the move all the time. You get\\nfed up with Shanghai in no time at all and you soon want to go\\ndown to the country for a little holiday!”\\n\\n“It’s more than a little holiday that she wants! I thought you\\nmight have a word with her, Fu-fang. Perhaps she’ll listen to\\nyou. It beats me. I can’t make out what’s got into her. Any-\\nway, you\\'ll find out all about it when you see her. It might\\nbe some form of neurosis.”\\n\\nHaving got Mrs. Tu out of the way, Wu Sun-fu now turned\\nto Tu Chu-chai and began his negotiations for an alliance. He\\ntalked glibly about the war dragging on for a long time yet and\\npressed the point that, since the money raised on government\\nbonds was all going to military expenses, the bonds were bound\\nto drop: what a wonderful chance for the bears! He did not\\nopenly suggest that Tu Chu-chai should join forces with him,\\nbut just did his best to impress on him the advantage of selling\\nshort. All he wanted was that Tu Chu-chai should do the same\\nas he was doing.\\n\\nAs he listened, Tu Chu-chai calmly took snuff and nodded, a\\nfaint smile on his lips.\\nXVHI\\n\\nHUEI-FANG had shut herself in her own room for the last two\\ndays. She had taken this step as a final protest against Wu\\nSun-fu’s refusal to let her go back home to the country after the\\nmemorial service for her late father. No one had been able to\\npersuade her to leave her room, so they left her to her own\\ndevices.\\n\\nThe Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments, which her\\nfather had left her, was now her “talisman.” She had rummaged\\nout from the luggage the old man had brought with him to\\nShanghai two months before an ancient incense-burner and\\nseveral bundles of high-quality incense. Her father had always\\nconsidered these accessories essential for the ritual reading of\\nthe Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments. She had now\\nbegun to say her prayers three times a day—morning, afternoon\\nand evening—and each time she burned incense. Having failed\\nto find her father’s prayer-cushion, she had no alternative but\\nto make do with sitting on a sofa with her legs tucked under her.\\n\\nAfter careful consideration she had decided to embrace her\\nfather’s religious teachings. This did not mean that she wished\\nto “lay up treasure in Heaven,” but she hoped that her religious\\nexercises would enable her to “cleanse her heart” and “subdue\\ndesire,” and so help to alleviate her mental anguish. Her first\\nday had been quite successful. As she sat there intoning the\\nverses of the book with the blue smoke from the incense curling\\nround her, she could imagine herself back in the study of her\\nold home. Her father’s pious -face floated before her, and she\\nwas so overcome that her eyes filled with tears. Sweet memories\\ncame flooding back, vivid to the minutest detail, of the simple,\\npeaceful life she had led when she had looked after her aged\\nfather in their old home; and she derived from these memories\\n\\na peace of mind she had never known before. A contented smile\\nplayed round her lips and the sacred verses lay unread before\\nher. Lulled by the fragrance of the incense, she sank limply\\nagainst the back of the sofa and fell into a trance, no longer\\nthinking or conscious of anything. And so she remained until\\nat long last the incense had burnt out; then she sighed as if she\\nhad woken up again, and smiled faintly.\\n\\nIt was in this fashion, lost in dreams and memories, that Huei-\\nfang passed her first day of prayer and meditation, unconscious\\neven of the pangs of hunger.\\n\\nBut by the afternoon of the second day the scriptures and the\\nincense began to lose their mysterious power. Her memories\\ncame back as they had the day before, but today she did not\\nrelish them so much, and began to feel about them the way one\\nfeels about an old friend whom one meets after a long absence,\\nwho is welcome on the first day but whose company begins to\\npall on the second. Though she dutifully continued to chant\\nthe scriptures over and over again and meditate with her eyes\\nfixed on the tip of her nose and her nose pointing at her heart,\\nnevertheless all sorts of noises forced their way into her unwill-\\ning ears and distracted her attention: a car hooting in the street\\noutside, a man’s heavy footsteps going past her door, the distant\\ntinkling of the piano in the drawing-room downstairs, the sound\\nof men and women talking and laughing happily together. By\\nthe time the first stick of incense had burnt down, the sofa\\nbegan to feel prickly and the air seemed so close that she thought\\nshe would suffocate. She struggled with a desire to go out and\\nhave a look round, though what it was she wanted to look at\\nshe did not know. Eventually she seemed to settle down again.\\nShe picked up the book written in her father’s pious hand and\\nstared at it with drooping head. She sighed over and over again,\\nand her eyes became moist.\\n\\nThat night, it was a long time before she could get to sleep,\\nand when she finally did drop off she was troubled by dreams,\\nthe sort of wild dreams which had often disturbed her rest be-\\nfore, and from which she always woke sobbing and crying. Now\\nthey came back again, one after the other, till she tossed and\\nturned in a semi-conscious daze. Several times during that short\\nsummer night she started up from her sleep in terror.\\n\\nWhen she got up next morning her face was pale and drawn,\\nher finger-tips icy cold, and her heart weak and trembling. The\\nverses of the Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments\\nseemed to mock at her as she read, and several times she closed\\nit and sighed.\\n\\nThe afternoon was hot and close, and Huei-fang felt as un-\\ncomfortable as an earthworm on a hot brick. She lit a stick\\nof incense and picked up the book for her afternoon prayers\\nbut her ears rang with noises from the house, from the garden,\\nand from the distant street. Her mind seemed to be analysing\\nand interpreting every little sound. Every time footsteps went\\npast the door her ears pricked up and her heart beat faster. She\\nsat with tears in her eyes, hoping desperately that the footsteps\\nwould stop at her door, hoping desperately to hear a tap on the\\ndoor, so that she might run across and open it to her brother,\\nher sister-in-law—or even Pei-shan, coming to persuade her\\nto go out with them!\\n\\nBut every time she was disappointed. Every time the foot-\\nsteps went straight past the door and never came back again.\\nShe had been forgotten, cast aside like an old-fashioned dress!\\nAs she sat there with the blue smoke of the incense curling\\nround her and the book in her hands, she began to feel resent-\\nful towards her brother, her sister-in-law, even towards Lin Pei-\\nshan, who was always as happy as a lark. She felt that every-\\nbody was free and happy except her, and she was forgotten, de-\\nprived of her freedom and happiness! She felt that her present\\nseclusion was not of her own free will: they had forced her\\nto it. They were plotting against her and using this subtle meth-\\nod to deprive her of her human rights!\\n\\nShe remembered a tragic story she had heard when she had\\nbeen living at her old home: a young lady “of good family” like\\nherself had been locked up indoors by her parents for “unseemly\\nbehaviour,” and the story was put around that she had gone\\ninto voluntary seclusion for “meditation?’ The girl had even-\\ntually hanged herself. “Isn’t that exactly what’s happening to\\nme?” She felt a thrill of horror as she thought of it. Suddenly,\\nshe remembered a dream she had had the night before, a dream\\nwhich she had had several times and which had become so\\nfamiliar to her by now that she almost accepted it as Teality.\\n\\nThe dream seemed to refer to one evening about three weeks\\nago. She was alone with Fan Po-wen in the hexagonal pavilion\\non the artificial hill on the other side of the pond in the garden.\\nA storm was gathering in the sky. They chatted together for\\na while and afterwards she lost her virginity in the darkness\\nof the pavilion. Of all the wild dreams that came to haunt her,\\none always stood out from the rest and seemed quite real to her,\\nand that was the dream which takes place in the pavilion on that\\nstormy night. As the rain roars on the roof of the pavilion she\\nlies languidly back in an easy-chair with Fan Po-wen sitting\\nopposite. As she sits there with her eyes closed, she hears him\\ncome across to her. Suddenly, she goes limp all over, intoxicated\\nand unresisting.\\n\\nShe suddenly screamed, and the book fell to the floor. She\\nautomatically bent to pick it up and looked nervously all round.\\nThere was a strained smile on her lips and two tear-drops\\nglistened on her lashes. She was firmly convinced that this\\nromantic dream had actually happened and that it was for this\\nmisbehaviour that they were confining her to her room, while\\ntelling the world outside that it was “voluntary seclusion!” It\\nseemed there was only one way out for her as there had been\\nfor the other girl—suicide by swallowing a piece of gold or hang-\\ning herself!\\n\\nShe even persuaded herself that, even if she herself did not\\nwish to end her life like this, her tyrant of a brother would\\nsooner or later come in and force her to do so. Her heart pounded\\nmadly at the thought and her finger-tips felt icy, but her face\\nwas burning. She asked herself through clenched teeth: “Why\\nshould I have all the bad luck? Why should I be treated dif-\\nferently from everybody else? Why shvuld the other girls be\\nallowed to go out with boys just as they like? Why should they\\npretend not to notice the way Pei-shan goes on? Why should\\nI give in and let them treat me like this? But what can I do\\nabout it? There must be another way out!” She stood up ab-\\nruptly, her whole being ablaze with the fire of rebellion. But\\nthe next moment she flopped down on the sofa again. She was\\nalone in the world, with no one to go to for advice, no one to\\nhelp her!\\n\\nSuddenly, hurried footsteps pattered along to the door of her\\nroom and stopped. There was a sharp rap on the door. She\\nwas convinced that it was her brother coming to force her to\\ntake her own life. With a despairing sigh she threw herself\\non the bed and buried her face in the pillow, her blood freezing\\nin her veins.\\n\\n“Huei-fang! Are you asleep?” came a girl\\'s shrill voice in\\nher ear. Huei-fang jerked round in surprise to find her vivacious\\ncousin Chang Su-su standing by the side of the bed. She must\\nbe dreaming again! She rubbed her eyes and looked again, then\\nsuddenly sprang up, grasped Chang Su-su’s hand, and burst into\\ntears. Ata time like this she would have welcomed any visitor\\nat all with open arms—even a cat or a dog!\\n\\nChang Su-su was too surprised to do anything but laugh. She\\nsat down on the edge of the bed, shook Huei-fang by the shoulder,\\nand asked impatiently, “Why, what’s the matter with you, Huei-\\nfang? Why do you burst into tears the moment you see me?\\nAre you ill or something? Why don’t you say something?”\\n\\n“It’s all right, there’s nothing the matter with me,” said Huei-\\nfang, shaking her head and forcing back her tears. She felt a\\nlittle better now that she knew she was not dreaming and that\\nit really was Chang Su-su who had come to see her.\\n\\n“I really can’t understand you, Huei-fang! When everybody\\ngoes out you stay here indoors all alone! Why don’t you go out\\nand have a good time?”\\n\\n“T can’t—”\\n\\nShe stopped short and heaved a sigh, then squeezed Chang\\nSu-su’s hand as if to express what she had left unsaid.\\n\\nChang Su-su frowned and looked attentively at Huei-fang’s\\nface, but said nothing. Whatever they said, she could see no\\nsigns of a “neurosis.” Why, then, should she shut herself up\\nin her room like this and refuse to come out? And why this\\nunconvincing attempt at being a nun or a Taoist or whatever\\nit was? The whole thing made Chang Su-su feel rather annoyed.\\nShe suddenly recalled how, on the day of Old Mr. Wu\\'s death,\\nshe, Fan Po-wen, Wu Chih-sheng and the others had made bets\\nabout Huei-fang; she said with a trace of sadness in her voice:\\n\\n“Huei-fang, some time ago we made a bet about you—that’s\\nto say Wu Chih-sheng, Fan Po-wen and Pei-shan—oh, yes, and\\n\\nTu Hsin-to was there, too. The bet was about whether you\\nwould change after you’d lived in Shanghai for a while. Though\\nnone of us ever expected that you would change like this!”\\n\\n“Did you expect me to change, then? Well, in what way did\\nyou think I’d change, Su-su?”\\n\\n“J don’t remember now, but whatever it was we all thought\\nyou would change. But now—I don’t know—it seems so odd:\\nyou’ve changed, and yet you haven’t, somehow!”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve noticed it myself. I’m not the same girl that I was\\nwhen I lived in the country!”\\n\\n“Oh, but you are, Huei-fang! There was a time when you\\nseemed to be changing, but now you\\'re back in the same old rut\\nagain!”\\n\\nChang Su-su\\'s voice was impatient as she said this. She was\\nnow more convinced than ever that Huei-fang was far from\\nbeing neurotic and that Wu Sun-fu and the others were exag-\\ngerating.\\n\\n“Back in the same old rut, did you say? But when I was\\nwith father in the country I wasn’t the same as I am now. I\\ndon\\'t think anybody can understand why I’m so unhappy, Su-su!\\nAnd nobody wants to understand, either!”\\n\\nHuei-fang’s voice was steady, and her eyes were suddenly\\nbright with determination. It was the first time Chang Su-su\\nhad seen this steely glint in her eyes, and it rather surprised\\nher. But the next instant her eyes became dull and troubled\\nonce again. She sat staring into space and muttered:\\n\\n“So you bet on me, did you? And Fan Po-wen was in it, too.\\nWhat—what did he say about it? Do tell me, Su-su—oh, what\\'s\\nthe point? Forget it. Let’s talk about something else.”\\n\\nChang Su-su suddenly laughed, then jumped up, threw her\\narm round Huei-fang’s neck and said excitedly in her ear:\\n\\n“Why shouldn’t you ask me about Fan Po-wen? Why\\nshouldn’t we talk about him? I know all about it, Huei-fang;\\nI\\'ve known all along that you’ve got your eye cn him! But why\\nbe so shy and backward about it? Sun-fu interferes, isn’t that\\nit? I’ve known all along about that, too. He’s got no right to\\ninterfere in your private affairs! You\\'re free to do what you\\nlike!’\\n\\nHuei-fang immediately crimsoned. Chang Su-su’s frank words\\nhad struck home. She had brought into the open all the things\\nthat had been preying on Huei-fang’s mind—all the things she\\nhad not dared mention. She grasped Su-su’s hand and squeezed\\nit and tears of gratitude welled up in her eyes. But Chang Su-su\\nsuddenly pulled her hand away and drew herself up, then fixed\\nher keen eyes on Huei-fang and said earnestly:\\n\\n“I suppose all this shutting yourself in your room and chant-\\ning from this Book of Rewards and Punishments here is your\\nway of protesting against Sun-fu’s dictatorship, then? You’re\\ngoing about it the wrong way! You\\'ve got the will to fight, all\\nright, but your method’s all wrong! And another thing: I must\\nwarn you that Po-wen is a spineless young man who doesn’t dare\\nstand up for himself! He was in love with Pei-shan once, and\\nthey used to spend all their time together; but the moment Sun-\\nfu objected, he backed out! I tell you, Huei-fang, if you’re going\\nto resist Sun-fu’s interference and fight for your freedom, it’s\\nno good pinning your hopes on a spineless weakling!”\\n\\nAs she said this, Chang Su-su laughed and brought both her\\nhands down sharply on Huei-fang’s shoulders. Huei-fang was\\nnot expecting this and almost toppled off, but she had to laugh.\\nThen, as her smile faded, her expression became quite serious\\nagain and she searched Chang Su-su’s face, She was trying to\\npluck up courage to make further inquiries about the “spineless”\\nFan Po-wen, but she was afraid her cousin might laugh at her\\nif she pursued the matter any further. She now looked up to\\nSu-su as her champion, and she did not want to appear too silly\\nin her champion’s eyes. After a great struggle, she finally de-\\ncided to try and tell Su-su what was on her mind.\\n\\n“I think you understand what’s the matter with me, Su-su.\\nI’ve always been so used to hiding my feelings that I can’t bring\\nmyself to be frank about them when I want to. I’ve no one to\\nconfide in and no one to advise me! I just can’t think straight\\nand I don’t know what to do. I’m fed up with the miserable\\nlife here and all I want to do is to go back home to the country.\\nWhen they refused to let me go, I made up my mind to shut\\nmyself up in my room and have nothing more to do with them!\\nI’ve been here two days now, but I’m more miserable than\\n\\never! I know I’m going about it the wrong way, Su-su, but\\nwhat is there I can do?”\\n\\nChang Su-su’s reply was a long, hilarious roar of laughter.\\nWith a swing of her hips she moved up close to Huei-fang, held\\nher face between her hands, and looked at it closely. It was a\\nhot, flushed face with pale, trembling lips. After a moment\\nChang Su-su said sternly, “It’s up to you, Huei-fang. You must\\npluck up courage and have it out with Sun-fu once and for all!\\nAnother thing: you ought to go to school. You must insist that\\nSun-fu sends you to school next term!”\\n\\nHuei-fang’s only reply was an emphatic shake of her head.\\nChang Su-su’s eyes opened wide in astonishment and her fore-\\nhead wrinkled.\\n\\n“Don’t you want to go to school, then\\n\\n“Yes, but I don\\'t think any school would have me. I’ve read\\nshelves and shelves of ancient Chinese classics, but 1 don’t know\\na thing about all these modern subjects.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t matter: you can easily catch up on your own.\\nNow Huei-fang, the longer you stay cooped up in here the more\\ndepressed you\\'ll get! Come out for a walk with me!”\\n\\nAs she said this, Chang Su-su dragged her off the bed, then\\ntold her to hurry up and have a wash and get herself ready\\nto go out. As she stood bathing her face over the wash basin,\\nHuei-fang smiled to herself and shed a few furtive tears. They\\nwere tears of joy, and also tears of determination! Although\\nshe had not yet any clear idea what exactly she was going to,\\nshe was nevertheless determined to do whatever Chang Su-su\\ntold her!\\n\\non\\n\\n*\\n\\nChang Su-su had hired a car and was now taking Huei-fang\\nout for a breath of fresh air. It was past three o’clock and the\\nsun was at its hottest. Huei-fang sat back in the car with her\\neyes closed, feeling slightly dizzy. Her mood of anxiety was\\ngradually returning again. Her future was, after all, still as\\nmuch a riddle as ever. She hoped this riddle would soon be\\nsolved, but at the same time she was afraid. The car had left\\nthe city and was now bumping over a none too smooth road on\\nthe outskirts, churning up a swirl of hot, choking yellow dust\\nas it sped along. On either side of the road stretched vividly\\n\\ngreen fields, dotted here and there with grave-mounds. Suddenly,\\nthe car jolted violently and Huei-fang opened her eyes with a\\nstart. When she saw they were in the country she thought that\\nshe was dreaming again. She pulled herself together and nudged\\nChang Su-su:\\n\\n“Look! We’re going the wrong way, aren’t we?” ;\\n\\nChang Su-su smiled but made no reply, for she was at this\\nmoment engrossed in her own day-dreaming. She was a sen-\\nsitive, warm-hearted girl, and it made her happy to think that\\nshe had succeeded in luring Huei-fang out of her room. Just\\nnow she was busying herself with plans for Huei-fang’s future,\\na beautiful, exciting future as free as the sea and the sky, a\\nfuture with boundless possibilities.\\n\\nHuei-fang took Chang Su-su’s silence as an assurance that\\nthey had not lost their way and that they really were going\\nout into the country. She was glad. As she turned her whole\\nattention to enjoying the green fields which swirled past them\\nshe could imagine for a moment that she was back home. In\\nfact, the only difference between this stretch of country place\\nand her own was the presence of the cars which raced past\\nthem with their clouds of yellow dust. Suddenly, Huei-fang\\ngasped in amazement and nudged Chang Su-su once more. The\\ncar was slowing down and ahead of them was a row of cars of\\nall shapes and colours parked in the shade of a grove of willow-\\ntrees. Walking away from the cars were a number of women,\\ntheir heads on their escorts’ shoulders. Their lips were scarlet,\\ntheir eyebrows pencilled, and their arms white and bare. So\\nthey were still in Shanghai!\\n\\nAs Huei-fang followed Chang Su-su out of the car and into a\\nstrange-looking garden, her amazement gradually increased until\\nher head span. It was an ordinary country scene, with trees\\nand the churring of cicadas, but it was still obviously Shanghai\\nwith its fashionably-dressed men and women behaving as always\\nin a way she was afraid to look at and yet which she envied.\\nEverywhere she turned she saw something which took her breath\\naway and made her blush uncomfortably. In the shade of a\\nnearby tree a man and a woman were lying on the grass, talk-\\ning and laughing together, while one of the woman’s bare legs\\nwas propped up high across the other, her high-heeled shoe point-\\n\\ning straight at the sky. A little farther away she saw a couple\\nso close together that they seemed to be one person with two\\nbacks! Huei-fang quickly shut her eyes. Her heart was thump-\\ning so hard that she could hardly bear it.\\n\\nThen she caught sight of some familiar faces at a table beneath\\na large sun-shade. There were three of them. She felt like\\nturning and running away, but Chang Su-su held her back.\\n\\n“Well I\\'ll be—look! The hermit’s left her cell! This deserves\\nto be writ large on the pages of history!”\\n\\nThis came from a young man under the sun-shade. As he\\nsprang to his feet he all but overturned the little table cluttered\\nup with beer bottles, lemonade bottles and plates of food. Huei-\\nfang blushed crimson, for the young man was none other than\\nFan Po-wen. Suddenly her shameless dream came back to her\\nand her face changed from crimson to a deathly white. She\\nwanted to run away but her feet seemed rooted to the ground.\\nWith a supreme effort she managed to turn and say hello to Wu\\nChih-sheng.\\n\\n“Tf jt’s such an historic event, Po-wen, you’d better write a\\npoem to commemorate it! The subject is—”\\n\\n“But he can’t!” chaffed Wu Chih-sheng before Li Yu-ting could\\nset a subject. ‘Poverty may make other poets more imaginative,\\nbut it leaves Po-wen without an idea in his head! How do you\\nimagine he could write poetry in his present state!”\\n\\nBut Fan Po-wen was unperturbed. He just shook his head\\nand said, “Can’t be helped! Even the Muse of Poetry has to\\nfollow Mammon around! I’ve no choice in the matter!”\\n\\nEverybody laughed and even Huei-fang joined in, though\\nChang Su-su merely parted her lips in a mechanical smile, then\\ninquired with a puzzled frown, “What are you three doing con-\\ngregating here, anyway?”\\n\\n“We might well ask you and Huei-fang the same thing!” parried\\nWu Chih-sheng. He had spent a lot of time with Fan Po-wen just\\nlately, and was acquiring the poet’s fondness for repartee.\\n\\n“Us? We\\'ve come out for a breath of fresh air. I’m taking\\nHuei-fang round to see what the modern youth of Shanghai gets\\nup to when it goes out into the country!”\\n\\n“Well, as a matter of fact, we\\'re here for much the same\\nreason. Professor Li here believes we’re in for an Armageddon\\n\\nany moment now, and it’s ruined his appetite. He\\'s afraid we\\'ll\\nall be murdered in our beds before we know where we are. So\\nwe\\'ve brought him along today to see how even these émigré\\nRussian aristocrats and bourgeois can still scrape a living!\"\\n\\n“I say, Chih-sheng!” protested Li Yu-ting hastily, scratching\\nhis head without realizing that he was doing it. “You don’t\\nhave to keep joking about serious matters!” Chang Su-su looked\\non and listened, amused and annoyed at the same time. She\\ntook hold of Huei-fang’s hand and was just going to walk away\\nwhen Fan Po-wen suddenly sprang up and exclaimed grimly:\\n\\n“Did you hear that? Professor Li always takes everything\\nseriously and he’s always preparing for the worst. He’s got the\\nright idea! Just look at that White Russian émigré over there\\n—probably a marquis or an earl or something once! All his\\nlife he’s had servants to bring him his wine and open his bottles\\nfor him, but look at him now: it’s now his turn to wait on other\\npeople! But he’s picked up his new trade pretty quickly—look,\\nhe can even hold six lemonade bottles in one hand!”\\n\\n“Ah, but when our turn comes, we probably won’t even have\\nthe little luck that they’ve got!” said Li Yu-ting suddenly in\\nsuch a mournful voice that Wu Chih-sheng and the others burst\\nout laughing again.\\n\\n“Just listen to the Three Wise Men! They bore me to tears!”\\njeered Chang Su-su. She turned and left them, taking Huei-\\nfang with her. They went and sat at a little table under the\\ntrees by the river and ordered lemonade. It was quiet here, and\\nthey had a view of the river. The water sparkled in the blazing\\nsunlight, and there was not a boat in sight. Huei-fang felt\\nmore at ease now, but one thing still puzzled her: why should\\npeople come all the way here from the city just to drink lemonade\\nand talk and flirt? It wasn’t as if it was a beauty spot! Yet at\\nthe same time she had to admit that the gaily-dressed people\\nwho came here did help to liven the place up and give it a touch\\nof colour.\\n\\nChang Su-su appeared to be upset and sat in moody silence.\\nAfter a while she muttered to herself: “Decadent lot!— Still,\\nit’s not to be wondered at, really!”\\n\\nShe broke into a hysterical laugh and took a sip at her lem-\\nonade, then stretched and patted Huei-fang on the shoulder.\\n\\n“What will you do if Sun-fu absolutely refuses to let you go\\nto school?”\\n\\n“What would you suggest?”\\n\\n“Take him to court!”\\n\\n“What!” gasped Huei-fang, a flush of colour coming to her\\ncheeks. She stared dubiously at Chang Su-su as much as to\\nsay, “You\\'re joking!” Chang Su-su flashed her a look, then\\ntilted her head back and smiled. She had managed to instil a\\nlittle courage into the girl, and now her protégée was wavering\\nagain. Huei-fang now went on:\\n\\n“You\\'re overdoing it, Su-su. It could never come to that! I\\ncan always get Fu-fang to put in a word for me with Sun-fu.”\\n\\n“Sg much the better—I was only suggesting legal action as\\na last resort.”\\n\\n“But Su-su, I don’t want to go back to that house again! I\\ncouldn’t bear to live there another day!”\\n\\n“Eh?—”\\n\\nIt was now Chang Su-su’s turn to be surprised. She just could\\nnot keep pace with the devious workings of Huei-fang’s mird.\\nHuei-fang’s face was flushed again. She looked nervously all\\nround, then gazed appealingly at Chang Su-su. After a moment\\nher head drooped despairingly and she murmured, “You don’t\\nknow how lonely I am in that house!”\\n\\n“what do you mean, ‘lonely’?”\\n\\n“They’ve all got friends but me! And I always feel so lost.\\nIf I live there any longer I\\'ll go mad!”\\n\\nChang Su-su burst out laughing. She had finally found out\\nwhy Huei-fang was so miserable. “Mostly sexual frustration!”\\nshe thought to herself. She glanced at Huei-fang and laughed\\nagain despite herself. It came as a disappointment to her to\\nrealize that she had overestimated Huei-fang’s will to fight, yet\\nshe could not help feeling sorry for her when she saw her miser-\\nable expression. She thought hard for a moment, unable to de-\\ncide what to do with this poor, inexperienced girl, but before she\\nmade up her mind, Huei-fang said quite firmly, “I don’t want to\\nlive in that house a day longer! Not a single day! I want to\\nlive with you, Su-su, and have you teach me what to do!”\\n\\nBeing a warm-hearted girl, Chang Su-su could not find it in\\nher to disregard this desperate cry for help. Although she had a\\n\\n“friend” herself, which would mean that Huei-fang would still\\nbe as lonely as ever even if she came to live with her, Chang\\nSu-su had not the courage to explain this to Huei-fang and so\\ndash ali her hopes to the ground.\\n\\nThe sun had disappeared behind a cloud and a cool, refreshing\\nbreeze had sprung up. Thinking that her main problem had now\\nbeen solved, Huei-fang began to dream of her free and happy\\nfuture. She did not really know much about Chang Su-su, ex-\\ncept that she was an undergraduate who was spending her sum-\\nmer vacation at a Y.W.C.A. hostel, yet she was prepared to adopt\\nthis cousin of hers as a kind of foster-mother.\\n\\nSuddenly, the sound of someone singing came across the water\\non the wind. The accent was that of Huei-fang’s home town and\\nthe voice seemed familiar to her. She smiled absently at Chang\\nSu-su. As the voice came nearer and nearer, Huei-fang began\\nto catch the words:\\n\\nHeav’n and earth are a mighty forge\\nWhere hidden forces flame,\\n\\nAnd all things in the Universe\\nFrom Nature’s anvil came.\\n\\nShe recognized this as a verse from the ancient poem Ode to\\nthe Roc and the voice as Tu Hsin-to’s. She could not help\\nlaughing. She thought what a pleasant young man he was, and\\nher thoughts went immediately from him to Lin Pei-shan. By\\nnow, Chang Su-su had also recognized the singer. She smiled,\\nthen suddenly got up and crept down to the bank of the river,\\nwhere she crouched down under a tree. Huei-fang stopped laugh-\\ning and followed Chang Su-su’s example.\\n\\nA skiff came slowly round the bend, keeping close under the\\nnearer bank. Tu Hsin-to was rowing, and with him was a girl\\nin a brown straw hat with yellow ribbons that fluttered in the\\nbreeze. Huei-fang recognized the hat—it was Lin Pei-shan’s.\\nThe boat came nearer, and when it was about three or four yards\\naway Chang Su-su picked up a clod of carth and threw it at\\nthe boat.\\n\\n“Oh!”\\n\\nIt was Lin Pei-shan’s voice, all right! The hat moved round,\\nand the boat stopped at once. Then Chang Su-su sprang up and\\n\\nlaughed. “Having a good time, you selfish creatures? No won-\\nder some people are lonely!”\\n\\nTu Hsin-to and Lin Pei-shan turned round together and saw\\nChang Su-su standing there, but Huei-fang had not yet shown\\nherself, There was more laughter as the oars splashed again and\\nthe boat pulled in to the bank. As she crouched behind the tree,\\nHuei-fang heard the silvery voice of Lin Pei-shan:\\n\\n“Su-su, you little revolutionary! I thought you were too busy\\nwith ‘things that matter’ to come down here! We didn’t ask\\nyou to join us because we were afraid of being called decadent\\nand corrupt!”\\n\\n“But that was a beautiful bit of grenade-throwing, Miss Chang!\\nQualified revolutionary!”\\n\\n“Now guess who I\\'ve got here with me! If you guess wrong,\\nyou\\'ll have to give me Pei-shan as a forfeit!”\\n\\n“Might be any old Tom, Dick or Harry!” taunted Lin Pei-shan.\\nHuei-fang began to feel rather shy of showing her face now. She\\nheard a rustle as the boat scraped up against the undergrowth\\nthat overhung the water\\'s edge, then, without warning, Chang\\nSu-su ran laughing round the tree and pulled her out of her\\nhiding-place so that the couple in the boat could see her. She\\nblushed awkwardly and said:\\n\\n“Hullo, Pei-shan! I suppose you often come here? Though\\nthe place doesn’t seem all that wonderful, really!”\\n\\n“Why, Huei-fang! You\\'re the last person I expected to find\\nhere!—Congratulations, Su-su! The ruthless revolutionary at\\nwork! Nobody else can talk her round, but you succeed in get-\\nting her out to a place like this!”\\n\\nThe three girls now began talking and laughing all at the\\nsame time. Tu Hsin-to anchored the boat by sticking an oar in\\nthe mud and sat there in silence, a smile on his lips. So far as\\nhe was concerned, all these ups and downs were just part of the\\nnatural course of things and did not really interest him. When\\nHuei-fang had been unable to get what she wanted, she had\\nquite naturally taken refuge in her Book of Rewards and Pun-\\nishments; it seemed to him just as natural that she should now\\nthrow the book aside and come down to the gay Rio Rita Plea-\\nsure Garden.\\n\\nSuddenly, there was a rumble of thunder and flying black\\nclouds began gathering overhead until the sky was blotted out.\\n\\n“It’s going to rain!” said Chang Su-su, looking up at the sky.\\nShe grasped Huei-fang’s arm. “We\\'d better be getting back,\\nHuei-fang.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry! It\\'ll only be a shower. Come on, come for a\\nrow with us.”\\n\\n“Not now. Though if you want to get a party together, Fan\\nPo-wen and the others are just over there! I\\'ll run over and\\nfetch them if you like!”\\n\\nWith this parting shot at Lin Pei-shan, Chang Su-su went off\\ninto a peal of laughter, then made off with Huei-fang.\\n\\nTu Hsin-to gazed after the two girls with his usual blasé smile\\non his lips, then shoved off by pushing his oar against a tree-root\\non the bank. As the boat swung slowly round, Lin Pei-shan’s\\ndress began flapping in the strong breeze that had sprung up.\\nShe sat with bent head, watching the trees reflected in the water\\nand twisting the hem of her dress round her fingers. After a\\nwhile she looked up into Tu Hsin-to’s face with a look in her\\neyes which seemed to say, “We can’t go on like this!’ But Tu\\nHsin-to still smiled.\\n\\nThe boat was now passing through a sort of tunnel formed by\\noverhanging willows and reeds brushed rustling past its sides.\\nLin Pei-shan sighed, then edged forward and pillowed her head\\non Tu Hsin-to’s knees, He at once shipped his oars and let the\\nboat drift. Lin Pei-shan shifted her legs and laughed.\\n\\n“The fact remains, you must find a way out!” she murmured\\nhesitantly. “... If only we could get Sun-fu to agree, every-\\nthing would be all right.” She fixed her limpid eyes on him for\\na moment. “Oh, why don’t you say something? Didn’t you hear\\nwhat I said? I said all we want is to get Sun-fu to agree! We\\nmust think of a way out—”\\n\\n“IT know Sun-fu: he just won’t hear of it!’\\n\\n“What are we going to do, then?”\\n\\n“Oh, carry on as long as we can!”\\n\\n“Hm! And how long will that be, pray?”\\n\\n“Until we can’t go on any longer—until you\\'ve got a legal hus-\\nband!”\\n\\n“Well! Of all the cheek!”\\n\\n“Now look, Pei-shan, if you\\'ll just think about it for a moment\\nyou\\'ll see that I’m right. You may as well ask for the moon as\\nexpect Sun-fu to agree. Unless we elope, they’ll marry you off\\nsooner or later to somebody else. But you don’t want all the\\nhardship that would follow an elopement, and I’m not so keen\\non the idea myself, either.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s a fine thing to say! One would think there had\\nnever been anything between us!”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, we\\'ve had our moments! I’m not forgetting that.\\nBut what of it? You’re still the same girl—you haven\\'t lost any-\\nthing! Your lips are just as red, your arms are just as soft and\\nsmooth, your eyes are just as eloquent as ever they were! Your\\nyouth and beauty are intact. You\\'ll make your future husband\\nhappy, and you\\'ll be happy yourself. Isn’t that right?”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan broke into a laugh. She could find nothing wrong\\nwith what Tu Hsin-to had said, for she was still at an age where\\nher heart had not yet awoken to the meaning of true love. She\\nwas still a child, and life for her was nothing more than one\\nlong game. A trailing willow twig brushed against her face,\\nand she stretched out her hand and snapped it off. She put the\\nend in her mouth and bit off a shred, then spat it out and laughed.\\n\\n“And who’s going to be my legal husband?”\\n\\n“~ don’t know yet. Fan Po-wen, I shouldn’t wonder!”\\n\\n“But they want me to marry off to your uncle Hsueh-shih!”\\n\\n“Very poor taste! Hsueh-shih’s a first-class dolt. No good to\\nyou for a husband! But never mind: life’s only a game!”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan laughed and scooped up a handful of water and\\nsplashed it in Tu Hsin-to’s face with a look of pretended an-\\nnoyance, but made no comment. The boat now came to the end\\nof the tunnel of willows and out into a narrower stretch of the\\nriver. Tu Hsin-to laughed carelessly and took up the oars again.\\nWith much splashing and gurgling the boat slowly turned round\\nagain.\\n\\n*\\n\\nIt was about five o’clock when the rain came, driving in from\\nthe east. In Wu Sun-fu’s house the servants rushed to close all\\nthe windows on the east side of the house, but they forgot about\\nHuei-fang’s room. Driven by the easterly gale, the rain pelted\\ninto the room through the open window and drenched her precious\\n\\nBook of Rewards and Punishments, which was lying open on a\\ntable just inside, so that the vermilion lines between the columns\\nof characters in the text began to run and spread. The incense-\\nburner became full and the water overflowed and flooded the\\ntable, reducing the expensive bundle of incense to a thin yellow\\npulp, which gradually spread on to the book.\\n\\nThe rain sent everyone scurrying back home. Mrs. Wu was\\nthe first one back. Feeling chilly in her damp clothes, she went\\nstraight upstairs to change. Then Lin Pei-shan came in, alone.\\nInstead of going to change her wet clothes, she ran upstairs and\\nburst into Huei-fang’s room.\\n\\nShe stopped in surprise when she saw how the driving rain was\\nplaying havoc with the room. She stood gaping for a moment,\\nthen turned and ran along to her sister’s room. She shot in\\nthrough the door, then stood there laughing till her sides ached,\\nunable to get a word out.\\n\\nBeing quite accustomed to her sister’s foolish antics, Mrs. Wu\\nshowed no signs of surprise, but continued to sit there holding\\na cup of tea, lost in her own thoughts.\\n\\nThe room was gloomy and the rain was pelting noisily against\\nthe window. They heard Wu Sun-fu’s car pull up outside the\\nfront door. When she had recovered from her fit of laughing, Lin\\nPei-shan went slowly across to Mrs. Wu and said in a low voice,\\n“Have you heard the news, Pei-yao? Do you know where Huei-\\nfang’s gone?”\\n\\nMrs. Wu Sun-fu seemed startled for a second, but immediately\\nsmiled, thinking that her sister was playing a joke on her.\\n\\n“l’ve just seen her—at the Rio Rita!”\\n\\nAmused at the joke, Mrs. Wu burst out laughing. She gave\\nher sister a look and put down the cup.\\n\\n“I’m not joking! It’s quite true! When it came on to rain\\neveryone left, but she’s not home yet! And her room’s flooded\\nout!”\\n\\nLin Pei-shan’s voice rose with excitement as she said this,\\nthen she doubled up with laughter. Mrs. Wu frowned at her\\nsister’s hilarity, which she thought excessive, and was just going\\nto rebuke her when the door swung noisily open and Wu Sun-fu\\nstormed unceremoniously into the room.\\n\\n“Pei-yao! How did Huei-fang manage to run away, without\\nyour knowing?”\\n\\nHis wife realized from his furious voice and expression that\\nher sister had not been joking after all; but she resented his\\nattitude. She rose to her feet and retorted coldly, “She’s not a\\nprisoner, and I’m not a wardress. When she was moody the\\nother day, everybody was trying to get her to go out, and you even\\naccused me of not inviting her out often enough; but now that\\nshe\\'s gone down to the Rio Rita for the afternoon of her own\\naccord, you come along here shouting your head off and making\\na terrible fuss about nothing!”\\n\\n“Well, if you knew she was going out, why couldn’t you stop\\nher until I came home?”\\n\\n“Well, if that isn’t the limit! How was I to know she wasn’t\\nallowed out? Anyway, I wasn’t here when she went out. The\\nfirst I knew about it was when Pei-shan told me she’d seen her\\nat the Rio Rita. Isn’t that right, Pei-shan?”\\n\\n“Nonsense!’ Wu Sun-fu roared. “Nobody’s stopping her from\\ngoing out for a stroll! But this is different: she’s run away! Do\\nyou hear? She’s run away! Look at this note!”\\n\\nHe tossed a ball of paper towards his wife. He threw it so\\nhard that it bounced off the table on to the floor. Mrs. Wu touched\\nit with the toe of her shoe but did not bend down and pick it up.\\nShe suddenly looked worried as she remembered the strange way\\nPei-shan had laughed a moment ago: she must have seen Huei-\\nfang with some man or other at the Rio Ritd! And now Huei-\\nfang had “run away”! All these thoughts came crowding on her\\nmind so quickly that she had no time to weigh them up properly.\\nHer eyes turned involuntarily to the floor again, seeking the ball\\nof paper, but Pei-shan had already picked it up and smoothed\\nit out. A mere three lines of elegant handwriting, unmistakably\\nHuei-fang’s.\\n\\n“I suppose you\\'d already gone out when Su-su came, then?”\\nsaid Wu Sun-fu, his expression a little calmer now. “It strikes\\nme Su-su’s got a hand in this!”\\n\\nSuddenly, his look of exasperation returned as he snatched the\\nnote from his wife and read it carefully once more. Mrs. Wu\\nwas more at ease now. She went and sat on a sofa and said\\n\\ngently:\\n\\n“I don’t think it’s so serious that we need fly into a passion\\nover it. Though Huei-fang does act rather strangely, I admit:\\none moment she wants to shut herself up like a nun, the next,\\nshe wants to go to school; and now she doesn’t even want to live\\nat home, but goes off to live in a Y.W.C.A. hostel of all places—”\\n\\n“Yes, but if she wants to go to school, she’s only got to come\\nand tell me. I\\'d be the last to refuse! There’s no need for her\\nto scribble me a note and slip away as if she were eloping! And\\nif she wants to catch up on her studies before going to school,\\nwhat\\'s wrong with doing it here? If she wants a tutor, I can\\neasily get her one. But no: she wants Su-su to coach her—as if\\nSu-su could!”\\n\\n“Why not leave her to it?” Mrs. Wu suggested in a persuasive\\ntone of voice now that her husband’s rage seemed to have died\\ndowh. “In a few days she’ll have had enough and then she\\'ll\\ncome running back!” Lin Pei-shan now put in, “When I saw\\nSu-su and Huei-fang at the Rio Rita, Huei-fang seemed her usual\\nself and didn’t say much. And Su-su didn’t mention this business,\\neither. I expect they got talking afterwards and decided to do it\\non the spur of the moment. I always thought Huei-fang was\\nrather stubborn, but I realize now that she’s quite easily led!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu nodded and relapsed into silence. He now began\\npacing up and down with his hands clasped behind his back, as\\nif he was still worried about it all and trying to think of a solu-\\ntion. Though he was beginning to realize what was behind his\\nsister’s recalcitrance, it was still a challenge to his authority, and\\nas such he obviously could not afford to ignore it. To make things\\nworse, Pei-shan’s suggestion that Huei-fang was “easily led” had\\nprovided him with another headache. He was well aware that\\nChang Su-su was scatter-brained, meddlesome, and not over-\\nparticular in her choice of friends, and the prospect of his “easily\\nled” sister going to live with her annoyed him. It was unthink-\\nable that he, her elder brother, should stand aside and not inter-\\nvene!\\n\\nHe suddenly stopped and turned to look at his wife. His face\\nlooked gloomier than ever in the half-light, and his eyes glinted\\nangrily. He took a pace towards his wife as if to pounce on her,\\nand she, not knowing what storm was now to burst about her\\nears, felt her heart miss a beat and a cold shudder trickle down\\n\\nher spine. Fortunately for her, there was now an interruption—\\nWang Mah came in to announce a visitor. Wu Sun-fu rolled his\\neyes, then turned and began to go out. As he got to the door\\nhe stopped and turned to his wife again:\\n\\n“Pej-yao! Go straight down to this Y.W.C.A. hostel and fetch\\nHuei-fang home! Whatever happens, I insist that she comes\\nhome!”\\n\\n“What\\'s the hurry? Huei-fang’s stubborn, and you can’t expect\\nher to come back home the very same day that she runs away.”\\n\\nMrs. Wu’s reply had been as tactful as she could make it, but\\nit only made her husband all the more infuriated.\\n\\n“Don’t argue!” he roared. “Get down there straight away!\\nWhatever happens, we must get her back here today! If we\\ndon’t do it today she\\'ll never come back!”\\n\\nWith this order, and without any explanation of what exactly\\nhe meant, Wu Sun-fu hurried downstairs to see his visitor.\\n\\nThe visitor was Wang Ho-fu. He had become impatient wait-\\ning for Wu Sun-fu, and when he saw him coming at last he\\ngrasped him agitatedly by the sleeve and led him into the small\\ndrawing-room. He slammed the door behind him and, without\\neven a word of greeting, plunged straight into his business in a\\nfurtive whisper:\\n\\n“Something urgent! Just had a report from Hsu Man-li! She\\nsays Chao Po-tao knows we\\'re selling short and that he’s going\\nto do his damnedest to put a spoke in our wheel, the rat! He’s\\ngoing to fight it out with us! Though, according to her, Chao\\nPo-tao hasn’t got much to play with, himself!”\\n\\nNot until Wang Ho-fu had finished did Wu Sun-fu breathe\\nagain. He was somewhat relieved to learn that there had not\\nbeen a real disaster as he had for the moment feared. So Chao\\nPo-tao was up to his tricks again, eh? Well, it wouldn\\'t be the\\nfirst time, and Wu Sun-fu had no particular reason to worry on\\nthat score. If Chao Po-tao was now feeling the pinch himself,\\nit was no more than he deserved! That\\'s what comes of trying\\nto put a spoke in the other chap’s wheel all the time!... As these\\nthoughts went through his head, Wu Sun-fu even began to feel\\nexultant again, and a smile came to his lips.\\n\\n“It was only to be expected that Chao Po-tao should go all-out\\nto stop us. Just think, Ho-fu: didn’t we do our best to put his\\n\\nback up when we sold the eight factories? We pretended to do\\nbusiness with him, even after we had already negotiated a sale\\nwith the foreign firm and the Japanese company! The result\\nwas that he lost his broker\\'s commission and in all probability\\ngot a rap on the knuckles from his boss! It was really brilliant\\nthe way Chi-jen pulled it off! Yes, we made a good job of show-\\ning Chao Po-tao up in his true colours to his boss. No wonder\\nhe’s nettled with us!—Though I don’t quite see, Ho-fu, why he\\nshould be feeling the pinch.”\\n\\n“Wait a minute. I\\'ll tell you about his latest trick first. He\\'s\\norganizing some sort of ‘Committee for the Maintenance of Gov-\\nernment Bonds,’ and in their name he’s going to wire a petition\\nto the government to stop the practice of selling short! Our\\nlawyer friend Chiu Chun has also found out from another source\\nthat they’re also going to petition the Ministry of Finance to order\\nthe Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communica-\\ntions, and some other note-issuing banks to accept all types of\\ngovernment bonds as pledges or discount them, and at the same\\ntime to order the Stock Exchange to make it obligatory for\\nsellers to hand in actual bonds as security before making any\\nsale. This would mean the end of all speculative selling by\\nbears—”\\n\\n“But it’s utterly impossible!” interrupted Wu Sun-fu, still smil-\\ning calmly. “It would be tantamount to suspending the busi-\\nness of the Stock Exchange! No, Ho-fu, I think this is just another\\nrumour put round by Chao Po-tao to encourage the bulls!”\\n\\nBut Wang Ho-fu was not to be gainsaid. Perhaps because he\\nhad talked himself into a state of excitement, perhaps because\\nhe was over-anxious—whatever the reason, he was perspiring\\nprofusely. He stared round-eyed at Wu Sun-fu as the latter\\nspoke, then said in a loud voice:\\n\\n“Not a bit of it!—Now, you may think all that’s enough to be\\ngoing on with, but there’s more to come! He\\'s also using his in-\\nfluence to get the Board of Directors of the Stock Exchange and\\nthe Brokers’ Association to issue immediately a new set of reg-\\nulations which will increase the seller’s security to twice the\\nPresent amount! And that, Sun-fu, is quite possible!”\\n\\n“What!—You mean that? And what about the buyer’s de-\\nposit? No increase, I suppose!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu sprang to his feet, the colour draining from his\\ncheeks. He realized he had underestimated his enemy.\\n\\n“Of course I mean it. I got it from Han Meng-hsiang. And\\nLu Kuang-shih says it’s all been fixed up and that it\\'ll be an-\\nnounced tomorrow!”\\n\\n“But it’s illegal!’ protested Wu Sun-fu, shaking his head.\\n“There’re two sides to every transaction—you must have a buyer\\nand a seller, and you can’t make fish of one and fowl of the\\nother! It would be illegal!”\\n\\nThe veins stood out blue on his temples, but curiously enough\\nthere was no sweat on his forehead. Wang Ho-fu slapped his\\nthigh and sighed.\\n\\n“you can eall it illegal if you like, but there it is! I tell you,\\nSun-fu, Chao Po-tao’s making a hullabaloo all round about ‘pre-\\nserving the integrity of government bonds and steadying the\\nmarket,’ and putting it round that the bears are a menace to the\\nmoney market and a dangerous nuisance in the Stock Exchange.\\nHe browbeats the Board of Directors of the Stock Exchange with\\nthis impressive blether, and they just have to give in to him!”\\n\\n“It’s a blatant stab in the back for the bears!” muttered Wu\\nSun-fu through clenched teeth. “It’s scandalous!”\\n\\nHe was now even more apprehensive than Wang Ho-fu had\\nbeen a moment ago. For a while the two men sat silent and\\nfrowning, staring at one another. A motorcar horn sounded just\\noutside, then again at the gate. “That must be Pei-yao going\\nout to fetch Huei-fang home,” thought Wu Sun-fu. “Though why\\ncouldn’t she leave a bit sooner?” His thoughts wandered to Tu\\nChu-chai. This brother-in-law of his was a bit of a coward...\\nwould he dare sell in the circumstances? Wu Sun-fu was far\\nfrom sure, and his heart sank. At length, Wang Ho-fu spoke\\nagain:\\n\\n“Pye been talking it over with Chi-jen, and he thinks roughly\\nthe same as you. He agrees it’s impossible to demand that the\\nactual bonds be deposited before selling them, but he’s certain\\nthat the doubling of the cash deposit for the seller will come\\noff! In which case, every five thousand dollars of Chao Po-tao’s\\nmoney will be equal to ten thousand of ours! This means that\\nhe can jump in just before the settlement and turn the table on\\nus just like that! We don’t stand a chance!”\\n\\n“In that case I suppose we’d better cover as fast as we can.\\nWhen Chao Po-tao has completed his arrangements the prices\\nwill be pushed up!”\\n\\n“But Chi-jen has a different idea, He’s afraid that if we cover\\nnow, itll mean that all our work will have been wasted. He’s\\nfor fighting to the last ditch! The military situation being what\\nit is, the prices can’t very well go up all that much. He thinks\\nwe should take a chance—nothing venture, nothing gain! He\\nsays that if we do go down he’ll look at it as if one of his boats\\nhad been sunk—he’d pretend his two hundred thousand dollars\\nhad gone to the bottom of the river and he\\'d take it quite calmly!\\n—You know, I think Chi-jen’s got something there!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu’s voice was quite firm as he said this, and his\\nbig, round eyes were fixed intently on Wu Sun-fu. Two months\\nbefore a vigorous, stubborn statement like this could have come\\nonly from Wu Sun-fu, but Wu Sun-fu was no longer the man\\nhe had been, and his mind now tended towards caution and com-\\npromise. Now, even with Wang Ho-fu goading him on, he was\\nwavering and hesitant. He frowned dubiously.\\n\\n“But how can we fight to the last ditch?” he asked. “The five\\nhundred thousand dollars we got for the factories is all tied up\\nin bonds, and I have about two hundred thousand more locked\\nup in cocoons and unsold silk. We\\'re stumped without ready\\ncash!”\\n\\n“Ah, I’ve already discussed that with Chi-jen. This is how\\nwe get round it: we three shall find another five hundred thou-\\nsand dollars between us, and at the same time you do everything\\nyou can to get Tu Chu-chai to sell short again. The two things\\ncombined should see us safely through the crisis!”\\n\\n“We can’t rely on Tu Chu-chai, though. The other day when\\nhe agreed to sell short, he actually sold as many as three million,\\nbut I found out the day before yesterday that he’s already\\ncovered — covered as soon as he could make a paltry profit of\\ntwenty dollars for every ten thousand! And he only made that\\nprofit because we’d sold two million! Now I ask you, Ho-fu,\\nwhat’s the use of a coward like that to us? When we got him\\nto go in with us it was on the understanding that we sink or swim\\n\\ntogether, but now it turns out that he was only out to sponge\\non us! What can you do with a man like that?”\\n\\n“T still think you ought to have another go at him, Sun-fu.\\nThe settlement’s so close that, even if Chu-chai won\\'t sell short,\\nit would be a great help to us if he would agree to remain neutral\\nby not turning bull, either!”\\n\\nAs he said this, Wang Ho-fu chuckled and stroked his beard\\nas if he was quite sure that they would win in the end, and Wu\\nSun-fu could not very well refuse to try Tu Chu-chai again. They\\nnow began to discuss how the three of them could raise the five\\nhundred thousand dollars which they would need. Wang Ho-fu\\nspoke unhurriedly, ticking the sums of money off on his fingers:\\n\\n“The new cash deposits in our company amount to about two\\nhundred thousand dollars, which leaves three hundred thousand\\nto be found. The three of us should be able to manage a hun-\\ndred thousand each. And if Tang Yun-shan has had any luck\\nfinding new shareholders in Hongkong, and if he can wire us\\ntwo or three hundred thousand in the next five or six days, we\\'ll\\nbe sitting pretty!—Besides, I got a tip from Huang Fen today\\nthat the military situation is turning in favour of the bears. So,\\nall things considered, we now have a better opportunity than\\nwe\\'ll ever have and we mustn\\'t let it slip through our fingers!\\n—I don’t know what\\'s the matter with you lately, Sun-fu: you\\nseem to have lost all your strength of will!”\\n\\nWu Sun-fu sat in silence for a while, then a flush of excite-\\nment crept into his face and his eyes gleamed. He brought his\\nhand down with a thump on the arm of his chair and growled,\\n“That\\'s it, then! Since you and Chi-jen are so keen on the idea,\\nI\\'m with you! But to tell the truth I’m right out of ready cash.\\nWhat I\\'ll do is to mortgage my own factory! And my house\\nand its grounds are worth well over a hundred thousand. Yes,\\nI think I could raise a couple of hundred thousand on the fac-\\ntory and the house together!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu laughed with elation and gave Wu Sun-fu the\\n“thumbs up” sign. Wu Sun-fu now went on: “There’s only one\\nthing, Ho-fu: 1 think I can mortgage the house all right by\\nmyself, but I\\'ll have to have Chi-jen’s help to find someone for\\nthe factory.”\\n\\n“Tha?ll be all right! I\\'l] tell Chi-jen to come round and see\\nyou. That\\'s settled, then; and you\\'ll be doing your best to talk\\nChu-chai round!”\\n\\nWang Ho-fu was in the best of spirits as he stood up and took\\nhis leave. Just as he was getting into his car he turned round\\nto Wu Sun-fu again and said, “Oh, and another thing, Sun-fu: I\\nhear this woman Liu Yu-ying isn’t very reliable. She’s running\\nwith the hare and hunting with the hounds!”\\n\\n“Aha, so she’s spying for Chao Po-tao as well, is she?—How\\ndo you know?”\\n\\n“Han Meng-hsiang told me. And Hsu Man-li warned me\\nabout her, too. Colonel Lei told her.”\\n\\n“I\\'ll be on my guard against her, then.—So she’s hooked Colonel\\nLei as well, has she?”\\n\\nHe nodded thoughtfully. Wang Ho-fu laughed, then got into\\nthe car and drove off.\\n\\nThe rain had gone over by now, and the sky was bright again,\\nstreaked with yellow clouds like a vast tiger-skin. Wu Sun-fu\\nremained standing on the front steps, lost in thought. He was\\nthinking of the coming “fight to the last ditch” in the Exchange\\nand of the mortgaging of his factory and house. His thoughts\\ncame thick and fast, but he felt sluggish and dispirited. He stood\\nthere a long time, until he was startled out of his reverie by\\nthe arrival of the car with his wife. He remembered he still\\nhad to go and see Tu Chu-chai on his “diplomatic mission.”\\n\\n“Huei-fang utterly refuses to come home!” gasped Mrs. Wu as\\nshe got out of the car. “But the hostel looked a quiet and re-\\nspectable enough place to me, so I think we might let her stay\\non there a few days and see what happens.”\\n\\nShe fully expected another outburst from Wu Sun-fu, but to\\nher relief he just nodded. Then he shepherded her back into the\\ncar and told the chauffeur:\\n\\n“Mr. Tu’s!— Got it? Mr. Tu’s place!”\\n\\nAs she sat beside her husband, Mrs. Wu could not help smil-\\ning. She had not the slightest inkling that Sun-fu was going to\\nsee Tu Chu-chai on business, but naturally assumed that he\\nwas going to pick up his sister Fu-fang and take her with him\\nto help persuade Huei-fang to come home. She could not help\\n\\nS11\\nthinking that he was making mountains out of molehills. In\\nany case, she was beginning to sympathize with Huei-fang, for\\neven she had often thought what a dreary, depressing place the\\nhouse was. As these thoughts passed through her mind, her\\nsmile vanished and gave way to a look of melancholy resigna-\\ntion. Suddenly, she felt her husband’s hand close round hers.\\nShe smiled, stiffly.\\nD.@ .¢\\n\\nAs the clock struck nine and the clear, measured strokes on the\\nvibrating metal coil twanged in the ears of Wu Sun-fu, who was\\nstill asleep in the inner room, his eyelids seemed to flutter, but his\\nmind was still submerged in the heavy black waters of a dream.\\nHe had heard the clear, vibrant strokes of the clock in his dream,\\nbut for him this sound was the urgent voice of the gong on the\\nplatform of the Exchange, the signal for the opening of another\\nsession and the signal for the beginning of a fight to the death\\nfor himself and his partners.\\n\\nIt was these gong-strokes in the dream that had made his\\neyelids flutter. The settlement was only three days off, and in\\nthe last few days Wu Sun-fu and his partners had thrown the\\nlast reinforcements they had been able to muster into the front\\nline and waged a fierce offensive along the whole front, but\\nnothing they could do seemed of any avail in dislodging the bulls\\nfrom their position. Their only hope now was that Tu Chu-chai\\nwould rush in to their rescue. The night before, Wu Sun-fu had\\nworked until the small hours trying to persuade Tu Chu-chai to\\ncome in with them. And this had been the fourth time he had\\ntried! Tu Chu-chai had not yet refused outright, so they still\\nhad a glimmer of hope—though they realized that whatever hap-\\npened they were still not out of the wood!\\n\\nA despairing laugh came from the sleeping Wu Sun-fu, then\\nhis brows were drawn tightly together and he clenched his teeth\\nand shuddered violently. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, blood-\\nshot eyes that stared fixedly as if in a trance, and tiny beads of\\nsweat began breaking out on his forehead as he remembered the\\nhorror of his dream. A pale yellow sunlight threw shadows on\\nthe curtains and a faint breeze brought the hum of traffic from\\nthe distant street.\\n\\n“Thank Heaven it was only a dream!” he thought, as he scram-\\npled quickly out of bed. He had a wash, only to find Chao Po-\\ntao’s face grinning at him from the water in the wash-basin—\\njt was the face that had haunted his dreams with its evil, gloat-\\ning smile! As he was going past his dressing-mirror, he auto-\\nmatically glanced at it and saw his own face——a face stamped\\ndeep with the lines of defeat and despair. Down in the drawing-\\nroom and the dining-room, the servants were bustling round\\nchanging loose covers and taking the carpets up for beating. The\\nmoment his eye fell on this scene of activity, he remembered\\nthat the house was mortgaged and that if he could not pay back\\nthe loan in time his creditors would foreclose, and then there\\nwould be all the bustle and commotion of moving out.\\n\\nIt seemed to him that the house was full of leering eyes\\ngiorying in his misfortune. He felt that sitting here in the “rear”\\nwaiting for news was ten, twenty times more painful than going\\nup to the “front” himself. Little caring that he had made an\\nappointment with Sun Chi-jen for ten o’clock, he hurried straight\\nout to the car and drove off.\\n\\nAlthough the car was speeding along a fairly unfrequented road\\nat the record speed for 1930, Wu Sun-fu felt that even the car\\nwas trying to thwart him by refusing to go faster. He suddenly\\ndiscovered that, without his noticing it, even the dismal pale\\nsunlight had disappeared, and that they were driving through a\\nfine drizzle which looked more like a thick mist. There was\\nsomething strangely familiar about his gloomy surroundings—\\nas well there might be! For it was on just such a morning as\\nthis—a morning of misty drizzle when everything became blurred\\nin outline and acquired an air of grandeur—that he had once\\nbefore sat in his car plunging headlong in just the same way into\\nan unknown, misty future. Suddenly, it all came back to him:\\ntwo months before, when he had been co-operating with Chao\\nPo-tao as a bull, the morning of their “decisive battle” had been\\njust such a gloomy, wet morning as this! Nevertheless, though\\nthe scene was the same, their roles had now been drastically\\nchanged: he and Chao Po-tao were now at daggers drawn! To\\nmake things worse, an inscrutable Tu Chu-chai held their fates\\nin the balance!\\n\\nAs he sat there in the car, Wu Sun-fu smiled grimly to himself:\\nWhat point was there in going down to the Exchange at all? The\\nreally decisive days had been the last three, and they had gona,\\nEverything humanly possible had been done and their last penny\\nhad already been thrown into the struggle: What difference could\\nhe or anyone make to the fortunes of battle at this late hour?\\nYes, today would be the final skirmish, as when a commander-\\nin-chief sends even his own bodyguard to the front line in a last\\ndesperate offensive. But surely it would be enough to leave the\\nexecution of his orders to his front-line commander without go-\\ning up to the front himself? Wu Sun-fu frowned and smiled\\nwryly to himself as he decided to go back home and wait for\\nnews there; yet he could not bring himself to tell his chauffeur\\nto turn back. He had now lost even the small amount of will-\\npower needed to do this! No matter how anxiously he urged\\nhimself to ‘Keep calm! Even if you lose, you must keep calm!”\\nhe still found it impossible to repress his excitement,\\n\\nHe was still in this state of anxiety and doubt when the car\\ndrew up outside the Exchange. He threaded his way in through\\nthe main entrance as if in a dream and went straight over to the\\nnotice-board to find the number of his broker, Lu Kuang-shih.\\nTrading had apparently not yet begun, yet the Exchange rang with\\nthe deafening din of voices. But Wu Sun-fu appeared to be blind\\nand deaf to all this: all he saw was a vision of Chao Po-tao’s face,\\nwhich seemed to fill all the space.\\n\\nLu Kuang-shih’s cubicle, which was not much bigger than a\\nsentry-box, was completely occupied by a corpulent gentleman\\n—it was, as a matter of fact, Wang Ho-fu—who was using the\\ntelephone. The broker himself stood outside talking with a floor-\\nman. Wu Sun-fu’s arrival attracted no attention until he stopped\\nin front of the cubicle, when Lu Kuang-shih suddenly turned\\nround to find him standing there. Just at that moment Wang\\nHo-fu hung up the receiver,\\n\\n“Ah! Sun-fu! Here you are! I’ve just been trying to get you\\non the phone!”\\n\\nAs Wang Ho-fu sprang up to greet him, he grasped Wu Sun-\\nfu by the sleeve and pulled him into the cubicle, where he wedged\\nhim in the corner beside the telephone, as if he was afraid to ex-\\npose his friend to public view. The latter smiled cheerlessly and\\n\\nwould have spoken had he not been too agitated to find some-\\nthing to say. As it was, Wang Ho-fu immediately bent over and\\nasked in a whisper:\\n\\n“You haven\\'t seen Sun Chi-jen yet, have you? Oh, well, he’\\nbe here in a moment. What about Tu Chu-chai? Has he made\\nup his mind yet?”\\n\\n“Not quite. Though I don’t think he’ll put much on the\\nmarket, in any case. Not more than a million, anyway.”\\n\\nThe moment Wu Sun-fu had opened his mouth and said some-\\nthing, his optimism had begun to return and he now felt some-\\nwhat calmer. Wang Ho-fu stroked his beard and smiled.\\n\\n“you think he\\'d sell a million? That would be splendid! The\\nthing is, Sun-fu, we\\'re left high and dry today! The mortgaging\\nof your factory didn’t come off. Chi-jen and I have tried every-\\nbody we can think of, but we’ve had no luck at all. All we can\\ndo today is to—”\\n\\n“ts to what? Don’t tell me we haven\\'t even got the hundred\\nthousand dollars left that we agreed on the day before yesterday!”\\n\\n“No, it’s all right! Though it’s all we’ve got in reserve for\\ntoday.”\\n\\n“Right, then, get rid of the lot the moment they open! Agreed?\\nHave you told Han Meng-hsiang what we\\'re doing yet?”\\n\\n“Don\\'t let me hear you mention Han Meng-hsiang’s name\\nagain! I found out only last night that even he isn’t reliable!\\nEvery time we\\'ve sold short we’ve done it through him for\\nsecrecy’s sake, and—would you believe it?—he’s now gone and\\ngiven the show away to Chao Po-tao! It’s the worst thing that\\ncould have happened!”\\n\\nAs Wang Ho-fu said this, he dropped his voice until it was\\nscarcely audible. Wu Sun-fu did not catch every word, but he\\nunderstood perfectly. His face suddenly paled, his ears buzzed,\\nand black spots danced madly before his eyes. Another of his\\nsubordinates had sold the pass! This was the unkindest cut of\\nall! After a moment, Wu Sun-fu finally managed to mutter\\nthrough clenched teeth: “You can’t trust anybody!—Well, Ho-fu,\\nI suppose we’ll have to go through Lu Kuang-shih today?”\\n\\n“No! I\\'ve found another broker and everything’s already fixed\\nup. The moment they open, we sell!”\\n\\nHardly were the words out of his mouth when the gong sounded\\nfor the opening. Immediately, a thunderous uproar arose as trad-\\ning began, until the building seemed to shake. Wang Ho-fu ran\\nout, but Wu Sun-fu remained sitting where he was, unable to\\nmove. His legs no longer obeyed him, the buzzing in his ears\\ncame back again, and the black spots once more danced before\\nhis eyes. He had never felt as weak as this before~it was\\nfantastic!\\n\\nSuddenly, Wang Ho-fu ran back, panting and dejected; he\\nwrung his hands as he gasped, “Opened with a rise! Up fifty\\ncents!”\\n\\n“What!-—Sell out quick!” raved Wu Sun-fu, springing to his\\nfeet. “Get rid of the whole hundred thousand in reserve!”\\n\\nSuddenly, Wu Sun-fu’s head swam and he had a feeling of\\nnausea in the pit of his stomach. His legs gave way under him\\nand he collapsed, his eyes staring and his face deathly pale. Wang\\nHo-fu was so startled that he felt suddenly cold, but quickly step-\\nped forward; he pinched Wu Sun-fu’s upper lip with one hand\\nand held him by the hair with the other. For a moment there\\nwas no one on hand to help; then, as luck would have it, Sun\\nChi-jen arrived. Cool and resourceful, he snatched up a glass\\nof cold water, took a mouthful of it, and spurted it in Wu Sun-\\nfu’s face. The glazed eyes stirred, and Wu Sun-fu brought up\\na gobbet of phlegm.\\n\\n“Sell out quick—” he repeated, his eyes Staring wildly. Sun\\nChi-jen and Wang Ho-fu exchanged glances, then Sun Chi-jen\\npatted Wu Sun-fu on the shoulder and said, “Don’t worry, Sun-\\nfu! Ho-fu and I are here to take care of everything. You\\'d bet-\\nter go home and take it easy. It’s suffocating in here and you\\'ll\\nonly be worse if you stay!”\\n\\n“It’s nothing!” said Wu Sun-fu, springing to his feet. “It was\\njust a touch of phlegm, and I’m all right now.—But tell me, have\\nyou sold them yet?”\\n\\nHis face was a better colour now, and life was returning to\\nhis eyes, though his forehead was as red as fire. Sun Chi-jen\\nnoticed it and recognized it as a serious sign. Between them,\\nSun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu forcibly dragged Wu Sun-fu out\\nof the Exchange in spite of all his protests and bundled him into\\nhis car. Meanwhile the Exchange resounded with the fiercest\\n\\nduel between the bulls and the bears that it had ever known. Wu\\nSun-fu’s partners fired their last shot—they threw one and a half\\nmillion Disbandment on the market, and the quotations began to\\ndrop steadily!\\n\\nIf Wu Sun-fu’s supposed ally Tu Chu-chai had now come on\\nthe scene and thrown himself into the fray with them, victory\\nwould have been assured for the bears. As it happened, Tu\\nChu-chai’s car pulled up in front of the Exchange just as Wu\\nSun-fu’s was moving off. The two chauffeurs honked a greeting\\nat each other in passing, but neither’s employer noticed what was\\nhappening. At the moment when Tu Chu-chai’s car grated to a\\nstop, Wu Sun-fu’s was already speeding homewards.\\n\\n*\\n\\nIt may have been the noise and lack of fresh air on the floor\\nof the Exchange that had brought on Wu Sun-fu’s attack of gid-\\ndiness, for he felt much better as soon as the car started up.\\nThe hectic flush on his temples was gradually fading, and he\\ncould think “soberly” once again, though this “sober” thinking\\nbrought some of the pallor back to his cheeks and made his heart\\nseem like a heavy weight in his chest, so that he had difficulty\\nin breathing.\\n\\nThe drizzle had now become a downpour, and the wind had\\nan edge to it. When Wu Sun-fu arrived home and got out of the\\ncar, he shivered and went goosefiesh all over. Ah-hsuan and\\nPei-shan were laughing and shouting noisily in the drawing-\\nroom, and just as Wu Sun-fu was going past the door, Ah-hsuan\\ndashed out with a book in his hand, pursued by Pei-shan. Wu\\nSun-fu frowned, but walked on without another look at them.\\nJust lately he had ‘ceased to bother himself with such minor\\n“breaches of the peace.” Besides, Huei-fang’s recalcitrance seemed\\nto have struck a blow at his authority in his own household, for\\nAh-hsuan, for one, was becoming rowdier than he had ever been\\nbefore.\\n\\nAs soon as he was seated in his study, Wu Sun-fu sent for the\\nbutler. His first order was “Send for Dr. Ting”; his second was\\n“Tm not at home to visitors”; his third—he broke off as he sud-\\ndenly caught sight of a telegram on the desk. He waved the\\nbutler away and tore open the envelope.\\n\\nThe telegram was from Tang Yun-shan in Hongkong and con-\\ntained forty or so words in code. By the time he had decoded\\nseven or eight words, he had completely forgotten about the\\nthird that he had been going to give. Suddenly, he remembered\\nthere was something else he was going to do. He laid the tele-\\ngram aside and picked up the telephone. After a moment’s\\nhesitation he rang Tu Chu-chai’s home number. When he heard\\nwhere Tu Chu-chai had gone, he smiled. The last dying glimmer\\nof hope in his mind now revived and became stronger and\\nstronger.\\n\\nWhat raised his hopes higher than ever was the discovery that\\nTang Yun-shan’s telegram was full of good news: apparently,\\nTang Yun-shan was getting results in Hongkong, and the mili-\\ntary situation was turning in their favour; he had made a number\\nof extremely valuable business contacts in Hongkong, and with\\ntheir assistance the Yi Chung Company could be put on its feet\\nagain; and, finally, he was coming back to Shanghai immediately.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu was unable to repress a sudden burst of laughter.\\nHeaven helps them who help themselves, and no mistake about\\nit!\\n\\nYet almost immediately his elation began to fade. A faint\\nsmile still hovered on his lips, but it was a wry one. What if\\nall this talk about “extremely valuable business contacts in\\nHongkong” were just another of Tang Yun-shan’s castles in the\\nair? It wouldn’t be the first time he’d been caught that way!\\nIn any case, even if there was anything in what he said, “You\\nwon’t put out a fire with water a league away!” The outcome\\nof the struggle would be decided by the next day at the very\\nlatest, and all Wu Sun-fu and his partners were interested in now\\nwas immediate help, for only immediate help could save them!\\n\\nEven if Tang Yun-shan had struck lucky this time, Wu Sun-fu\\nwas still displeased with the man’s muddle-headedness. Hadn\\'t\\nhe sent him telegram after telegram urging him to wire any\\nmoney back the moment he laid hands on it? And still all he\\ngot was promises! And what did he mean by “coming back to\\nShanghai immediately”? Anyone would think Hongkong was\\nstill living in the eighteenth century and using bulky silver ingots\\nwhich Tang Yun-shan could only bring back to Shanghai in per-\\n\\nson! Here was he crying out for money which Tang Yun-shan\\nwas blithely carrying round in his pocket!\\n\\nAs he thought this, even the faint, wry smile vanished from\\nhis face. To meet with disappointment after having one’s hopes\\nraised was more painful than never having one’s hopes raised at\\nallt At first, when he had just decoded the telegram, he had\\nthought of ringing up Sun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu to tell them\\nthe good news, but now it was more than he dared do. As he\\nsat there with his head in his hands, he felt as if his head was\\non fire. He stood up and began pacing to and fro, but he shivered\\nat every step, and he felt as if cold water were trickling down his\\nspine. He sat down again, but immediately stood up once more,\\nonly to sit down a second time. One moment he felt as if he\\nwas in a furnace; the next, as if he had been plunged into an\\nice-house!\\n\\nHe was at last forced to admit to himself that he was ill. Yes,\\never since the go-slow in the factory he had been troubled by this\\nstrange malady, and just lately the attacks had become more\\nfrequent. And now it had come to this—being overcome with\\ndizziness in the Exchange! It looked suspiciously like the first\\nstages of congestion of the brain—the illness his father had died\\noft “What\\'s happened to the doctor? Blast him! Just when\\nI need him urgently, he lets me down!\"—He was so eager to gel\\nsomeone to vent his anger on!\\n\\nSuddenly, the telephone rang, and its jangle seemed to hold\\na note of urgency.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu went suddenly tense all over. He was certain it\\nwas a call from Sun Chi-jen on the Exchange floor. His hand\\ntrembled as he picked up the receiver. He gritted his teeth for\\na weak “Hullo?” then held his breath as he listened to what\\nSun Chi-jen had to report about their desperate struggle His\\neyebrows suddenly shot up and his eyes gleamed excitedly and\\nfinally he even smiled.\\n\\n“Oh!... Up and then down again, eh?... What! Dropped to\\nthirty-three dollars? ... Whew!... What a pity!... Well, it looks\\nas if the bulls are losing their appetite at last!... What did you\\nsay? ‘Reorganization’ is opening now?... What?... Selling an-\\nother two million?... The deposit on credit?... By all means!...\\nI just got a telegram from Tang Yun-shan—says he’s struck lucky\\n\\nin Hongkong.... Yes, we may as well go the whole hog!... No,\\nhe hasn’t sent the money yet, but I think it’s ali right to go ahead\\njust the same!... Oh, so Chao Po-tao’s risking all he\\'s got, as\\nwell!—Makes us quits!... It shows what a rat Han Meng-hsiang\\nis! If he hadn’t gone over to the other side, Chao Po-tao would\\nhave given up yesterday!... You bet! We\\'ll teach the little rat\\na lesson he won\\'t forget in a hurry!... Chu-chai? He\\'s already\\ndown there at the Exchange!... Haven’t seen him yet? Well, have\\na look round.... Oh!...”\\n\\nAs Wu Sun-fu hung up, his features darkened again. This time\\nhe was not so much worried as angry. So Han Meng-hsiang had\\nlet him down, the scoundrel! And Liu Yu-ying, too! Lining her\\npockets from both sides, the bitch! It had always been the same:\\nall his great schemes had been wrecked by subordinates with\\nneither conscience nor loyalty! It put one’s teeth on edge to\\nthink about them! He had always played fair and never let\\nanyone down, but his kindness was always repaid with ungrate-\\nful treachery! Apart from those two wretches Han Meng-hsiang\\nand Liu Yu-ying, even his own sister had turned on him, and\\nhad now run away from home as if he were a cruel monster!\\n\\nA wave of anger swept over him, and he trembled from head\\nto foot. His face pale with rage and his teeth clenched, he began\\npacing swiftly up and down. These last few days his prestige\\nhad been trampled in the mud! He must do something about\\nit! As soon as the present crisis on the Exchange was over, he\\nmust firmly re-establish his waning authority! Both in public\\nand in his own home he must again set himself up as the in-\\ncarnation of authority! As he paced to and fro, he began plan-\\nning all that he would be and do, once he had won this present\\nbattle on the Exchange!\\n\\nSuddenly the telephone rang again with that same note of\\nurgency.\\n\\nThis time he was not so nervous as he had been the time be-\\nfore, for he had already been fortified by the good news so far.\\nAs he picked up the receiver his hand was steady and deft. As\\na voice spoke at the other end of the line, he cried:\\n\\n“That you, Ho-fu?... What is it?... Never mind that! Tell me\\nwhat\\'s happening!”\\n\\nA sudden blast of wind swept through the garden and howled\\nin the trees. As he listened, Wu Sun-fu’s face suddenly paled.\\n\\n“What!” he gasped. “Up again?... Somebody buying in while\\nwe\\'re holding the price down?... Eh? Not Chao Po-tao? A new\\nbull? Who? Who?... What! Chu-chai?... Well, Pll be damned!...\\nWe\\'re sunk, then! Finished!...”\\n\\nCrash! The receiver fell on to the desk as Wu Sun-fu staggered\\nback and collapsed on a sofa, where he sat wide-eyed and panting.\\nEven his own brother-in-law Chu-chai had stabbed him in the\\nback. It was only the night before that he had been perfectly\\nfrank with Tu Chu-chai and told him exactly what the situation\\non the stock market was and what his own plans were—and\\nall the time he had been playing into the hands of a traitor!—\\n“Every man’s hand against me and even my own relatives be-\\ntraying me! What have I done—what have I done to deserve\\nit?” As this one thought hammered at his tortured mind, he\\nsuddenly sprang up with a wild laugh and pounced forward; he\\nwrenched open a drawer of his desk, snatched out a revolver,\\nand turned the muzzle towards his heart. His face was purple,\\nand his eyes glared as if they would burst from their sockets.\\n\\nOutside, the gale howled and drove the rain against the window\\nin a crackling fury. The gun had not been fired. Wu Sun-fu\\ndrew a long sigh and collapsed on to the swivel-chair. The re-\\nvolver fell to the floor. Just then Li Kuei, one of the servants,\\ncame in with Dr. Ting.\\n\\nWu Sun-fu leapt to his feet and smiled wryly at the doctor.\\n“Sorry to trouble you: there might have been a little accident\\njust now, but it’s all right now.—Though now that you’ve come\\nperhaps you\\'d like to take a seat.”\\n\\nDr. Ting shrugged his shoulders in wonder, but before he could\\nsay anything, Wu Sun-fu had turned and snatched up the re-\\nceiver again. This time he was ringing the factory. Having\\nchecked that it was Tu Wei-yueh on the other end, he shouted\\none peremptory sentence into the receiver: “The factory closes\\ndown tomorrow!” Disregarding the bewildered twittering from\\nthe other end of the line, he hung up and turned a smiling face to\\nDr. Ting:\\n\\n“Where do you suggest I go for my summer holiday, Doctor?\\nI feel like a breath of sea air!”\\n\\n$22\\n“Tsingtao, without a doubt! Or if you\\'d like to go farther afield,\\nChinwangtao is quite pleasant!”\\n\\n“How about Kuling?”\\n\\n“Kuling’s all right, but you won’t find your sea air up there!\\nBesides, I heard a day or so ago that the Red Army is attacking\\nChian. Changsha is surrounded, and Nanchang and Kiukiang\\nare both threatened!—”\\n\\n“Ha! Ha! Ha! What does it matter? I’ve always wanted to\\nhave a look at this Red Army that everybody’s so afraid of and\\nsee if it’s all it’s made out to be! As likely as not they’ll prove\\nto be nothing more than bandits! The only reason they’ve got\\naway with it so long is that nobody’s troubled to do anything\\nabout them! Excuse me a moment, Doctor. If you\\'ll just make\\nyourself at home I\\'ll go and see to one or two things. Won\\'t\\nkeep you a moment.”\\n\\nLaughing hilariously, Wu Sun-fu left the study and ran straight\\nupstairs. Now that he realized it was all over, he was beginning\\nto feel calm and peaceful once more. He slipped quietly into his\\nroom and found his wife curled up on the sofa under window\\nwith a book.\\n\\n“Pei-yao! Hurry up and tell the servants to pack! We\\'re leav-\\ning tonight for our summer holiday!”\\n\\nHis wife leapt to her feet thunderstruck. The book fell off\\nher lap on to the floor and a faded white rose fluttered out from\\nbetween the pages. This was the third time Wu Sun-fu had seen\\nthe book and the rose, but, as on the other two occasions, he was\\nfoo preoccupied to notice them. Her cheeks flushed, his wife\\nglanced down at them and said absently:\\n\\n“That’s rather short notice, isn’t it? Still, anything you say.”\\n\\n— THE END —\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\n\\nShen Yen-ping, better known by his pen-name Mao Tun, was\\nporn in 1896 in Tunghsiang in the province of Chekiang. He is\\none of the most outstanding exponents of revolutionary realism\\nto appear in China since the New Literature Movement began\\nin 1919. In November 1920, together with Cheng Chen-to, Yeh\\nSheng-tao and other writers, he founded the “Society for Literary\\nStudies,” one of the first organizations to be formed in China for\\nthe purpose of fostering new trends in literature. In 1921 he\\nbecame editor of the Fiction, a literary monthly published by the\\nCommercial Press in Shanghai. He completely overhauled this\\nperiodical and through it launched a fierce attack on feudalistic\\nand compradore influences in current Chinese literature.\\n\\nFrom 1926 to 1927 he edited the Minkuojihpao, a Hankow daily\\ndevoted to the cause of the revolution. When Chiang Kai-shek\\nbetrayed the revolution, and the Kuomintang became firmly anti-\\nCommunist, he left Hankow and returned to Shanghai.\\n\\nIn 1927 he began to use the pen-name Mao Tun for his novel-\\nwriting, which served to expose the evils of the reactionary Kuo-\\nmintang régime and to reflect the revolutionary struggle of the\\npeople. His works of this period comprise the novels The Can-\\nker —a_ trilogy — (1927), The Rainbow (1930), “If Three Walk To-\\ngether .. .” (1931), and Midnight (1933), as well as a number of\\nshort stories, essays, and articles on a variety of subjects.\\n\\nDuring the anti-Japanese war (1937-1945) Mao Tun kept up his\\nliterary activities by editing the periodical The Literary Front\\nand writing the novels Decay (1941) and Frosted Leaves As Red\\nAs Flowers in Spring (1942), the play Before and After the Ching-\\nming Festival (1944), besides various short stories, essays and\\narticles.\\n\\nIn 1949, after the founding of the Chinese People’s Republic,\\nMao Tun was made Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation\\nof Writers and Artists, Chairman of the Chinese Writers’ Union,\\nand Minister of Culture in the Central People\\'s Government. In\\n1954 he was elected Deputy to the First National People’s Con-\\ngress while continuing to hold the portfolio of Minister of Culture.\\n\\nDocument generated by Anna’s Archive around 2023-2024 as part of the DuXiu collection\\n(https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-exclusive.html).Images have been losslessly embedded.
