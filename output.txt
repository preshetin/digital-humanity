THE sun had just sunk below the horizon and a gentle breeze
caressed one’s face. The muddy water of Soochow Creek, trans-
formed to a golden green, flowed quietly westward. The eve-
ning tide from the Whangpoo had turned imperceptibly, and now
the assortment of boats along both sides of the creek were riding
high, their decks some six inches above the landing-stages. Faint
strains of music were borne on the wind from the park across
the river, punctuated by the sharp, cheerful patter of kettle-
drums. Under a sunset-mottled sky, the towering framework
of Garden Bridge was mantled in a gathering mist. Whenever
a tram passed over the bridge, the overhead cable suspended
below the top of the steel frame threw off bright, greenish
sparks. Looking east, one could see the warehouses on the
waterfront of Pootung like huge monsters crouching in the gloom,
their lights twinkling like countless tiny eyes. To the west,
one saw with a shock of wonder on the roof of a building a
gigantic neon sign in flaming red and phosphorescent green:
LIGHT, HEAT, POWER.

It was a perfect May evening. Three 1930-model Citroens
flashed over the bridge, turned westward, and headed straight
along the North Soochow Road. Passing a block west of the
Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Building on the corner of
North Honan Road, where the creek below was usually thronged
with steam-launches plying upriver, the three cars slowed down.
The driver of the first car said in a low voice to the hulking
fellow sitting beside him in black silk:

“The Tai Sheng Chang Company, isn’t it, Kuan?”

“Of course it is,’ replied his companion, also in a low voice.
“Surely you haven't forgotten already? That bitch must be mak-
ing you soft in the head.”
As the bodyguard, for such he was, spoke, he showed large,
strong teeth. The car jarred to a stop and Kuan quickly
scrambied out, placing his hand on the Browning at his side
as he did so and glancing all round. Then he went round and
opened the other door and stood holding it, looking stern and
forbidding. A head stuck out cautiously—-a square, pimply,
purplish face with thick eyebrows and round eyes. Spotting the
signboard over the gate with the name “The Tai Sheng Chang
Shipping Company,” the man emerged completely and quickly
made for the building with his bodyguard close behind him.

“Is the Flying Cloud arriving soon?” the purplish-faced man
asked in a loud and arrogant voice. About forty, powerfully built
and imposing, he struck you at once as a solid and prosperous
businessman, accustomed to giving orders. Before the words
were out of his mouth, the clerks sitting there in the office
jumped up as one man, and a tall, thin young man, smiling
broadly, stepped forward.

“Yes, Mr. Wu, very soon,” he answered respectfully. “Please
take a seat.” He turned to a boy: “Go and get some tea.”

While he was speaking he drew up a chair and placed it
behind the visitor, whose fleshy face twitched in what could
have been a smile as he glanced at the young man, and then
looked out towards the street. By now the visitor’s car had
moved on to make room for the second, out of which a man
and a woman appeared and came into the hall. The man was
short and stoutish with a bland and pallid face, while the woman
was much taller, and bore a certain resemblance to the other
man with her square face, although her skin was smooth and
fair. Both she and her husband were in their forties, but in
her fashionable dress she did not look more than thirty. The
husband greeted the first arrival:

“why, hello, Sun-fu! Are we all waiting here?”

Before the purplish-faced man could answer, the spindly youth
quickly chimed in with a broad smile:

“Yes, here, Mr. Tu. I’ve just heard her hooter and sent some-
one to keep a look-out at the landing-stage. He’ll run back as
soon as the boat arrives. I don’t think we’ll have to wait more
than five minutes. Only five more minutes.”
“Ah, Fu Sheng! I’m very glad to see you're still here. Yes,
the best way to learn a trade is to stick to it. Father has often
said you’re very keen. How long is it since you saw the old man
last?”

“T paid a visit to Old Mr. Wu only a month ago while I was
home on leave,” babbled the spindly youth Fu Sheng in reply,
dazzled by Mrs. Tu’s compliments; then, placing a chair behind
her and another behind her husband, he begged her to take a
seat.

Then he bustled about serving tea and offering cigarettes round.
This young man was the son of an old servant of the Wu family.
He had always been a nimble-witted lad, so Old Mr. Wu had
asked his son Sun-fu to put him in this shipping office as an
employee. The two men and the woman remained standing,
looking every now and then towards the entrance. There at the
gate another hefty fellow was standing with his back to the
door, looking vigilantly right and left —- Mr. Tu’s bodyguard.

Mrs. Tu sat down first with a sigh of relief. She dabbed her
lips with a print silk handkerchief, then said over her shoulder
to Mr. Wu:

“When I went home with Chu-chai last year to visit the an-
cestral graves, we travelled on this same Flying Cloud. It’s a
fast boat and didn’t stop on the way, and we did the journey in
half a day, but it did roll terribly, and made my joints ache.
I’m sure father must be having an awful time of it today. Of
course, being paralysed like that, he can hardly move a muscle.”
She turned to her husband: “Chu-chai, do you remember how
father complained of feeling giddy last year when he had been
sitting down too long... ?”

Mrs. Tu paused and sighed slightly, her eyes reddening at the
edges. She was going to say something more when a steam-
whistle screeched, and a boy dashed in announcing excitedly:

“The boat’s drawing level with the landing-stage!”

Mrs. Tu instantly rose, laying a hand on Mr. Tu’s shoulder.
Fu Sheng dashed out, at the same time looking back to say:

“Mr. Wu, Mr. Tu, Mrs. Tu, there’s no need to hurry. Wait till
I’ve seen to things before you come out.”

All the clerks in the office began to bustle about. Somebody
summoned two stout porters who had been standing by, and

who immediately ran in, took up a cane-chair, and carried it
off. Wu Sun-fu, looking out on the street, said to Mrs. Tu:

“On our way home you’ll sit with father in the first car —
No. 1889. I'll keep Huei-fang company in the second, and Chu-
chai’ll have Ah-hsuan in the third.”

Mrs. Tu nodded and looked towards the entrance, moving her
lips as she silently recited Buddhist sutras. A cigar in his
mouth and a smile on his lips, Tu Chu-chai glanced at Wu Sun-
fu as much as to say: Let’s go now. Just then Fu Sheng came
back frowning with annoyance.

“What a nuisance!” he said. “There is a Soochow Line tug
occupying the landing-stage.”

“That doesn’t matter: let’s go and see,” Wu Sun-fu inter-
rupted and made off with his bodyguard. Tu Chu-chai and
his wife followed; Fu Sheng and the other bodyguard, who had
been standing at the door, brought up the rear.

The Flying Cloud was moored alongside a tug, commonly
known as a “company boat.” The large cane-chair was placed
in readiness on the foredeck, the two bearers waiting on either
side. Along the wharf there was not the usual bustle and din.
On the landing-stage several men from the shipping company
were shouting and trying to shoo off the rickshawmen and
hawkers, who kept pushing forward. While Wu Sun-fu and
the Tu couple were picking their way across the deck of the
tug, a cabin boy helped Old Mr. Wu out on deck and sat him
down in the cane-chair. Fu Sheng ran up and made signs to
the bearers to hoist up the old man and carry him carefully on
to the “company boat.” The old man was met by his son,
daughter, and son-in-law, who were relieved to find him none
the worse for the voyage, except for red blotches on his temples.
But he did not speak; he merely glanced at them, nodded his
head slightly, and closed his eyes.

Huei-fang, the old man’s fourth daughter, and Ah-hsuan, his
seventh son, also came aboard the tug from the Flying Cloud.

“How did father feel on the journey, Huei-fang?’ Mrs. Tu
asked her younger sister in a whisper.

“Pretty well, though he kept saying that he felt giddy.”
“Let's hurry up and get to the cars,” said Wu Sun-fu impa-
tiently. “Fu Sheng, go and tell the chauffeur to bring the new
car round first.”

Leaving the old gentleman in the care of the ladies, Wu Sun-
fu, Tu Chu-chai, and the lad Ah-hsuan went ashore first. The
new car drove up, while the bearers landed the cane-chair with
its occupant. They got the old man settled in the car, and Mrs.
Tu took her place beside him. Her perfume seemed to wake
him, and he opened his eyes to see who it was and said in a
slow and quavering voice:

“Is that you, Fu-fang? I also want Huei-fang to come with
me—and Ah-hsuan as well.”

Wu Sun-fu, who was in the second car, heard this and frowned
slightly, but said nothing. He knew how eccentric and obstinate
his father was—so did Chu-chai. So Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan
squeezed into the car beside their father. Fu-fang, who couldn't
bear to leave her father, remained where she was, so that the
old man was now sandwiched between his two daughters. The
engine started up but as the car moved forward the old man
suddenly cried in a shrill voice:

“The Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments.’*

It was a strange, strident cry —a flare of light in an old
flickering life. His old eyes gleamed, the faint reddish patches
on his temples turned a deep red, and his lips trembled.

The driver immediately braked and cast a startled glance
over his shoulder. The other two cars also stopped. Nobody
knew what had happened. Only Huei-fang understood what it
was her father wanted. Fu Sheng had come up, and she told
him:

“Fu Sheng, run back to the cabin and look for a book in a
yellow damask-covered case.”

Twenty-five years before Old Mr. Wu had had a fall from a
horse, and an injury to his leg had led to partial paralysis. He
had since developed a strong faith in the religious book on virtue
rewarded and vice punished. Every year he had given free copies
of the book to fellow-believers as a practice of virtue. He had
also copied the whole book in his own neat and pious hand, and

* An ancient book based on the belief in divine retribution.

this transcript had become for him a talisman against vice, with
which he could never part for a moment.

Very soon Fu Sheng was back with the book. Old Mr. Wu
took it and laid it reverently on his lap. He closed his eyes
again, a faint smile of peace on his shrivelled lips.

“Carry on now, driver,” Mrs. Tu ordered quietly. With a sigh
of relief, she sank back into her seat and rested her head against
the cushioned back, smiling with satisfaction. The cars were
gathering speed, turning east along the North Soochow Road,
crossing Hongkew Bridge, turning south, then racing along at
half a mile a minute, the record speed for the 1930 model.

*

It is one of life’s little ironies that someone should be driving
through the wide streets of Shanghai—that great city of the
East with a population of three million—in such a modern con-
veyance as a motorcar, yet holding the Supreme Scriptures in
his hands, his mind intent upon one text: “Of all the vices
sexual indulgence is the cardinal; of all the virtues filial picty
is the supreme.” In the case of Old Mr. Wu, the irony was all
the more remarkable because he genuinely believed in the
Supreme Scriptures, unlike those “virtuous fellows” of Shanghai
who swindle money out of the public under the cloak of religion.
Thirty years back, Old Mr. Wu had been a member of a political
party which had agitated for reforms. In spite of the fact that
his father and grandfather had been high-ranking officials enjoy-
ing the Emperor’s generosity in no small degree, he was full
of the revolutionary ideas of the time, and as a young man had
been a leading light in the universal conflict between fathers and
sons of those days. He would probably not now be buried all
day in his Supreme Scriptures but for the fact that he had fallen
from his horse in a cavalry exercise and received an injury to
his leg which had since brought on paralysis. Soon afterwards
he suffered a further blow in the death of his wife. He lost all
his youthful vigour, which seemed to have run out of him when
he fell off his horse. For twenty-five years he had not set foot
outside his study, had not read anything except the Book of
Rewards and Punishments, nor had anything to do with the
world outside. The conflict between father and son had now
become an inescapable reality for him and his son Sun-fu, and
he now seemed as cantankerous and eccentric to his son as his
father had once seemed to him. His study had been his castle;
his scriptures his coat of mail. For ten years he had stubbornly
refused to make peace with his son.

Now, although he was riding in a motorcar of the latest design,
it did not mean that he was relenting towards his son. On the
contrary, he had repeatedly declared that he would rather die
than see his son living a life completely deviating from the path
of righteousness. He had never really wanted to come to Shang-
hai, nor had his son tried to insist that he should. Lately, how-
ever, local bandits had been very active and in the neighbouring
province the Reds had been gaining ground like a prairie fire.
Wu Sun-fu had thought it no longer safe for his father to remain
in his country home. It was, in fact, an expression of filial
piety. It had never occurred to the old man that bandits or
Reds would harm a pious old man like him, but invalid as he
was, unable to move and unable to sit up or lie down without
help, what else could he do but let them haul him out of his
castle, load him on board a boat, and finally thrust him into
this monster of a motorcar. Just as, twenty-five years ago,
his paralysis had ended his career as a reformist and forced him
to surrender to his vice-minister father, so now this same ac-
cursed infirmity was threatening to cut short his religious life
and force him to stoop to his modern industrialist son. Could
there be no end to his tragedy?

Nevertheless, he still had his Book of Rewards and Punishments
to afford him its precious protection. He had also his two pre-
cious children, his son Ah-hsuan and his daughter Huei-fang,
to be at his side, so that although he was now plunging into
the “sinners’ paradise” of Shanghai, he was strong in the belief
that he could keep himself morally intact. He had closed his
eyes long enough to regain his mental composure and now he
opened them calmly and confidently to look once more at the
world.

The car was racing along like mad. He peered through the
wind-sereen. Good Heavens! the towering skyscrapers, their
countless lighted windows gleaming like the eyes of devils,
seemed to be rushing down on him like an avalanche at one
moment and vanishing at the next. The smooth road stretched
before him, and street-lamps flashed past on either side, spring-
ing up and vanishing in endless succession. A snake-like stream
of black monsters, each with a pair of blinding lights for eyes,
their horns blaring, bore down upon him, nearer and nearer! He
closed his eyes tight in terror, trembling all over. He felt as
if his head were spinning and his eyes swam before a kalei-
doscope of red, yellow, green, black, shiny, square, cylindrical,
leaping, dancing shapes, while his ears rang in a pandemonium
of honking, hooting and jarring, till his heart was in his mouth.

When some time had passed without mishap, the old man
slowly recovered his breath and became conscious of voices
humming about his ears:

“Shanghai is not so peaceful nowadays either, Huei-fang. Last
month the buses went on strike, and now the trams are out.
Not long ago there was a big Communist demonstration in
Peking Road. Hundreds of them were arrested, and one of them
was shot dead on the spot. Some of the Communists were
armed, too! Sun-fu says the factory workers are restless and
might make trouble or riot at any moment. And the walls of
his factory and house have often had Communist slogans chalked
all over them... .”

“Haven't the police ever caught them?”

“They have caught some, but they cannot catch all of them.
Oh, dear! I really don’t know where all these desperate charac-
ters come from. ... But my dear, you do make me laugh with
your get-up. Your dress might have been in fashion ten years
ago but now you're in Shanghai you must follow the fashion.
You must get yourself a new outfit first thing tomorrow morning.”

Old Mr. Wu opened his eyes again and saw that he was sur-
rounded by a sea of little box-like motorcars like the one he
was sitting in, all standing quiet and motionless, while not far
ahead a stream of cars and vehicles of all kinds was rushing
higgledy-piggledy in one direction and another stream the other
way. Among the cars men and women of all sorts and condi-
tions were dashing along as if the devil was on their tail. From
somewhere above a shaft of crimson light fell upon him.

Here, at the crossing of Nanking Road and Honan Road, the
cars going across were being held up by the traffic lights.
“T haven’t met Sun-fu’s wife yet, Fu-fang,” whispered Huei-
fang. “I’m afraid she’ll die laughing when she sees what a
eountrified girl I am.”

She cast a furtive glance at her father, then gazed out at all
the fashionable women sitting in the cars all round them. Fu-
fang giggled, and took out her handkerchief to dab her lips.
A whiff of perfume assailed the old fellow’s nostrils, and it
seemed to upset him.

“YT really can’t get over you, Huei-fang. When I went home
to the country last year, I didn't see any of the country girls
wearing such old-fashioned clothes as yours.”

“That’s true. Even country girls like to look pretty and
smart nowadays. But father won’t let me... .”

All this talk about fashion acted like a needle on the atrophied
nerves of the old man. His heart fluttered, and his eyes fell
instinctively upon Fu-fang and he saw now for the first time
how she was decked out. Though it was still only May, the
weather was unusually warm and she was already in the lightest
of summer clothing. Her vital young body was sheathed in
close-fitting light-blue chiffon, her full, firm breasts jutting out
prominently, her snowy forearms bared. Old Mr. Wu felt his
heart constricting with disgust and quickly averted his eyes,
which, however, fell straight away upon a half-naked young
woman sitting up in a rickshaw, fashionably dressed in a
transparent, sleeveless voile blouse, displaying her bare legs and
thighs. The old man thought for one horrible moment that she
had nothing else on. The text “Of all the vices sexual indul-
gence is the cardinal” drummed on his mind, and he shuddered.
But the worst was yet to come, for he quickly withdrew his
gaze, only to find his youngest son Ah-hsuan gaping with avid
admiration at the same half-naked young woman. The old man
felt his heart pounding wildly as if it would burst, and his throat
burning as if choked with chillies.

The lights changed to green, and the car moved forward in a
motley sea of traffic and humanity. On and on they went, while
the din of the traffic, the stench of petrol-fumes, the women’s
perfume and the glare of neon signs pressed down like a night-
mare on his frail spirit until his eyes blurred, his ears sang and

his head swam; until his over-wrought nerves ached as if they
would snap and his pounding heart could beat no faster.

His breathing became wheezy, but amid the roar of the metrop-
olis neither Fu-fang nor Huei-fang nor Ah-hsuan could hear
it. His face turned ashen, but in the red and green glare no-
body noticed the difference.

The car raced on at top speed. Their lighted windows gleam-
ing through the trees, the flats at the roadside rushed up one
after another and were gone in a flash. The cool evening breeze
set the wind-screen rattling. NHuei-fang drew a sigh of relief as
if a great weight had been lifted from her mind and said to
Ah-hsuan:

“This time we’ve really come to stay in Shanghai, I suppose.
But what is it that’s so attractive about Shanghai that people
keep pouring in? If you ask me, I rather hate the bustle and
noise. It gives me such a headache.”

“You'll like it when you get used to it,” said Fu-fang. “Every-
pody’s running away from the countryside now that the bandits
are on the increase, and settling in Shanghai. Look at these
new houses on either side of the road; they’ve sprung up during
the last two years. No matter how many new houses are built,
there are always people waiting to move in.”

She opened her red handbag, took out a powder-puff, and
began making up her face in the little mirror fixed inside the
bag:

“TI think it’s quite peaceful in the country. Seems there are
less rumours of trouble there. Isn’t that so, Ah-hsuan?”

“Peaceful? I can’t agree. Why, only two weeks ago a com-
pany of troops arrived in our town and demanded that the
Chamber of Commerce should supply them with fifty young
women—to darn and wash for them, they said. When the
Chamber of Commerce said that they couldn’t help them, the
soldiers set out themselves to find them. The fruiterer’s wife
next door was grabbed, don’t you remember? And our maid
didn’t dare set foot outside the house for several days... .”

“But that’s outrageous! Of course, here in Shanghai we never
know what's actually happening down in the country. We have
heard that the Communists kidnap women and communize them.”
“But I’ve never seen a Communist in our parts. Anyway,
that company of soldiers made enough trouble as it is.”

“Oh, Ah-hsuan, what a fool you are!” said Fu-fang with a
sigh. “Of course you’ve never seen a Communist! If you had
done, you wouldn't be here now! Chu-chai says they’re up to
all sorts of tricks now. They’re everywhere. You'll find them
in all walks of lite, and there’s no stopping them. And you
don’t even know they’re there until they strike like a bolt from
the blue.”

Huei-fang shivered inwardly at this, but Ah-hsuan, who did
not quite understand what it was all about, just threw back his
head and laughed. He was immensely tickled by Fu-fang’s
account of the elusive, will-o’-the-wisp Communists. He thought
to himself: So the Communists pounce on you like a bolt from
the blue, do they? Why, that’s magic. He was the baby of the
family and, although now a good-looking lad of nineteen, he
was still rather naive, having always been his father’s blue-
eyed boy.

The chauffeur sounded the horn and the car turned into a
quiet, shady side-street, where the lamplight filtered through
a dense screen of leaves and splashed Fu-fang and the others with
flecks of light. The car began to slow down as it approached
the house. Gathering up her things, Fu-fang turned to her
father and said quietly:

“Father, we're there.”

“He’s asleep.”

“Don't shout so, Ah-hsuan. You know, Fu-fang, while father’s
resting with his eyes closed, he allows no one to disturb him.”

The chauffeur gave three blasts on the horn, holding on to
toots, trailing the last one to announce their presence. The
black iron gate in front of the big foreign-style building imme-
diately swung open, and the car glided into the drive. Ah-hsuan
jumped up from his seat and, looking round, saw that the other
two cars were following behind and that several servants and
an armed policeman were standing by the entrance. Then the
iron gate clanged shut and the cars swished on up the asphalt
drive, through a tunnel of dark, overhanging trees through which
occasional lights twinkled. The car swung sharply and there
in front of them was a large, brightly-lit, three-storeyed build-
ing. The car lurched to a stop amid radio music which floated
through an open window.

A maid’s clear voice announced:

“Madame! Mr. Wu and his father and the others are here.’

Old Mr. Wu, who had only just recovered from his attack of
dizziness, opened his eyes with a start of surprise. The first
things that his returning consciousness seized upon were the
ravenous way his son Ah-hsuan had gazed at the half-naked
woman in the street and his daughter Huei-fang’s voice as she
had complained: “Even country girls like to look pretty and
smart nowadays, but father won’t let me... .”

So his precious children had undergone a change the moment
they had entered the “Sinners’ Paradise”!

*

The radio was switched off, and the sound of women’s laughter
carried through the windows. Then a bustling clickety-clack
of high-heeled shoes was heard as three dark figures loomed up.
One of them proved to be a tallish, svelte young woman in a
pink dress. She hurried up to the first car, her hips swaying
as she walked, pulled open the door and greeted them gaily:

“How did you enjoy your journey, father? Fu-fang, is this
Huei-fang? And Ah-hsuan?”

Old Mr. Wu was immediately enveloped in an overpowering
gust of rich, heady perfume, and through the fragrant haze saw
a round, clear-skinned face beneath an unruly mop of wavy hair,
with bright, sparkling eyes, and startlingly red lips parted in
a ready smile. She tilted her curly head slightly and said in
a tinkling, silvery voice:

“Sun-fu, you and the others go in first. Fu-fang and Pll help
father out of the car. Huei-fang, will you get out first?”

Old Mr. Wu summoned up his last ounce of strength to shake
his head, but nobody noticed it. Huei-fang stepped out brush-
ing against the wavy hair of the young lady. Fu-fang put her
right arm under the old man’s left arm to support him while
Ah-hsuan also lent a hand. Thus he was propelled out of the
car willy-nilly and passed to the wavy-haired lady, whose smooth
arm immediately encircled his waist. In a swirl of enticing
laughter and overwhelmingly fragrant scent, Old Mr. Wu could
only shudder and clutch against his breast the Book of Rewards

and Punishments. A thought flashed through his tortured mind:
“They must be demons or evil spirits, these people!”

Extreme disgust and anger seemed to infuse the old man with
unwonted strength, which enabled him to mount the stone steps
quite easily on the arms of his daughter and daughter-in-law.
The big drawing-room was flooded with light and filled with
people. When Old Mr. Wu stepped into the room, he was met
by his son and son-in-law. Then two wavy-haired young girls
rushed up to him. They asked him how he was and, laughing
and chattering, hustled him into a high-backed armchair.

The old man looked around him, his wide eyes burning with
disgust, anger and excitement, and his face purpling. He saw
the room whirling with lights and colours, whirling more and
more swiftly. Near by him a queer-looking, round and shiny
thing stood on a small table whirring and turning from side to
side, making a wind which took his breath away, like a golden-
faced witch swaying her head and casting a spell over him. And
the more this golden, flashing disc swayed, the bigger it became,
until it filled the whole room, until it filled all space. All the
red and green lights, all the geometrical shapes of the furniture
and all the men and women were dancing and spinning together,
bathed in the golden light. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu in pink, a girl in
apple-green, and another in light yellow were frantically leaping
and whirling around him. Their light silk dresses barely con-
cealed their curves, their full, pink-tipped breasts and the shadow
under their arms. The room was filled with countless swelling
bosoms, bosoms that bobbed and quivered and danced around
him. Wu Sun-fu’s pimply face grinned and Ah-hsuan’s lustful
eyes shone among the dancing breasts. Suddenly, all these
quivering, dancing breasts swept at Old Mr. Wu like a hail of
arrows, piling up on his chest and smothering him, piling up on
the Book of Rewards and Punishments on his lap. He heard
wild, seductive laughter and the room rocked and swayed as if
it would collapse.

“Devils,” cried Old Mr. Wu, as golden sparks showered before
his eyes. He felt his chest crushed under an enormous weight,
and something seemed to explode inside his head. Suddenly
there sprang out of the ground before him two women, Mrs. Wu
Sun-fu and the girl in apple-green, both laughing with wide-

open, blood-red mouths as though they wanted to swallow him.
Something seemed to snap in his head. He turned up his eyes,
and knew no more.

“Uncle, don’t you recognize me? I’m Su-su, Chang Su-su,’
the girl in apple-green Grafton silk asked him and giggled, while
Mrs. Wu Sun-fu let out a startled scream and dropped the cup
of tea which she was holding out for the old man. All the
other people in the room started up in surprise. For a brief
moment you could have heard a pin drop; then there was a
rush of feet, and they thronged round Old Mr. Wu, all shouting
and asking questions at once. He looked deathly pale, his head
drooping to the side and his mouth frothing. The Book of
Rewards and Punishments fell to the floor with a heavy thud.

“Pather! What’s the matter with you? Wake up! Wake up!”
cried Mrs. Tu in a trembling voice, holding her father’s head in
her hands, while Tu Chu-chai, her husband, peered round her
shoulder, frightened out of his wits.

Wu Sun-fu was gripping his father’s hand. When he saw
many servants pressing round, he flared up:

“Get out of the way, all of you. Hurry up and fetch an ice-
bag.”

“An ice-bag! Get an ice-bag!” the servants shouted as they
scrambled out of the room to find one. “Old Mr. Wu's having
a stroke!’ The girl in light yellow grasped Chang Su-su’s hand
and asked:

“Su-su, what happened? You saw the old man faint away,
didn’t you?”

Chang Su-su stood speechless, her eyes staring and her chest
rising and falling. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu gasped:

?

“T was holding out a cup of tea for father ...I saw, I saw
him ...saw his head drooping... his eyes closing ... his
mouth foaming... his face turning pale. Is it a stroke? Or

asthma? Huei-fang, has father ever had attacks like this before?”
Fu-fang was pinching her father’s upper lip. Huei-fang was
standing in a daze with tears trickling down her cheeks. Fu-
fang repeated Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s question:
“Huei-fang, has father ever had attacks like this before? Has
he? Come on, you must tell me.”

“If it’s an attack of phlegm, it isn’t serious if only he can
cough. After a cough or two, he’ll come to.”

This diagnosis came from Tu Chu-chai. He glanced at Wu
Sun-fu, fumbled nervously for his snuff-box and gave it to him.
Wu Sun-fu took it, then turned on the servants furiously: ‘There
are too many people crowding round. The heat of your bodies

alone’s enough to suffocate the old man.... Where’s that ice-
bag got to?... Pei-yao, we don’t need you here for the time
being: go and ring up Dr. Ting ... Wang Mah, you run and

get an ice-bag.” He turned to Fu-fang: “Don’t worry, Fu-fang.
Father’s heart is still beating. But we shouldn’t leave him sit-
ting in this chair. Let’s carry him over to the couch.” He im-
mediately put his arms round the old man to pick him up, and
then the others came and lent him a hand. By the time Old
Mr, Wu was lying on the velvet-cushioned couch, Mrs. Wu Sun-
fu came back from the telephone to tell them that the doctor
would be over in ten minutes and that in the meantime he
should lie undisturbed in a quiet room. The maid brought in
an ice-bag, and Wu Sun-fu quickly laid it on the old man’s fore-
head. He shouted to another servant, who was standing in the
doorway:

“Go and call two or three men to carry Old Mr. Wu into the
small drawing-room. The doctor will be here any moment, s0
tell the porter to look out for him.”

Suddenly the old man’s hand twitched. He made a noise in
his throat and a frothy mucus oozed out of his mouth. “Oh,
good!” several voices exclaimed with some relief. Young Mrs.
Wu pulled a white handkerchief from Chang Su-su’s lapel and
wiped the old man’s lips with it. She cast a worried glance at
her husband, who frowned. Fu-fang and Tu Chu-chai also looked
worried. The blue veins on the old man’s forehead now stood
out like worms, the rasping in his throat became louder and
quicker and the froth still oozed from his lips. Suddenly, his
hand twitched again, and his eyelids fluttered a moment and then
remained half closed.

“Oh! what’s keeping Dr. Ting? Let’s carry father into the
other room now,” muttered Wu Sun-fu, wringing his hands with
impatience. He motioned to the four servants standing by to
lift the couch on which the old man was lying and carry it

into the small drawing-room. He followed behind with his wife,
Tu Chu-chai, Fu-fang, and Huei-fang. Ah-hsuan, who had been
standing by gaping, came to, looked round in alarm, scampered
into the parlour, and slammed the door behind him.

*

An uneasy silence fell upon the people left in the large
drawing-room. Chang Su-su, leaning against a big, luxurious
radio-cabinet, was gazing pensively at the Book of Rewards and
Punishments lying on the floor. Two young men were sitting
on a sofa, resting their heads on their hands, drawing slowly
at cigarettes and from time to time glancing nervously towards
the door of the other room.

The room was still softly lit and the golden disc of the electric
fan continued to whir and turn slowly from side to side, sending
a cool breeze over everybody and ruffling their clothes. These
people, who had hitherto been used to comfort and pleasure,
now felt a vague uneasiness.

The girl in light-yellow silk was sitting by the piano, idly turn-
ing the pages of a score. She bore a striking resemblance to
Mrs. Wu Sun-fu and was, in fact, her younger sister, Lin Pei-shan.

Chang Su-su, who had been lost in thought, suddenly came to
as if she had an idea. She looked up sharply and glanced round
for somebody to speak to. Catching the eye of Lin Pei-shan,
she ran over to her, struck her palms together, and whispered
earnestly in an undertone:

“Pei-shan, I'm afraid it’s all over with Old Mr. Wu! I've seen
people—”

Hearing this, the two young men on the sofa jumped to their
feet in surprise and looked at Chang Su-su with questioning eyes.

“How can you be so sure about it?” asked Lin Pei-shan hes-
itantly, standing up.

“How can I be sure? Well, this is not the first time I’ve seen
somebody die!”

Several servants had gathered around Chang Su-su and when
they heard her say this, they could not help bursting out laugh-
ing; but Chang Su-su kept a straight face. She lowered her voice
and went on mysteriously:

“Do you think it was phlegm he was oozing out? Oh no!
Not at all! He was foaming at the mouth. When people die in

hot weather, they usually foam at the mouth just as he did.
I know: I’ve seen it. And wouldn’t you call today hot? Eighty
degrees, although it’s only the sixteenth of May. Am I right,
Yu-ting? Go on!”

Chang Su-su turned and looked at one of the two men as
much as to say that he should nod his head to bear her out.
The man, Li Yu-ting, was of medium height, had a sharply
pointed face and wore thick-lensed glasses. He neither agreed
nor disagreed with her, but merely smiled cryptically, which
did not please her at all. She glanced at him resentfully, pursed
her little scarlet lips and muttered crossly:

“I shan’t forget this in a hurry! Teachers usually are pretty
spineless, but you university professors are even worse. Your
students don't hesitate to speak their mind, but you professors
keep to the middle of the road. Then you have to take all the
knocks and grin sheepishly. But we aren’t in class now, Pro-
fessor Li: we are in Mr. Wu's!”

Li Yu-ting stopped smiling and looked considerably chastened.
The other man, Fan Po-wen, who was standing behind Lin Pei-
shan, whispered something to her which made her snigger and
flash an amused glance at Chang Su-su. The latter crimsoned,
swung round. bore down on Lin Pei-shan, and said with mock
annoyance: “What mischief are you two up to? Saying things
behind my back, are you? Come on, say you’re sorry.”

Lin Pei-shan edged away, giggling and protecting herself with
her hands in case Chang Su-su should tickle her, and appealed
to the young man:

“Po-wen, you started the trouble; how can you just stand
there and watch?”

Just then they heard the sound of a horn and a car drew up
outside. A tall middle-aged man in foreign dress hurried in,
followed by two nurses in white uniforms, one of them carry-
ing a bulging Gladstone bag. Chang Su-su let go of Lin Pei-shan
and rose to greet the man:

“How do you do, Dr. Ting? The patient's in the small drawing-
room.”

So saying, she tripped across to the door of the other room
and opened it noiselessly for the doctor and nurses, then slipped
in herself, closing it behind her.

Smoothing her tousled hair, Lin Pei-shan said to her cousin:

“Did you see how the doctor’s car raced up to the door? Just
like a fire-engine.”

“Ah, but his job is to kindle a spark of life in the old man,
not to put it out!”

“There you go again: poetry! Huh!”

Lin Pei-shan cast a saucy glance at Fan Po-wen and moved
towards the door of the other room. The door opened and Chang
Su-su tiptoed out. Then a nurse appeared in the doorway, mo-
tioned a servant to come over, and handed him an enamel basin
for some water. She withdrew behind the door and closed it.

Everybody looked at Chang Su-su inquiringly. She gave a
slight shake of her head and without a word walked glumly
round a rosewood table. She stopped in front of Lin Pei-shan
and the others and said quietly:

“Dr. Ting says it’s cerebral haemorrhage and puts it down to
over-excitement. He can’t say yet whether he’s going to live or
not. Fancy it being over-excitement, though!”

They exchanged glances in silence. “Fancy that!’ echoed Li
Yu-ting lamely after a moment, as if trying to make up for
upsetting Chang Su-su.

“Yet to my mind it doesn’t really seem as strange as all that.
It would be quite natural for Old Mr. Wu to become over-excited.
Just think what it’s been like for him living quietly down in the
country. He hasn't set foot outside the house for the last twenty
years or so. It’s been nothing short of a living grave, that study
of his that he’s been cooped up in all this time. And now today
he’s suddenly been rushed off to Shanghai, where he sees and
hears and smells so many strange, new things which cannot but
over-excite him. He's getting on in years and his health isn’t
all that good; it would be strange if he didn’t have an attack
of cerebral haemorrhage.”

Fan Po-wen spoke slowly with a feminine lilt in his voice,
and his face beamed smugly. He sought Lin Pei-shan’s eye, and
she returned him a wry smile. Chang Su-su saw this. She de-
liberately kept a straight face and snorted:

“Poet laureate! You’re even poetizing on someone’s death
now!”

“I may have chosen an unfortunate subject, Miss Chang, but
I don’t think I deserve such a dressing down.”

“All right, then: would you rather it was your Lin Pei-shan
telling you off?”

This time it was Lin Pei-shan’s turn to blush. She snorted
and walked off in a huff, followed by Fan Po-wen. Chang Su-
su knitted her brows in a worried frown and paced round the
rosewood table once more, while Li Yu-ting just stood there
rubbing his chin. An oppressive silence fell on the room, broken
only by the monotonous whir of the electric fan and the occa-
sional hoot of a car in the street, though even these sounded
dull and drowsy. A few servants stood motionless in the door-
way, and Wang Mah and another maid were whispering with
their heads together, their lips moving silently.

The door of the small drawing-room opened and the tall figure
of Dr. Ting emerged. He took a cigar from a silver case on an
oval brass table, lit up, and sank into an armchair.

“How is he?” asked Chang Su-su softly, going across to him.

“He’s in a pretty bad way. I’ve just given him another in-
jection.”

“Don’t you think he’ll last the night?”

“There’s no doubt about it!”

*

Dr. Ting discarded his cigar and went back into the other
room. Chang Su-su went softly across to the door and pulled
it up behind him. She wheeled round, ran back to Lin Pei-shan,
threw her arms around her waist, and pressed her face against
hers. Stamping her feet, she whimpered:

“Oh, Pei-shan! I do feel upset! I can’t bear to think about
people dying, and dying so suddenly. I don’t want to die—I
won’t die!”

“But we all have to go one day.”

“No, not me! Pei-shan, I won’t die!”

“Perhaps you're different from everyone else: when you get
old, you can slough your skin like a snake and be young again!

Anyway, don’t keep pawing me so. Look what a mess
you’re making of my hair! Oh, leave go of me, do!”

“Never mind. You can go to the beauty parlour again tomor-
row. Listen, Pei-shan: if I must die, I'd rather die of over-
excitement.”

Lin Pei-shan started in surprise and looked into Chang Su-su's
eyes, which were shining with an unusual excitement which she
had never seen there before.

“To die of excitement! Yes, I think that would perhaps be
the nicest way to die. But the sort of excitement I want is not
the sort the old man had today. No, what I want is the excite-
ment of some great upheaval like a storm, a volcanic eruption,
an earthquake, or to see the whole universe in chaos. Ah...
that would be wonderful, magnificent!”

After this outburst, Chang Su-su let go of Lin Pei-shan, stepped
back, sank into a rocking-chair, and buried her face in her hands.

Li Yu-ting and Fan Po-wen, who had been standing by listen-
ing, broke into a laugh. It seemed that the way Chang Su-su
had struck out and then retreated amused them greatly. Seeing
that Lin Pei-shan was still standing there absorbed in her own
thoughts, Fan Po-wen went over and took her hand. She started
at the touch but, when she saw it was Fan Po-wen, gave him
an arch look. He jerked his thumb in the direction of Chang
Su-su and whispered:

“Now you can see what’s wrong with Su-su. She is very much
in need of excitement, but that dreary professor has none to
offer. Anyway, what she just said shows she’s got some poetic
talent, I think.”

Lin Pei-shan smiled at first, but, when she heard his last re-
mark, she gave him an icy glare, snorted, and moved languidly
away. Realizing that she had misunderstood him, he ran after
her and caught her by the shoulder, but she angrily shrugged
fiis hand off, ran through the back door, and slammed it in his
face. He hesitated for a second, then dashed over, flung open
the door and shouted, “Pei-shan!”

The slam startled Chang Su-su out of her reverie. She looked
up, then dropped her eyes again. Her gaze fell on the Book of
Rewards and Punishments in its yellow damask case lying on a
low rectangular table before her, picked it up, and began turning
over the pages of neat characters written on high-grade Chinese
paper. She paused at an epilogue by Old Mr. Wu, which read:

I have had a hundred thousand copies of the Book of
Rewards and Punishments reprinted for distribution among
my fellow-believers, and also transcribed the whole text with
my own hand....

Chang Su-su burst out laughing and was about to read on
when somebody spoke to her from behind:

“Now there was a man who may truly be said to have had a
faith and to have been loyal to it all his life.”

It was Li Yu-ting, leaning over the back of the chair, a cigarette
between his fingers. Chang Su-su glanced at him over her
shoulder, then looked down again at the book. After a while,
she laid the book on her lap and asked abruptly:

“Tell me, Yu-ting: what sort of a society are we living in?”

Li Yu-ting was taken aback by this unexpected question, but,
being a professor of economics, he did not find it difficult to say
something:

“It’s a tall order, your question. But you can find an answer
in the next room. There you have a successful financier and a
captain of industry. That little drawing-room is Chinese society
in miniature.”

“But there’s also a pious old man—a believer in the Book of
Rewards and Punishments.”

“Yes, put the old man is—he’s dying fast.”

“But in our country there are heaven knows how many more
like him.”

“Never mind. They'll die directly they arrive in Shanghai.
Shanghai is... .”

Li Yu-ting broke off when the door from the next room opened
and Mrs. Wu Sun-fu came out. Except for a slight frown this
beautiful young woman was as lively as ever. When she saw
that Li Yu-ting and Chang Su-su were alone together here, she
shot them a surprised glance, but immediately changed it to a
hospitable smile. She called for the butler Kao Sheng and the
maid Wang Mah. When they came in, she said:

“It seems the old master cannot be expected to last the night
out. Kao Sheng, you telephone to the factory for Mr. Mo Kan-
cheng to come round at once. Then draw up a list of relatives
and friends of the family to be notified when he passes away.
And have your men tidy up the garden and everywhere and get

the spare chairs and tables out of the attic. If you’re short-
handed, go and get some helpers from Mr. Tu Chu-chai’s place.
Now, Wang Mah, you take some maids to tidy up the guest-
rooms on the second floor and change all the net curtains, table-
cloths and loose covers.”

“What about a shroud for the old master? And what kind of
wood —?”

“you needn’t bother about that. Anyway, it hasn’t been de-
cided yet. We shall probably call in the International Under-
takers. You just tell Mr. Mo Kan-cheng to bring with him as
many men from the factory as he can spare.”

“By the way, the Tai Sheng Chang Shipping Company’s just
sent over the old master’s luggage, twenty-eight pieces all told.”

“All right, Wang Mah, you go and check them, and anything
that isn't needed for the time being you can put in the attic.”

Hearing someone in the next room call her name, Mrs. Wu
Sun-fu hurried back to the small drawing-room. Before clos-
ing the door behind her, she stuck out her head and asked:

“Su-su, do you know where Pei-shan and Po-wen have vanished
to? Will you fetch them for me, please?”

Chang Su-su nodded but did not move. She was still reflect-
ing on her discussion with Li Yu-ting and was thinking of pick-
ing up the thread where they had left off. Li Yu-ting was
pacing up and down and drawing on his cigarette in silence.
By now it was nine o’clock, and out in the garden people were
coming and going and bustling about. The lights among the
trees, in the summerhouses and on the rockeries were switched
on. Wang Mah led several stout women servants into the large
drawing-room, where they began changing the crimson net cur-
tains for white ones. There was a large bundle of loose covers
on the floor, and even the carpets were taken out to be beaten.

There was a scuffle from the next room, and suddenly there
came the sound of sobbing voices and cries of “Father!” Chang
Su-su and Li Yu-ting looked tense. She rose and walked ner-
vously up and down, then ran across the room and pushed open
the door. As the door opened, the big room was filled with the
sound of sobbing. Dr. Ting came out, rubbing his hands together,
and said to Li Yu-ting, “It’s all over.”

Wu Sun-fu followed him out, his face gloomy. He told the
servants to ring up Mr. Chiu Chun, a lawyer, and ask him to
come round. He turned to Li Yu-ting:

“Yu-ting, I hope you can stay with us tonight and give us a
hand. It’s now gone nine and the newspapers may not be will-
ing to accept our obituary notice as late as this, but it must
appear tomorrow morning without fail, so I wonder if you’d be
good enough to go and arrange it? Chu-chai is wording it now.
It’s to go to all the five leading papers, of course.” He turned
to the butler: “Kao Sheng! Why isn’t Mr. Mo Kan-cheng here
yet?”

The servant, who was standing on the steps outside, was just
going to answer, when Fu-fang ran out and seized Wu Sun-fu
by the arm and said:

“I’ve just talked things over with Pei-yao about the shrouding
and we think we'd best put it off until the day after tomorrow
in the morning. We need a little time for the preparation and,
besides, we'd better wait until Uncle Tseng Tsang-hai has ar-
rived. We can't afford to slight him: you know what a fuss he
makes.”

Wu Sun-fu paused for a moment and then said firmly:

“We'll send him a telegram tonight. He may or may not
arrive in time for the shrouding, but we can’t put it off simply
because of him. If he complains of anything, I'll answer for it.
The shrouding takes place at two o’clock tomorrow afternoon,
come what may.”

Fu-fang would have liked to say something more, but he had
already rushed back to the next room. Fu-fang eventually
followed him in.

Just then, Lin Pei-shan and Fan Po-wen, hand in hand, came
out of the dining-room into the right-hand corner of the big
room. They were taken aback at the din and bustle. Lin Pei-
shan said:

“Tt looks as if the old man's gone.”

“If so, I’m not in the least surprised. When he lived in the
country he existed like a mummy. The country was his grave,
in which he couldn’t decompose easily. In this modern city of
Shanghai he has done. He’s gone, and good riddance. One
mummy of old China the less. Old China herself is a mummy

five thousand years old, and she’s decomposing fast. She can’t
weather the storm of this new age much longer.”

Lin Pei-shan smiled wryly, and threw Fan Po-wen a sly glance
of pretended vexation.
II

ABOUT five o’clock next morning there were a few drops of
rain in the wind. It was much cooler than the evening before —a
drop of nearly ten degrees — but by nine o’clock the sun, now
blazing high in the sky, had dispersed the lowering clouds and
the temperature was up again to eighty degrees. One felt the
menace of an even severer heat-wave.

The ushers at the Wus’ residence, holding aloft white card-
board signs indicating their function and wearing coarse black
gowns tied at the waist with long, wide strips of thick white
cloth for belts, scurried to and fro in the scorching sun, from the
main gate to the large drawing-room which was being used as
a “ceremonial hall,’ and then back again to the main gate to
escort in more newly-arrived mourners. Every one of them was
tired and perspiring freely. Until half past ten, the eight of
them now and then managed to snatch a moment's rest on the
wooden benches beside the funeral musicians at the main gate,
where they would mop their brows with the loose ends of their
white belts and fan themselves with the cardboard signs while
they regained their breath, grumbling because Mr. Wu Sun-fu
had not employed more men to do this job. By midday, how-
ever, when the sun was beating down mercilessly on their heads,
the visitors had begun to arrive in an endless stream, and the
two bands, one at the main gate and one before the hall, were
both playing non-stop. The ushers rushed back and forth like
robots, too busy now even to think of grumbling about Mr. Wu.
They could at most cast envious glances at the six masters of
ceremonies who were standing idly before the funeral hall.

The hooting of cars... the funeral din of flutes, trumpets
and gongs ... the bawling of waiters as they elbowed their way
back and forth with shouts of “Tea here!” and “Lemonade for

this gentleman!” ... the noise of chauffeurs and rickshaw boys
clamouring for tips ... the raised voices of policemen and plain-
clothes men shooing idle onlookers away from the main gate...
the acrid smell of cigarette smoke and the odour of human
bodies — all mingled together and penetrated every corner of
the Wu mansion and its acre and a half of garden.

The dining-room next to the funeral hall was packed with
people. A huge mahogany sideboard stood across it like a bridge,
partitioning it into two sections. In the right-hand wall of
the interior section were windows looking out on to the garden;
close to the windows stood a tall trellis covered with banksia
roses, which afforded fragrance and shade to the whole room.
In the left wall there were two doors, one of which opened on
to a veranda on which guests were sitting clustered around tea-
tables, holding forth noisily on “gold bullion,” “silver bars,”
“cotton yarn,” and “taels and cents,” their talk punctuated by
the pfft! of lemonade bottles being opened. Close by a door at
the extreme end of the veranda sat a man of about thirty in
a khaki uniform and long riding-boots, with three or four enamel
badges on his chest. He was sitting alone in a rocking-chair,
slowly sipping lemonade and glancing every so often at the door
beside him. It was closed, but whenever it opened an inch or
two an intoxicating perfume and silvery laughter escaped through
the crack.

Suddenly the man in uniform put down his glass and stood
up, his spurs jingling, and sprang to attention, then made a low
bow to a woman appearing in the doorway.

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu was rather taken aback by this unexpected
show of courtesy, but by the time he had straightened up she
had recovered her composure and nodded with a smile.

“Ah, Colonel Lei! You here? ... Nice of you to come.”

“Oh, don’t mention it. I was planning to come tomorrow to
say goodbye, but when I heard that this had happened, I felt I
had to come to pay my last respects. They tell me Old Mr. Wu
passed away yesterday evening. If so, Madame, you must have
had quite a time of it!” replied Col. Lei, smiling respectfully, at
the same time glancing over Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s mourning dress:
an ankle-length black gauze dress with tight-fitting three-quarter
length sleeves discreetly flattering her tall, elegant figure. She

wore no make-up. Beneath her fine arched brows, her eyes,
though just a little red from crying, were still as bright as they
always had been, dancing and shining with infinite wisdom and
boundless charm. The colonel’s heart fluttered. This was the
first time he had seen this lovely creature as “Madame Wu.”
Deep in his heart lingered the memory of another lovely creature
of five years ago, when she was not yet “Madame Wu” but just
“Miss Lin Pei-yao” and her image suddenly rose before his eyes
again and tugged mercilessly at his heartstrings. The reappear-
ance of this ghost from the past — and at such a moment as this —
seemed so cruel. Without waiting for her reply, he compressed
his lips, made another bow, and left hurriedly. He made his
way through the babel of voices holding forth on “gold” and
“cotton yarn,” and into the inner half of the dining-room.

*

As soon as he stepped into the room, he was hailed by two
voices simultaneously:

“Look, here’s Colonel Lei! You're just in time to help us out.”

This simultaneous appeal to a third party worked like a charm
and the voices which had been raised in argument suddenly sub-
sided. All eyes turned to Col. Lei as he stood in the doorway,
causing the vision of Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s simple beauty to vanish
from his mind. He smiled and let his eyes travel over the faces
turned towards him, then swung his right hand up in a salute
and cut it sharply away. He walked over to the group, clapped
a short, fat man on the shoulder and grasped a hand held out
to him, and said heartily:

“Not talking about gold and cotton yarn and the prices again,
are you? Quite beyond me, all that sort of thing.” The short,
fat man raised his eyebrows in mock incredulity and laughed,
but before he had a chance to say anything, the youngster who
had shaken hands with the colonel broke in with:

“Gold and cotton yarn? No, nothing like that—and not the
subjects you are an expert in, either, like the foxtrot or the tango
or the ‘Rio Rita’ songs. No, we're discussing the military situa-
tion. Come on and sit down with us.”

“I know you, Huang Fen: you’ve never got a good word to
say for it,” said Col. Lei frowning in feigned protest and squeezed
in on the sofa beside Huang Fen, who was in European dress.

The two had been fellow-cadets at the Whampoa Military
Academy and after graduation had been in action together. They
were on fairly good terms, but the things in which Col. Lei
was interested and at which he excelled were a closed book to
Huang Fen; conversely, whenever the conversation came round
to Huang Fen’s “work,” on which he was so keen, Col. Lei,
although he could be trusted to respect the other’s confidences,
always shook his head. Just lately the two of them had seen
each other almost every day, but every time they met they
quarrelled. Seeing that Huang Fen was in one of his provocative
moods again with all these people present, Col. Lei felt ill at ease.
He would have liked to escape but he could not just walk out on
him.

There was a brief spell of modest silence as if, before the
newcomer, nobody was in a hurry to express his opinion now.
Meanwhile, the gathering in the other half of the dining-room
broke into peals of laughter and someone shouted: “Serve
him right! ... Give him what for!” The voice sounded rather
familiar to Col. Lei. He looked to see who it was, but his view
was blocked by the short, fat man and another man with a small
head perched on a slender neck, sitting with their backs to the
huge sideboard at a square table cluttered up with lemonade
bottles and fruit-dishes. When the short, fat man saw that the
colonel was looking at his companion, he thought that the colonel
probably wanted to get to know him, so he quickly rose and
said:

“Let me introduce my friend to you, Colonel Lei: Mr. Sun
Chi-jen, manager of the Pacific Steamship Company.”

The colonel smiled and nodded to Sun Chi-jen, who produced
a card. Col. Lei gave it a cursory glance and said:

“Oh, I see, Mr. Sun, you’re also running a long-distance bus
service in northern Anhwei. Congratulations on your possessing
the means of both land and water transportation!”

“Quite so,” chimed in the short, fat man, before Sun Chi-jen
could reply. “Mr, Sun’s a man of energy and vision. Unfor-
tunately, that part of Anhwei is at present involved in the war,
and consequently Mr. Sun’s business has had to be temporarily
suspended. ... But tell us, Colonel Lei, how is the war really
going just lately?”

He had a reputation for engineering friendships between stran-
gers and was a skilful flatterer. He was nicknamed “Red-tipped
Match”—not only because he owned the Kwang Tah Match
Factory, but also because he had the knack of kindling the flame
of friendship. His real name—Chou Chung-wei—was therefore
eclipsed in a way by this nickname.

No sooner were the words out of his mouth than several other
voices chorused:

“Yes, tell us what really is going on.”

Col. Lei smiled slightly and answered vaguely:

“More or less what you read in the papers.”

“The papers keep telling us the Central Army is winning, but
according to the rumours going round the town things aren't
going so well, And if the papers don’t give reliable information,
their readers get all the more panicky,” a man in his forties
with a drooping moustache observed in a ringing voice. Col. Lei
recognized him as Wang Ho-fu, general manager of the Ta Hsing
Coal-mining Company. They had met once in a county in Honan,
where the colonel was commanding a regiment.

Everybody nodded agreement with Wang Ho-fu’s observation.
Sun Chi-jen spoke next, wagging his head on his long neck:

“Perhaps the rumours are exaggerated, but there’s no end of
wounded coming in just now. One of our boats called at Pukow
the day before yesterday and was immediately commandeered
to move over a thousand wounded to Changchow, Wusih, and
some other places along the railway. According to some of the
wounded, things are in a pretty bad way.”

“And the Japanese papers say that a certain important man
from the South has reached an understanding with a certain
important man from the North and that he’ll soon stage a
coup d’etat,” put in a man named Chu Yin-chiu, the owner of a
silk factory, sitting opposite Sun Chi-jen. As he said this, he
cast a malicious glance at Col. Lei and at the same time nudged
his neighbour, a thin man of about forty named Chen Chun-yi,
the owner of the Wu Yun Silk Goods Factory, but the latter
just smiled.

Col. Lei was not conscious of the malicious look in Chu Yin-
chiu’s eyes, nor did he notice the quick exchange of knowing
glances between Chu and Chen; nevertheless he felt rather

uneasy. As an officer on the active list, he was naturally embar-
rassed at such a conversation, especially with the indiscreet
Huang Fen at his side. After a moment’s hesitation he said
to Sun Chi-jen:

“J see, one of your boats was used to move more than a
thousand wounded, eh? Yes, well, there have been quite a
lot of casualties just lately. But it only means our troops are
doing a real job at the front. And sacrifices are inevitable
when there’s any serious fighting. But don’t forget the enemy
is being hit even harder. Huang Fen, don’t you remember when
we were fighting along the Peking-Hankow Railway in 727? The
casualties among our 4th and 11th Armies were well over twenty
thousand and you saw nothing but wounded men in Hankow
and Wuchang. But we won in the end, didn’t we?”

By this time he was slightly flushed, and he glanced round
at his listeners to see what effect his words had produced. He
was now eager to change the subject but Huang Fen jumped in
with a sarcastic smile and asked pointedly:

“Did you mention the battle of ’27 along the Peking-Hankow
Railway? That was altogether different from what’s happening
now. The casualties were heavy then because our men fought
and died with a will. But, today, I’m sure it’s quite a different
story, eh?”

The colonel’s face suddenly blanched, as if a shell had fallen
beside him. He stood up, looked all round, sat down again, and
managed to cover his nervousness with a smile:

“My dear fellow, don’t talk such nonsense!”

“Nonsense, is it? It’s the truth, and you know it is. Otherwise,
why are you still back here, and not at the front?”

“I'm leaving for the front the day after tomorrow,” Col. Lei
answered loudly with a triumphant smile. This heroic declara-
tion of his greatly moved his listeners, and was even heard by
people in the front half of the room. There was a sudden
silence, and several people came round from the other side. They
hadn’t quite heard what it was all about; they only saw Chou
Chung-wei, the “Red-tipped Match,” his face wreathed in smiles
and his hand on the colonel’s shoulder, saying to Sun Chi-jen:

“Mr. Sun, I suggest that we give Col. Lei a send-off tomorrow
evening. Do you agree?”

Before Sun Chi-jen could answer, Wang Ho-fu chimed in:

“Col. Lei’s an old friend of mine, so let it be on me... or,
if you insist, we can split it three ways.”

Then the group split up. Chou Chung-wei, Sun Chi-jen, Wang
Ho-fu and three other men sat at a square table, centred round
Col. Lei and exchanging compliments and commonplace polite-
nesses. The other group consisted of Chu Yin-chiu, Chen Chun-
yi and several others with Huang Fen in their centre, were
clustered under the windows on the right-hand side of the room,
most of them standing, still discussing the military situation.
The few people who had come across from the front half of
the room joined this group. Huang Fen spoke loudly and un-
reservedly to one of the newcomers, a man by the name of
Tang Yun-shan:

“Yun-shan, do you know what? Col. Lei is going to the front!
That proves that they’re hard pressed there; otherwise they
wouldn’t have posted him.”

“You’re telling me! A few days ago the New First Division,
a crack division, was practically wiped out in a battle at Yachi-
kang. Trained by German officers, and with the most up-to-
date German equipment, they still didn’t have a chance against
the daredevils of Feng Yu-hsiang’s Northwestern Army. ... But
what’s the colonel going to do at the front? Just be a staff
officer?”

“They'll probably give him a brigade, as so many brigade com-
manders and regiment commanders have been killed in action—
at least half a dozen of them so far.”

“They say,” broke in Chu Yin-chiu, “that an army commander
has been killed and another high-ranking officer wounded. Is
that true, do you know?” Tang Yun-shan laughed, glancing at
Huang Fen as much as to say: You see how news gets around!
Before his chuckle had died away somebody added:

“No, the army commander hasn't been killed. He’s seriously
wounded. Someone has seen him in the French Hospital on Route
Pere Robert.”

Chen Chun-yi, as if afraid that his listeners might not readily
credit his statement, said this in a categorical tone of voice and
also appealed to a tall, hefty man, Dr. Ting, to bear him cut:

“Dr, Ting, I’m sure you can confirm that what I just said is
not just a rumour. I understand Dr. Po of the French Hospital
was a fellow-student of yours. You must have heard about it
from him?”

All eyes now turned to Dr. Ting. At first he seemed not
to understand what it was all about and why Chen Chun-yi was
bringing him into it. Then he smiled as if he had just understood
and said with deliberation:

“You’re right, lots of officers have been wounded. In my pro-
fession I have to know the difference between different kinds of
wounds—bullet wounds, bayonet wounds, shrapnel wounds, and
so forth. But when it comes to commanders of armies or
brigades or regiments I don’t know one from the other. In the
eyes of the surgeon, there’s no difference between the wounds of
army commanders and the wounds of common soldiers: I just
deal with them as they come, and I’ve no idea who is an army
commander or even if there are any.”

His attentive audience laughed and then fell silent, as if not
satisfied with this answer and Chen Chun-yi shook his head in
disappointment. Then a babel of argument broke out again.
Suddenly, someone dashed over from the other side—a young
man wearing a flannel suit and with his hair sleeked back. He
hurriedly squeezed into the doctor's group, where his keen eyes
singled out a middle-aged man in a pale-blue silk gown and with
a toothbrush moustache. He clapped him on the shoulder and
cried excitedly:

“Hey! Chuang-fei, government bonds are dropping again! What
are you going to do with your hundred thousand Army Disband-
ments? There are rumours flying about and everybody’s expect-
ing prices to drop even further.”

This was even more alarming than the news from the front.
Li Chuang-fei, the man with the toothbrush moustache, turned
deathly pale. Chou Chung-wei, Col. Lei and the rest of their
group hurried over to find out just what was happening. This
was an age of speculation. How could anybody with any sum
of money resist dabbling in government bonds? People reacted
differently to the news of slump. The bears were jubilant and
grinned from ear to ear, while the bulls tried hard to swallow
their disappointment.

“Government bonds down again! Limit reached and trading
closed!” somebody shouted through the door to the people on the
veranda, and immediately there was a rush into the dining-room
of those who had been expatiating on “gold” and “cotton yarn.”
With staring eyes and craning their necks, they peered and
jostled back and forth, all shouting at once and demanding:

“Is it Tariff going down?”

“Army Reorganization, did you say?”

“Army Disbandment?”

The five or six people who had remained in the front section
of the dining-room were also attracted by this sudden turmoil
over government bonds, but kept their distance and just looked
on. Among them were Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-sheng, a
sociology student and a distant relative of Wu Sun fu. Fan Po-
wen narrowed one eye and muttered:

“Oh, speculation fever, speculation fever! And you, deluge of
gold, may you overflow, overflow and smash through your
dikes! .. .”

He gave Wu Chih-sheng a hearty slap on the back and boomed:

“Chih-sheng, do you know that smart young fellow in the
white flannel that dashed in a moment ago? He’s a queer fish.
Han Meng-hsiang is his name; stockbroker by profession, but
writes poetry as well—quite good poetry, too. Funny combination,
that—poetry and lucre! But that's enough about him: let’s go
and look for Tu Hsueh-shih and Pei-shan. We may find them in
the small drawing-room, and the air there may be cleaner and
not reek of money-grubbing as it does here.”

Without waiting for his agreement, Fan Po-wen dragged Wu
Chih-sheng away with him. By now the dining-room had thinned
out, and only a handful of businessmen who were not greatly
concerned about the vicissitudes of government bonds and a few
people who were more concerned with politics, such as Col. Lei,
Huang Fen and Tang Yun-shan, still lingered there, helping
themselves to more lemonade and chattering away. But their
conversation had now turned from war and politics to amuse-
ments—roulette, bordellos, greyhound racing, romantic Turkish
baths, dancing girls, film stars. Col. Lei felt more at home on
these subjects and threw his reserve to the winds.

*

4)
As midday approached the mourners decreased in numbers
and the two bands took turns to play, occasionally stopping
altogether. When they did so, the unusual quiet made the
people in the dining-room feel as if their ears had been suddenly
unstopped and their talk about Turkish baths, dancing girls and
film stars sounded unusually loud.

Suddenly, they all fell silent as if ashamed to hear their own
smutty talk in the sudden quiet.

Tang Yun-shan involuntarily raised his hand to scratch his
bald head, glanced round, and burst out laughing; then all the
others quickly took their cue from him and laughed in unison
to cover the embarrassing situation.

When the laughter had subsided, Col. Lei turned to Chou
Chung-wei and said seriously:

“Everybody is saying that while gold is dear and silver is
cheap Chinese industrialists have an excellent opportunity to
develop their enterprises and sell their products. How far is that
true?”

Chou Chung-wei closed his eyes and shook his head, then
opened them again and replied with some bitterness:

“T for one am the victim of dear gold and cheap silver. The
raw materials needed for making matches, such as chemicals,
timber and boxes, are all imported. The price of gold rises
and with it the prices of raw materials: does that do me any
good? Shall I use Chinese materials, then? If I do, I am con-
fronted with a whole string of taxes—raw material tax, transit
duty, likin levy—which make our own raw materials dearer than
imported ones. On top of that, Japanese and Swedish matches
offer serious competition to Chinese matches, and our people
don’t know what patriotism is and won’t buy Chinese-made
goods... .”

Chou Chung-wei broke off in the middle of his patriotic
speech when his eyes chanced upon a box of “Phoenix” brand
matches, made in Sweden, lying beside a silver-plated ashtray.
He coughed with embarrassment, pulled out a handkerchief,
and wiped his plump face vigorously. Tang Yun-shan sniggered,
purposely reached out for the Swedish matches, and lit a Garrick.
Blowing out a cloud of smoke, he slapped Chou Chung-wei heavily
on the shoulder and said:

“I beg your pardon, Mr. Chou, but to tell the truth, your own
products could bear improvement. Leaving out your safety
matches for the moment, people say that your red-tipped matches
don’t strike easily. They won’t stand comparison with your
esteemed name.”

Chou Chung-wei’s face reddened like one of his own red-tipped
matches, but Sun Chi-jen came to his rescue:

“Mr. Chou’s hardly to blame for that. His workers are
pretty tough and not easy to manage. Since trade unions have
come into being, a lot of factories have been suffering from
idleness and have been turning out poor-quality products. Isn't
that so, Mr. Chu?”

“That’s it, but that isn’t all. Take our silk industry, which
is in a pitiful state. It’s being attacked from four sides: workers
demand higher wages; we're up against competition from
Japanese silk in foreign markets; taxes at home are crushing;
and the bankers are stingy with their loans. I ask you, what hope
is there for us, what with high production-costs, dwindling
markets, and a shortage of capital? It breaks my heart just to
think about it all.”

This sad tale came from Chu Yin-chiu. As he told it, the
vision of his four enemies hovered before his eyes, with the
bankers in the lead trying to strangle him. The Dragon-boat
Festival* would be upon him soon and all the banks and money-
lenders that had had dealings with him had warned him that
they would make no more advances and that he would have to
settle up promptly what was outstanding. But how could he
settle up with them? The price of silk was dropping, and his
exports were falling off. He drew a deep sigh and went on
resentfully:

“Since last year there’s been plenty of cash about in Shanghai.
Nobody can say money’s tight. But our bankers only invest in
government bonds and land, ten or twenty million dollars at a
time—simply throwing money about. When we industrialists get
a bit short and try to get a loan of a paltry hundred thousand or
eighty thousand dollars on some securities, they fight shy of us as

* The Dragon-boat Festival (Tuan Yang Chieh) falls on the fifth
day of the fifth lunar month. Chinese merchants used to settle ac-
counts on this day and also on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

if we were murderers after their blood.... And their terms
are so extortionate that—well, they make me see red!”

They all thought Chu Yin-chiu was being rather too outspoken
and nobody seemed willing to make any comment. Though Huang
Fen seemed sympathetic, he could not help saying:

“IT don’t see why you have to depend entirely on foreign markets
to sell your products. If you do, where do our own silk goods
manufacturers get their silk?”

“Yes, I don’t see that, either. Mr. Chen, you’re the man to
explain that to us,” Col. Lei interposed, appealing to Chen
Chun-yi, the owner of the Wu Yun Silk Goods Factory.

But the manufacturer merely smiled, and Chu Yin-chiu, the
silk producer, supplied the answer:

“The silk goods manufacturers used to buy only our second-
grade silk, and now they buy very little even of that; they prefer
to buy Japanese silk and rayon. For our top-grade silk, we have
always had to rely on the French and American markets, but
for the last couple of years the Japanese Government has gone
all out to encourage the Japanese silk producers to export their
silk and cocoons by making such exports duty-free. As a result,
Japanese silk has crowded out Chinese silk in Lyons and New
York.”

Col. Lei and Huang Fen sprang up with exclamations of
amazement and looked one by one at the circle of faces around
them, hoping to discover in them some sign of agreement, but,
to their even greater astonishment, there was not the slightest
expression of surprise on any of these faces, as if it were quite
natural for Chinese silk goods manufacturers not to use Chinese
silk. Chen Chun-yi said with deliberation:

“We've no other way out than to use some Japanese silk
or even rayon. Take Mr. Chu’s silk, for example. Production-
costs are high, which means a high price. If we buy his silk,
we pay the high price and 65 dollars and 60 cents purchase-
tax per picul into the bargain. As for silk produced in the
provinces, the prices have recently gone up as those of local
silk have, and we have to pay 111 dollars and 69 cents purchase-
tax per picul as well. And all that is just paying for the raw
material. .When it's been made into silk goods, we have to pay
a whole string of taxes in addition—production duty, transit
duty, market duty, and what have you. Every move the goods
make, there’s another tax to pay. Of course, all these taxes are
paid eventually by the consumers, But it means our sales are
reduced. Now, if we are to keep up our sales, we must find a
way of reducing costs, and the only way we can do that is to use
cheaper raw materials.... The consumers complain of high
prices, but it doesn’t mean that the producers are making any-
thing out of it.”

For a while no one spoke. The sound of the trumpets and
flutes of the band outside drifted in on the wind, so melancholy
that it might have been a dirge for the Chinese silk industry.
Wang Ho-fu, wllo had been silent all the while, suddenly stocd
up, clapped his hands together, and said jokingly:

“Let’s leave it at that, then! Mr. Chen goes on using his
Japanese silk and rayon, while Mr. Sun and I, as long as the
war lasts, hang on in Shanghai and have a good time going
around the dog-tracks and brothels! To hell with industry! Let’s
enjoy ourselves while we can.”

As he was saying this a sudden breath of perfume heralded a
young woman in a sleeveless, black silk summer dress in the
latest Paris style, which set off her smooth, white skin and her
fresh red lips. She did not speak at once, but just stood smiling
in the doorway and sweeping her eyes over the gathering.

The first to realize that she was there was the short, fat
man, Chou Chung-wei. He sprang up with a cry of delight,
waved his arms excitedly, and cried:

“Everybody stand up and welcome Miss Hsu Man-li, the
Flower of Society!”

All the men turned round. Before they could assume the
special smile which they reserved for greeting attractive women,
Miss Hsu was already giggling uncontrollably, her hips swaying
and her mouth hidden behind a handkerchief. Col. Lei rose
and stepped forward, holding out his hand, and said:

“Miss Hsu, you’re late. We'll have to punish you!”

“And how are you going to do that?” asked Hsu Man-li with
mock seriousness, swaying her hips once more and tilting her
head on one side. She went up to Col. Lei, squeezed his hand,

held it a few seconds, then dropped it and turned to greet the
others.

The conversation revived magically. Chu Yin-chiu and Chen
Chun-yi, who had a moment ago been grumbling, were now
beaming. While Hsu Man-li was busy chatting with the others,
Chu Yin-chiu leant across and whispered something to Tang Yun-
shan, who burst out laughing and looked at her intently. Chu
Yin-chiu turned to Chen Chun-yi, deliberately raising his voice:

“Y remember now, Mr. Chen. The woman who booked in at

“the Cathay Hotel with Chao Po-tao yesterday was... .”

Hsu Man-li turned her head sharply, riveted her eyes for a
fleeting moment on Chu Yin-chiu and immediately looked away
again. Without interrupting the smooth flow of her small-talk,
she strained her ears to catch every word Chu Yin-chiu might
be saying for her benefit.

But it was Chen Chun-yi’s voice that she heard next:

“Chao Po-tao? The one who goes in for government bonds?
He’s a big bull—grabs anything that’s going in the way of gov-
ernment stock.”

“And anything going in the way of women, too. Only yesterday
I met him with a certain widow.”

Chu Yin-chiu pretended to lower his voice, but he knew very
well that Hsu Man-li could still hear it. He noticed that she
seemed to be trembling all over and that even her laugh was
rather forced and shaky.

By now Col. Lei was completely engrossed in the “Flower of
Society” and their conversation became more and more lively and
intimate, until he said something which set her blushing; she
tilted her head coquettishly and giggled. Wang Ho-fu, who was
sitting nearby, stuck up his thumb in admiration and was going
to applaud, when Tang Yun-shan brushed past, grasped Col. Lei
by the shoulder and cried:

“T say, old chap! What are you trying to do—kill a bull?”

“Why? I never go in for government bonds,” replied the colonel
blankly,

“Well, then, when somebody else has already cornered some-
thing, why do you try so hard to get her away from him?”

As he said this, Tang Yun-shan burst out laughing himself.
Chu Yin-chiu and Chen Chun-yi applauded gleefully and roared
with laughter. Hsu Man-li blushed furiously though she pre-
tended not to notice the taunt, and tried to pass it off by calling

for lemonade. But everybody guessed what it was all about and
the big dining-room rang with peals of laughter.

The ragging might have gone on if Tu Chu-chai had not sudden-
ly appeared.

As if suddenly realizing that they had come to mourn the death
of Old Mr. Wu, who was at this moment lying in the next room,
and that Tu Chu-chai was the dead man’s son-in-law, they all
instantly checked their levity and tried to look serious, and some
of them yawned.

As usual Tu Chu-chai was all smiles and greeted everybody
courteously, at the same time mumbling as if to himself:

“Where’s Wu Sun-fu gone? He isn’t here either!”

“He hasn’t been here,” said one of them. Tu Chu-chai frowned
in perplexity, excused himself politely, and hurried out again.
Then Hsu Man-li slipped out, closely followed by Col. Lei. By
now everyone was tired of sitting about, and some of them went
out on to the veranda to look for friends. Only Huang Fen, Tang
Yun-shan, Sun Chi-jen remained, still huddled on a sofa, talking
quietly and seriously about the “Enlarged Conference of the
North’* and the strategy of General Yen Hsi-shan and General
Feng Yu-hsiang.

*

Failing to find Wu Sun-fu anywhere, Tu Chu-chai went out
into the garden, cut across the asphalt drive and clambered up
a big artificial hill. In a hexagonal pavilion at the top of the hill
two gentlemen were waiting for him rather impatiently. One of
them was in his forties, of medium height, with a pointed face and
black, piercing eyes. He was Chao Po-tao, the wizard of the
stock market, the man Chu Yin-chiu and the rest of them had

*In May 1930 Yen Hsi-shan and Feng Yu-hsiang, then warlords
in the North, joined with Li Tsung-jen, a warlord in Kwangsi Prov-
ince, and certain other warlords in the South in the formation of
a military alliance aimed against Chiang Kai-shek and launched a
full-scale war against him in Honan Province and other places. In
July of the same year the Kuomintang politician Wang Ching-wei,
in conjunction with Yen Hsi-shan, Feng Yu-hsiang, and the various
other warlords who were opposing Chiang Kai-shek, held their
Enlarged Conference in Peking, at which they decided to set up a
government in opposition to the Chiang Kai-shek régime in Nanking.
This military alliance was smashed by Chiang Kai-shek’s forces soon
after it was formed.

just been talking about. Seeing Tu Chu-chai panting up the
steps, he said to his companion:

“Mr. Shang, look, Tu Chu-chai’s on his own. It looks as if Wu
Sun-fu won’t bite.”

“Mr. Shang” slowly fingered his three-inch bushy beard, but
made no reply. Sixty if a day, he had a square face, large ears
and small eyes, and bore himself with dignity. If the Hung Hsien
dynasty of Yuan Shih-kai had not collapsed, he, Shang Chung-li,
might have qualified for the honour of “Literary Attendant” in the
imperial court. As it was, he had abandoned an official career
and gone into business and become chairman of the board of direc-
tors of a trust company, which he regarded as quite a come-down.

Tu Chu-chai sat down and mopped his brow with a handker-
chief, then looked up and said to Chao Po-tao and Shang Chung-li:

“T couldn’t find Sun-fu anywhere about the house. He wasn’t
in the ceremony hall nor in his room, nor in the dining-hall. His
wife and sisters couldn't tell me where he’d gone. And I couldn’t.
very well go around asking everybody I met, as you'd told me
to be careful not to attract too much attention. .... Well, you
might as well tell me all about your plan so that I can talk it
over with Sun-fu later on.”

“Well, as I told you just now, the idea is that the four of us
club together on the quiet to buy long in the government
bonds;* but first we must raise four million dollars in ready cash

*In those days government bonds were the chief object of specula-
tion on the Shanghai Stock and Bond Exchange. Independent of
their face value, their market quotation constantly fluctuated as a
result of the ceaseless civil strife. Quotations were also greatly in-
fluenced by the manipulation of speculators. Those who expected a
change in the political situation in favour of the government would
“bull” the market, i.e. buy long, in the belief that prices of the
bonds would rise, while those who thought prices would weaken
would ‘‘bear” the market, i.e. sell short. In addition there were the
small speculators who gambled on skilfully-spread rumours or “in-
side information’—all the tricks and ruses of the big “bulls” and
“bears” to influence the market in their favour. So the prices of
the bonds went up or down at each session of the Exchange, de-
pending on the buying or selling pressure. Thus, even though polit-
ical conditions might actually remain unchanged, the cut-throat fight
between the “bulls” and the “bears” went on in the Exchange. In
these speculative transactions no delivery of the bonds themselves
or the total amount of cash involved was looked for. All the money

within two days. Mr. Shang and I haven't the necessary capital,
but if you and Sun-fu are willing to come in on it, we'll go right
ahead with it. If you’re not, we'll say no more about it,” said
Chao Po-tao, talking quickly in Pekinese with a Cantonese
accent, while his deep-set eyes flashed a keen glance at Tu Chu-
chai to observe his reaction.

“I don’t see why you should want to buy long, though. For
the past few days, government bonds have been dropping as a
result of the war, and although they may come up again some
time in the future, you surely don't think the war’s going to be
over straight away? Anyway, it’s an open secret that the gov-
ernment troops are very hard pressed just now. Small holders
are selling out in a rush. Even if you buy in heavily, you won't
be able to hold up the prices. Besides, the settlement’s only ten
days away. Does it mean that you want to do the buying beyond
that date? If so, four million won’t be enough... !”

“That’s the way everybody looks at it, but there’s more to this
than meets the eye: we have a secret!” interrupted Chao Po-tao,
cutting Tu Chu-chai short and smiling mysteriously. Tu Chu-
chai tilted his head back and closed his eyes as if he were think-
ing hard. He knew that Chao Po-tao was infinitely resourceful,
knew how to bluff his way, and had contacts in the army and
in political circles, so perhaps he had got hold of secret informa-
tion about the military situation. But on second thoughts that
didn't seem likely. Tu Chu-chai opened his eyes again only
to meet Chao Po-tao’s, sharp and cunning. It suddenly occurred
to Tu Chu-chai that Chao Po-tao, a bull, confronted with the
coming settlement at the Dragon-boat Festival, was probably in
a panic about his financial affairs and that his “secret bull com-
pany” idea was merely a scheme to save himself.... But
why was Shang Chung-li going in with Chao Po-tao? The old
rogue was not buying long! With these thoughts racing through

the “bear” or the “bull” needed to have was the amount he thought
would be sufficient to cover his net loss by the settlement date.
This made it possible for speculators to gambie in bonds involving
many times the money they possessed. Such general practice, how-
ever, did not exclude the employment by the more powerful specula-
tors like Chao Po-tao, as described in the latter part of the book, of
all sorts of political tricks to bring their opponents to ruin.

his mind, Tu Chu-chai looked into Shang Chung-li’s face for
his answer.

But the old man looked perfectly at ease and raised three
fingers to stroke his beard.

“what's the secret?” Tu Chu-chai asked offhandedly, at the
same time weighing all the possibilities in his mind. He had
almost made up his mind to put them off and make good his
escape before he was persuaded to have a hand in their “plot.”
But Chao Po-tao’s answer came as a shock:

“Mr. Shang guarantees that the Northwestern Army will call
a halt to their advance. Before the settlement for this month
is due government bonds will certainly rise again.”

Although Chao Po-tao said this in a very low voice, the news
struck Tu Chu-chai like a bolt from the blue, blotting out the
din in the garden and the efforts of the two bands. He looked
at Shang Chung-li in amazement and asked doubtfully:

“Are you so sure about it, then, Mr. Shang?”

“Tt isn’t a matter of being sure: it’s a matter of making sure,”
replied Shang Chung-li quietly, stroking his beard and smiling
at Chao Po-tao, Tu Chu-chai was still in the dark: the words
“making sure” puzzled him. In the ordinary way he had enough
confidence in Shang Chung-li when he acted as a guarantor for
some business transaction or other, but this case was out of the
ordinary and so much would be at stake that he felt he had to
make sure of everything. Hesitation and uncertainty were
written all over his goat-like face.

Chao Po-tao slapped his thigh and laughed, then leant across
and said quietly and seriously to Tu Chu-chai:

“As I was saying, we have a secret. Everybody knows that
an army can be bribed to win, but nobody seems to have thought
of bribing it to lose a battle. What’s one defeat more or less
if you’re getting paid for it?”

Tu Chu-chai could scarcely believe his own ears. He racked
his brains, stood up, stretched out his right hand to give Shang
Chung-li the “thumbs up” sign, and burst into compliments:

“Mr. Shang, my congratulations on your rare wisdom and
acumen! This is really wonderful!”

“So you’ve made up your mind to go along with us, then.
How about Wu Sun-fu? Will you speak to him as soon as pos-

sible?” Chao Po-tao immediately urged, wanting to clinch the
matter there and then.

But Shang Chung-li saw that Tu Chu-chai was still wavering
slightly. He knew that the latter, although he always had an
eye for the main chance, was extremely wary, unlike Wu Sun-
fu who was fearless and energetic, so he qualified his remarks:

“Although the person who deputizes for us in negotiations
with the authorities on the other side has reached agreement
on the terms, we wouldn’t say that it’s irrevocably fixed. Any
deal with military men, you know, is necessarily touch-and-go,
as they may change their minds at the last minute. My idea
is, you’d better talk it over with Wu Sun-fu and get in touch
with us later in the day.”

“So you’ve agreed on terms?”

“Yes: three hundred thousand dollars,’ Chao Po-tao answered
with an air of impatience.

Tu Chu-chai stuck out his tongue, withdrew it, and grinnea,

“No more, no less. We can't afford more, and they won’t do
it for less. Thirty thousand dollars a mile. If they retreat ten
miles, they’ll get three hundred thousand dollars,” said Shang
Chung-li deliberately, fixing his cunning little eyes on Tu Chu-
chai’s goat-like face.

For a moment no one spoke; then Tu Chu-chai, the light of
determination in his eyes, looked first at Shang Chung-li and
then at Chao Po-tao. Simultaneously, the three of them burst
out laughing, then put their heads together in an animated
conversation.

Meanwhile, on the other side of a pond in front of the pavilion,
three young men and two girls were sitting on a lawn in the
shade of some willows, debating hotly among themselves. The
girls were not taking a very active part in the debate, but their
giggles were enough to disturb the geese who were enjoying a
siesta on the waters of the pond.

“Let’s leave it at that,” said a lively cat-faced youngster. “Be
quiet, everybody, and I'll run and fetch them.” He was Tu
Chu-chai’s brother Hsueh-shih, an engineering college student.

“Do you agree, Miss Lin?” Wu Chih-sheng asked Lin Pei-
shan, who pretended not to hear, but continued to hold Chang
Su-su’s hands and seesaw backwards and forwards.

Fan Po-wen, standing next to Lin Pei-shan, smiled non-
committally.

“No object ons? Passed unanimously!” cried Tu Hsueh-shih
as he ran off towards the house. Wu Chih-sheng walked up and
down with bent head for a while, stopped before Fan Po-wen and
challenged him excitedly:

“There's another point. Will you take a bet on it?”

“Let’s hear it. It may not be worth betting on.”

“My point is: can Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan change their tem-
peraments?”

“I won't take a bet on that.”

“1 will, Chih-sheng, but tell me first what you think. Will they
change or won't they?” interrupted Chang Su-su, letting go of
Lin Pei-shan’s hand and coming over to Wu Chih-sheng.

“wWhat’s the bet—a kiss?”

“If I win, I certainly don’t want to kiss your ugly mug

Fan Po-wen and the others roared with laughter, except for
Chang Su-su herself. who just stood there hopping on one foot. She
was thinking about Huei-fang’s reserve and her staid expression.
It was enough to exasperate you-and make you feel sorry for
her just to look at her. As for Ah-hsuan, although he was
fairly good-looking, he was rather scatter-brained — sometimes
he seemed bright enough, but at other times he was terribly
muddle-headed. Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan were two monuments
to the educative influence of the late Old Mr. Wu and his
Book of Rewards and Punishments. It made her feel uncom-
fortable to think about them and she forgot all about the bet.
Just then Tu Hsueh-shih ran back with two men in tow: Prof.
Li Yu-ting and Mr. Chiu Chun, Wu Sun-fu’s legal adviser.

From the hexagonal pavilion on the artificial hill opposite, the
laughter of Chao Po-tao, Shang Chung-li and Tu Chu-chai carried
down to the lawn. Li Yu-ting looked up at them, then tugged
at Chiu Chun’s arm and whispered:

“Look! The Big Three of the financial world. What do you
think they are up to now?”

Chiu Chun smiled and was going to answer, when Wu Chih-

p

sheng’s voice broke in:
“Mr. Chiu Chun and Prof. Li, we want your opinion... .
Speak frankly, as I’ve got a bet on with Fan Po-wen: Can a

man protect his national interests and his class interests at the
same time? Is there a conflict between the two?’

“Mr. Chiu and Prof. Li, don’t be afraid to state your views
squarely. This is very important, as Wu Chih-sheng and Fan
Po-wen have a bet on it,’ Tu Hsueh-shih put in emphatically,
glancing at Lin Pei-shan, who tried to look indifferent. Squat-
ting down, she began picking up fallen rose petals and arranging
them in the character wen.

Chiu Chun shook his head modestly, so Li Yu-ting spoke up
first:

“That all depends on the social status of the man concerned.”

“Yes, we’ve had examples of that. Suppose, in view of the
depression in the silk industry, Wu Sun-fu said to his workers:
‘Our production-costs are so high that we can’t compete with
Japanese silk producers and our silk industry’ll be ruined. To
cut the cost of production we must cut your wages. For the
sake of our national interests, you’ll have to bear up and be
content with lower wages.’ The workers would reply: ‘The
cost of living’s so high that we don’t get enough to eat as it is.
If you cut our wages any more, we're done for. You mill-owners
have plenty of money and never know what starvation is. If
you want to look after our national interests, you'll have to put
up with a cut in your profits.” So you see that there is some-
thing to be said for both sides, but on both sides there is a clash
between national and class interests.”

“Of course, starvation is no joke...” began Li Yu-ting, then
hesitated and raised a hand to scratch his head. Chang Su-su
looked hard at him, but he was not conscious of it. There was
silence as everybody waited for him to finish the sentence.
Across the pond, the pavilion echoed with another gust of laughter.
Li Yu-ting looked up with a start and then went on to finish
what he was saying:

“On the other hand, capitalists must make a profit. No profit,
no business!”

Wu Chih-sheng laughed exultantly and turned to Fan Po-wen:

“There now! What did I say? This is just what I expected
from Prof. Li. My dear poet, you’ve lost one bet already. Now
for the other one. If you'll just state your side of the case. ...
Su-su, see that Pei-shan doesn’t run away.”

Fan Po-wen smiled icily but remained silent, so Tu Hsueh-
shih jumped in and spoke for him:

“The workers put in a demand for higher wages. The boss
says: ‘If you want higher wages, you’d better go and work some-
where else. I can easily get someone to replace you.’ But the
workers refuse to go and insist on their demand for higher
wages. ... There’s a problem for our legal adviser.”

“Both capital and labour are under contract. Neither can
force the other to do anything against their will.”

Wu Chih-sheng and the others laughed and even Fan Po-wen
joined in. Lin Pei-shan, who had been squatting on the ground
and pretending not to take any notice, sprang up and was about
to make her escape, when Wu Chih-sheng and Chang Su-su
blocked her way, crying:

“Now, now. Don’t run away! The poet’s absolutely defeated
and you must settle his account for him, otherwise we'll take
our case to the lawyer here. Tu Hsueh-shih, you’re our guaran-
tor and you must fulfil your obligations.”

Lin Pei-shan giggled but refused to speak. At the first op-
portunity, she slipped under Chang Su-su's arm and raced away
along a parti-coloured cobbled path, skirting the pond and turn-
ing right. With a surprised “oh!” Chang Su-su followed in
pursuit. Fan Po-wen, holding Wu Chih-sheng by the shoulder,
said:

“Don’t get excited. Just wait. Tu Hsueh-shih’s going to pass
judgement.”

“What? A guarantor be a judge? Simply isn’t done. Besides,
we didn’t agree on this beforehand.”

“It was agreed: ‘If the lawyer's or the professor’s views
prove inconclusive, Tu Hsueh-shih shall arbitrate.’ Now I con-
sider both their views ambiguous. It isn't fair just to say that
I'm the loser.”

“Both views are irresponsible and superficial, since they didn't
give any reasoning,” broke in Tu Hsueh-shih, his cat-like face
suddenly very stern.

Not only was Wu Chih-sheng surprised at this, but the lawyer
and the professor were also puzzled. Everybody clustered round
Tu Hsueh-shih, waiting for him to go on.

“All this talk about national interests, class interests and
capital-and-labour contracts is a lot of nonsense — mere words.
I recognize only the state. And the helm of the state must be
in the firm grip of men of iron. What’s important is to get
things done, not to theorize about them. No one should be
permitted to oppose these men of iron who rule the state. For
instance, if Chinese silk can’t compete with Japanese silk, then
it’s the duty of the rulers to cut the workers’ wages on the one
hand and on the other to compel the Chinese capitalists to sell
at the lowest possible prices, so that Chinese silk can hold its
own against Japanese silk in the European and American markets.
If the capitalists refuse to obey, then the state should confiscate
their factories.”

Tu Hsueh-shih concluded his speech abruptly, glaring around
and swaggering as if he were one of these “men of iron.”

His listeners smiled, but no one spoke. They heard Chang
Su-su and Lin Pei-shan giggling as they approached from the
clump of trees at the other end of the pond. Fan Po-wen looked
round at the sound of the voices, then clapped Tu Hsueh-shih on
the shoulder and jeered:

“Jolly good! But, unfortunately, you’re neither a capitalist nor
a worker, still less a ‘man of iron hand.’ And what’s more, your
little speech was just as ‘superficial and without any reasoning’
as anything else. Please remember, my bet with Wu Chih-sheng
wasn’t about what should be done, but who could guess what
the lawyer and the professor were going to say.... But let’s say
no more about this betting business—let’s call it a day.”

With this Fan Po-wen ran off to meet the girls.

“Oh, no, my dear poet, you don’t get away with it as easily as
that,” shouted Wu Chih-sheng, running after Fan Po-wen, while
the lawyer and the professor stood there and laughed.

Just as Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-sheng got up to Chang Su-
su and Lin Pei-shan, they saw three men coming towards them:
Chao Po-tao, Shang Chung-li and Tu Chu-chai. They were talk-
ing in an undertone as they walked along, but, at the sight of
the youngsters, they fell silent and turned aside without a word
along the cobbled path towards the willow grove, at the same
time making a detour on their way back to the house to avoid
being seen by Chiu Chun and Li Yu-ting. But Li Yu-ting’s sharp

eyes had spotted them and, tugging at the corner of Chiu Chun’s
jacket, he said quietly:

“Look, the Big Three of the financial world! See them?
Something big in the air, by the look on their faces.”

“Perhaps they’re worried about the ‘man of iron’ who’s just
been born in our midst!” replied Chiu Chun with a smile, and
Li Yu-ting laughed. Absorbed in his own thoughts, Tu Hsueh-
shih did not hear the quip meant for him.

*

On the stone steps in front of the ceremonial hall Tu Chu-chai
ran into a new arrival, a distant relative of the Wu family,
Lu Kuang-shih by name, a stockbroker and assistant manager
of the Great Asia Trust Company. The moment he saw Tu
Chu-chai he buttonholed him and whispered in his ear:

“I've got a tip for you. The Central Army’s fighting better
now, and government bonds will soon be up again. Strictly con-
fidential! But most people are still expecting a fall, and small
holders are anxious to sell out while they can. Why not make
the most of this opportunity and buy up several hundred
thousand? I know you’ve only been going in for gold bars, but
now you must try government bonds as well just this once. Go
on, do yourself a bit of good while you've got the chance.”

Lu Kuang-shih may have given this tip with the best of in-
tentions, but it only scared Tu Chu-chai, who was contemplat-
ing having a hand in the secret bull-company. As he listened,
he paled and began to have misgivings: surely the news of
Shang Chung-li’s plan hadn’t leaked out already? Or was the
Central Army in fact getting the upper hand now? Were Chao
Po-tao and Shang Chung-li playing a shabby trick on him? Or
was this man Lu Kuang-shih just rumour-mongering for his own
ends? Tu Chu-chai was in a quandary and did not know what
to say. He tipped Chao Po-tao a wink—he had in fact only
meant to look and see what his reactions were, but somehow
the look turned into a wink. Even an old hand like him had
made a blunder this time.

Fortunately, he was rescued from his embarrassment by the
arrival of the butler Kao Sheng, who hurried over to him and
said:

“Mr. Tu, the master would like to see you. He’s in the
library.”

Relieved, Tu Chu-chai answered “Thank you” and turned to
Lu Kuang-shih:

“Excuse me a moment. I’ll be seeing you later. Please make
yourself at home in the dining-room. —Kao Sheng, get Mr. Lu
some tea.”

Having got rid of Lu Kuang-shih, he and the other two went
out into the garden again and found a quiet corner, where they
held another whispered conference, their faces lighting up with
pleasure.

“Well, I’m off to see Sun-fu. Po-tao, you’ll deal with Lu
Kuang-shih; you can find him in the dining-room. Mr. Shang,
you'll get things straightened out with the man from the North,”
said Tu Chu-chai finally, and the three men went their different
ways.

When he reached the library Tu Chu-chai was surprised to find
Wu Sun-fu sitting there with his brows knitted in a deep frown.
He had not looked so upset as this even when Old Mr. Wu had
died the night before. Directly Tu Chu-chai sat down, and be-
fore he could say a word, Wu Sun-fu tossed over a sheet of paper.
It was a telegram, and it read: “Unrest among peasants, troops
inadequate, situation critical, advise measures, urgent, Fei, 7th.”

Tu Chu-chai paled. Though he had not so much property at
stake in their home town as Wu Sun-fu had, it was inevitable
that he should feel upset to hear that the place where he had
his ancestral home and graveyard was now in danger. Laying
down the telegram, he glanced at Wu Sun-fu and said briefly:

“What do you propose to do, then?”

“I'll do what’s humanly possible. It’s lucky the old man
and Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan got out two days ago, otherwise I
shouldn’t know what to do with them. At the moment I’ve only
a pawnshop, a local bank and a rice-mill marooned there, and
although they’re worth more than a little, they’re not a matter
of life or death.... You ask what I propose to do. Well, I’ve
wired my agent Fei Little Beard to put my ready cash in a safe
place and move out what goods he can from the business prem-
ises. Of course, it may be that it’s only a false alarm and that
things will settle down again soon. That garrison is under

strength and something ought to be done about it; we should
send a joint telegram to the provincial government to send down
the security troops immediately to restore order.”

Wu Sun-fu did not look quite like his usual self. He had
been rambling on before he came to the point—the wire to the
provincial government. He handed Tu Chu-chai the draft which
he had made and pressed the bell on the wall behind him.

The door opened softly and two men entered, the butler Kao
Sheng and Mo Kan-cheng, the chief clerk in the factory.

Wu Sun-fu frowned even more when he saw that Mo Kan-
cheng had come without being sent for and snapped sternly:

“TC didn’t send for you. I told you that you meedn’t come here
today, but stay and look after the factory. It’s more important
for you to remain there.”

The old clerk was frightened out of his wits by this reproof.
He simply answered “Yes, yes” and stood rooted to the ground.

“Has anything gone wrong in the factory?” asked Wu Sun-fu
offhandedly, relaxing his features. He was not thinking of the
factory, but of his home town and the threat of a riot among
the peasants. Mo Kan-cheng’s tremulous reply came as a sur-
prise:

“Things in the factory are none too pleasant, sir... .

“What? Out with it! What’s the matter?”

“Perhaps it isn’t all that important, but . . . but I don’t like the
way things are shaping. We haven’t yet announced the wage-cut,
but the women have somehow found out about it. Since this
morning they’ve been... well, they’ve been going slow. So I
came to ask you, sir... what should we do about it?”

Wu Sun-fu’s face suddenly darkened and he sat speechless,
the purplish pimples on his face turning livid with rage. All of
a sudden he sprang up and bellowed like a madman, cursing the
women workers and cursing Mo Kan-cheng and his subordinates:

“So they’re going slow now, are they, the bitches? T’ll show
them a thing or two! And what have you lot in the office been
doing about it all this time? Huh! all you're fit for is loafing
about and skylarking and flirting with the girls! Perhaps it was
one of your fools who let on about the wage-cut.”

Mo Kan-cheng just stood there hanging his head and hardly
daring to breathe. His helpless manner served only to fan the

”

flames of Wu Sun-fu’s rage: his right hand on his hip and his
left clenched and poised on the edge of the steel desk, he glared
round the room with eyes ablaze as if looking for something to
fix his teeth into. He suddenly discovered the butler Kao Sheng
standing stiffly in the corner, and immediately turned on him
furiously:

“What are you doing here?”

“I just came in when you rang, sir.”

Wu Sun-fu remembered the telegram and realized that Tu
Chu-chai was still there, sitting on the other side of the table.
By now he had glanced through the draft and was engrossed
in his own thoughts, his eyes closed and a cigar jutting from the
corner of his mouth.

Wu Sun-fu picked up the telegram and handed it to Kao Sheng,
waved him away and said:

“Send this off at once—the quicker the better.”

He sat down on the chromium-plated swivel-chair, scribbled a
few words on a slip of paper, then crumpled it up and threw
it into the waste-paper basket. He hesitated, his pen poised.

Tu Chu-chai opened his eyes, and when he saw Wu Sun-fu’s
perplexity he said softly:

“Sun-fu, I think the smooth way is better than the rough.”

“That’s what I was thinking .. .” replied Wu Sun-fu, a little
calmer now. Rolling his pen between his fingers, he turned to Mo
Kan-cheng:

“Kan-cheng, sit down and tell me all about what happened
this morning.”

The old clerk, who was quite used to Wu Sun-fu’s moods, re-
alized that he could now speak up boldly and that there was no
longer any need to keep up the pretence of terrified helpless-
ness, so he sat down at once in an easy-chair beside the desk
and began slowly:

“This morning at about nine o’clock, forewoman No. 2, Wang
Chin-chen, ran into my office to report that Yao Chin-feng in Row
No. 12 had made a mistake and was being insubordinate about
it. Then forewoman No. 9 Hsueh Pao-chu asked Yao Chin-feng
to come along to my office. Then what should happen but that
all the women in Row No. 12 switched off their machines and
were backing up Yao Chin-feng by making a disturbance... .

I was just going along to see what I could do to stop it, when
I heard a lot of shouting and screaming, and up came Hsueh
Pao-chu dragging Yao Chin-feng along with her. By this time
all the women had switched off their machines... .”

Wu Sun-fu frowned, looked sharply at Mo Kan-cheng, and
cut him short impatiently:

“Make it brief. Just tell me how things stand now.”

“At the moment only a small proportion of the five hundred
and twenty filatures are running ...and the women who are
still working are only spoiling the cocoons.”

At this Wu Sun-fu growled angrily, sprang up, dropped back
into his chair, and asked quickly:

“What’s the reason for this go-slow?”

“They’re demanding that we sack Hsueh Pao-chu.”

“Why’s that?”

“They say she hit Yao Chin-feng. ... And they are demand-
ing a cost-of-living allowance, too. They made the same demand
once before when the price of rice went up to twenty dollars
per picul and now they’re bringing it up again.”

Wu Sun-fu snorted and turned to Tu Chu-chai. “Chu-chai,
I can tell you it’s no fun running a silk factory. When rice goes
up, the workers demand a cost-of-living allowance; but when the
price of silk drops, we make a loss—but no one makes us a silk
allowance! Right: go back, Kan-cheng, and tell them this: if
they want a cost-of-living allowance, I will close down my
factory.”

Mo Kan-cheng said “yes” but his little rat’s eyes stared at Wu
Sun-fu with great embarrassment.

“What now?”

“Yes, sir...er... excuse me, but I’m afraid that if you tell
them you’re going to close down the factory just at this moment,
it might cause trouble... .”

“What do you mean?”

“This time, the women seem to be more united, as if it’s all
been arranged beforehand.”

“Pooh! What are you—a lot of zombies? You haven’t a clue
what’s going on until something happens, and then you come
crying to me. Forewoman No. 2, Wang Chin-chen, and the over-
seer Pockmarked Li both get my special bonus, don’t they? Yet

they don’t seem to be doing much in the way of keeping an
eye on the women. You’d think I had too much money and
nothing to spend it on, the way I keep feeding those dogs for
nothing.”

By now Mo Kan-cheng had plucked up courage again and spoke
up. “They do do their best, both of them. They’re continually
watching and listening to see what the women are up to, but
you’d think they had the word ‘informer’ written all over them:
everywhere they turn they come up against a brick wall and
they find it difficult to ferret out any information at all. I’m
telling you, sir: you’d think the women were possessed. the way
they go on. Yao Chin-feng used to be quite obedient, but now
she’s one of the ringleaders. All you hear in the workshop now
is: ‘The last time we demanded a cost-of-living allowance, you
soft-soaped us with false promises, but this time we really mean
business! Don’t you dare tell us you’re going to cut our wages.
We want a cost-of-living allowance. D’you hear? A_ cost-of-
living allowance!’ I hear they’re having trouble in other factories,
too. You’d think the workers were all possessed by devils.”

“Possessed by devils, eh? Ha, ha! I can tell you what sort of
devils, too: high cost of living and hunger. But there’s another
devil, a much more terrible one than that: world depression and
slump. .. .”

Wu Sun-fu broke into loud, cynical laughter, pain and despair
written all over his purplish face; but he quickly recovered his
customary firmness and determination. Gesticulating excitedly,
he went on, his lips twisted in a savage smile.

“Very well, you devils—we’ll see! Think I’m done for, eh?
Oh, no! We'll have a go first!—Now, Kan-cheng, how did the
women come to Know about the wage-cut? One of your people
in the office must have let on about it!”

Mo Kan-cheng was taken aback by this question, and cold
shivers ran down his spine. He hesitated, then a sudden idea
struck him, and he said furtively:

“T suspect Tu Wei-yueh. That young man has gone daft just
lately. All he thinks about all day is Chu Kuei-ying, one of the
girls in Row 19. People are always seeing him going in and out

of her house... .

The door suddenly opened, and the voice of Fu-fang inter-
rupted Mo Kan-cheng in the middle of what he was saying.

“Sun-fu, the men from the International Undertakers have ar-
rived with the funeral things, but I don’t think the coffin is
quite good enough,” said Fu-fang, pausing in the doorway and
looking in at her husband sitting opposite to her brother.

“Hold on; Pl be with you in a minute. Chu-chai, could you
just go and have a look at it?”

Tu Chu-chai, waving a hand, spoke to his wife through the
cloud of cigar-smoke:

“We shan’t be long. It’s early yet. If the coffin’s no good, we
can change it in plenty of time.”

“Rarly? It’s a quarter past twelve already and the visitors are
having lunch.”

So saying, Fu-fang went away again. Wu Sun-fu turned to
Mo Kan-cheng and snapped out his orders:

“Now, go straight back to the factory and put up a notice an-
nouncing a paid half-holiday this afternoon in memory of the
late Old Mr. Wu. See to it that the women go home—we don’t
want them staying in the factory and making trouble. But you
and your men will have some special work to do this afternoon:
you will go about among the women, work on them separately
and break their unity. You’ve got until this evening to get the
job done. Meanwhile, you can call in policemen from the Bureau
of Public Safety to guard the factory, and send a report to the
Bureau of Social Affairs about the trouble. As for that fellow
Tu Wei-yueh, send him round to me this evening. Got that?
All right, then, make yourself scarce.”

Having got rid of Mo Kan-cheng, Wu Sun-fu stood up, drew a
deep sigh, and muttered to himself:

“Damn this factory business! I should have had a bank in-
stead of a factory right from the start. If I had, I could have
had something by now to show for it, with my ability and capi-
tal. The Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank only had a
hundred thousand dollars when they started up, and look at
them now... .”

He paused and stroked his chin, then pulled himself together
and smacked his right fist into his left hand.

“No! I must carry on! There are not many of China’s na-
tional industries left: you can count them, on the fingers of one
hand. And the silk industry is especially important to the future

of the nation. ... If only the country were something like a
country and the government were something like a government,
Chinese industry could really do well in the future... . Chu-

chai, I’ve got an idea, but there’s no time to tell you about it
just now. Let’s go and see the coffin they’ve sent first.”

“Just a minute. I’ve got something important to tell you, too.”

Tu Chu-chai took the cigar-stub out of his mouth and stood
up. He moved closer to Wu Sun-fu and told him the whole
story of the “plot” devised by Chao Po-tao and Shang Chung-li.
When he came to the end, he asked, “Now, Sun-fu, do you think
there’s a catch in it? If you won’t go in, I won’t either.”

“A million each? Half the sum cash down today?” Wu Sun-
fu asked rather non-committally and with a straight face.

“Yes, that’s their idea. Chao Po-tao’s plan is this: this after-
noon, he’ll sell out three million short to bring the price down
even more... .”

“Yes, that would certainly do the trick. There may be a drop
of two or three dollars. Then we cover, I suppose?”

“No, not yet. In tomorrow’s first session, we’ll sell another—
five million short, in Chao Po-tao’s name.”

“Oh! Then the slump will set in. If Chao Po-tao, the famous
bull, sells, the small-fry holders will panic and rush to sell out.
Then, of course, when people see the market is falling, a lot of
new bears will be coming on the scene.”

“Exactly. So we'll wait until tomorrow’s afternoon session
before we begin covering. We'll cover slowly and in small
lots, here and there, so as not to attract attention. When we
get to within a few days of the settlement, we should have col-
lected at least fifty million, .. .”

“And then the news of the Northwestern Army’s retreat will
suddenly break and there’ll be an uproar!”

“exactly. Then all the small-fry will rush to buy and turn
bulls. With the settlement and the Dragon-boat Festival only a
few days off, the bears will also be anxious to cover, faced as
they will be with a rapid rise.”

“Then we'll unload our fifty million, and they’ll look on us
as their saviours!”

At this the two of them roared with laughter together, their
eyes gleaming with delight and excitement.

Wu Sun-fu stopped and said briskly, “Done! Let’s go in and
win! But we are making it so easy for the big bull Chao Po-
tao to take advantage of this deal, and make a packet out of it
for himself. We must put forward our own terms, in addition
to what we shall gain on the bonds. Let’s go and find him and
talk it over.”

With these words they left the library. The “great scheme”
which Wu Sun-fu had been turning over in his mind for some
time had now flooded his entire consciousness.
It

IT was two o'clock in the afternoon. The sky was cloudy and
the heat oppressive. The International Undertakers had not
yet delivered the coffin ordered by Fu-fang—one with a thick
pane of glass let into the lid so that Old Mr. Wu’s remains could
be seen. The two sisters, Fu-fang and Huei-fang, had rejected
the first coffin delivered as unsatisfactory and ordered another,
so the shrouding ceremony had to be put back one hour. Mean-
while they kept hurrying the undertakers up both by telephone
and by special messengers. The Wus were all ready and were
only waiting for the arrival of the coffin from the undertakers
to complete the ceremony.

Many of the mourners had already gone and there remained
only a few relatives and close friends and a number of peo-
ple who had no other calls on their time. They were chatting
in scattered groups in the cool of the garden and waiting patient-
ly for the shrouding.

The dining-room was now deserted except for a handful of
servants clearing away the beer and lemonade bottles and
sweeping up the litter of fruit peel on the floor. As they worked,
they grumbled among themselves:

“Our master’s a hasty one and no mistake! He even tries
to rush an important thing like his father’s funeral in one day.
You just can’t do things like that!”

“Ah, that’s his quick temper makes him like that. Kao Sheng
says he was in a filthy temper in the library this morning—
frightened Mr. Mo from the factory out of his wits, he did! Old
Mr. Wu was lucky to get out when he did: another couple of
days and it would have been too late. I hear a telegram came
this morning saying that the peasants are up in arms down there
in the country. That’s why he’s in such a state, I suppose.”

This remark was made by Li Kuei. He had originally been
a footman to Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s parents and, after their death.
had come over to the Wu household. If the thirty-odd servants
in the household could be said to have party affiliations, then
Li Kuei was on the side of his mistress.

“They’ve spent more than five hundred and sixty dollars to-
day on cars and tips alone. And the guests got through thirty
dozen bottles of beer and lemonade,” said another servant,
changing the subject.

“I expect the tip for us will be at least a thousand dollars,”
said Li Kuei. At the words “a thousand dollars” everyone cheered
up, but in a moment their despondency returned, for they knew
from experience that the tip would be divided up among the
servants according to their grades and that even if it were
divided up equally, it would have to go round among more than
a hundred when you include the ushers, musicians, masters of
ceremonies and all the others hired for the occasion, so that
in the end each one would get only a miserable little sum. At
this prospect they all became half-hearted in their efforts and
were even more lethargic than before the tip was mentioned.
They were just about to give vent to their resentment again when
‘someone came in.

It was Fan Po-wen, looking no more cheerful than the de-
spondent servants. He stopped in the middle of the room,
wheeled round, and muttered to himself:

“Why, there isn’t a soul here! I say, Li Kuei, have you seen
Miss Pei-shan anywhere?”

But he was off without waiting for a reply. He went through
the other section of the dining-room, out on to the veranda,
then into the drawing-room looking round with wide eyes. The
room was rather quiet just now, and he found none of the ladies
there. Several women servants were keeping vigil, sitting on a
bench against the wall and looking like a row of black clay
figures. The body of Old Mr. Wu was lying on its bier in the
centre of the room, heaped about with mounds of flowers among
which large blocks of ice glittered coldly.

Fan Po-wen shivered in spite of himself, quickly pushed
through the white curtains out on to the stone steps in front

of the house. He drew a deep breath and looked up at the sky,
a cold feeling of loneliness and desolation flooding his poetic soul.

By the archway over the stone steps the funeral musicians
were dozing and hugging their instruments. After hours of
hard work they were now snatching forty winks while they
could and saving their energy for a final effort at the shrouding
ceremony.

Fan Po-wen found everything an eyesore: it was all so con-
ventional, vulgar and disgusting that he could hardly contain
himself. Just then, Wu Chih-sheng came running up the asphalt
drive full of excitement, as if he had made a discovery. Seeing
Fan Po-wen standing there alone, he grasped him by the arm
and dragged him off with him. Following him absently, Fan
Po-wen asked, “Have you seen Pei-shan anywhere?”

“1'll tell you about it later. Just now I want you to come
along and see something—quite an eye-opener, I assure you!”

Wu Chih-sheng led Fan Po-wen through a lilac grove to a
quiet corner on the east side of the garden, where there was a
greenhouse, covered over now with a mat awning. To the left
of the greenhouse were three foreign-style rooms with open
windows hung on the outside with patterned Japanese screens
of fine bamboo. From behind the screens came gusts of laughter.

“Why, this is a billiard-room. I don’t play billiards, you
know,” said Fan Po-wen, shaking his head, but Wu Chih-sheng
immediately put his hand over Fan Po-wen’s mouth and whis-
pered in his ear, “Be quiet. Just have a look, and you'll see
what kind of billiards they’re playing!”

The two of them tiptoed up to one of the windows and peeped
in. A scene of revelry met their eyes. The society girl Hsu
Man-li, her feet bare, was dancing gracefully on a billiard-table.
Her arms outstretched and one leg held high in the air, so that
her whole weight was supported on the point of the other foot,
she pirouetted rapidly on the smooth, soft baize, the hem of her
dress flaring out like a parasol and revealing her soft white
thighs and her round hips sheathed in pink silk underwear.
Chu Yin-chiu, Sun Chi-jen, Wang Ho-fu and Chen Chun-yi were
sitting on high stools by the billiard-table, clapping their hands
and laughing hilariously, while Chou Chung-wei brandished a
billiard cue as if he were conducting an orchestra. Suddenly,

Hsu Man-li leapt lightly on to the next billiard-table. This feat
brought a roar of applause from the onlookers, but just then she
seemed to slip. She twisted and swayed as if she was going
to fall, but Col. Lei dashed forward and caught her in time,
hugging her to his chest.

“No cheating! You shouldn’t take advantage of her like that!”
protested Tang Yun-shan, balancing Hsu Man-li’s high-heeled
black satin shoes on his bald head.

Then a riot ensued. The men and the girl struggled together,
laughing and shouting hysterically. The four onlookers jumped
down from their stools and joined in.

Outside the window Fan Po-wen pulled Wu Chih-sheng aside,
frowned and said scornfully, ‘““What’s so unusual about that?
Is that all you dragged me over here to see? I’ve seen worse
than that!”

“But aren’t these people the ‘pillars of society’ who are always
holding forth on propriety between the sexes?”

“Huh! Don't be so naive. They may talk about morals, but
they still have to dance their death dance. Do you know what’s
meant by the death dance? Well, as the villages become more
and more bankrupt, the abnormal development of the cities be-
comes faster, the price of rice and gold soars, the civil war
becomes fiercer, the unrest among the peasantry more wide-
spread—and the death dance of the rich becomes wilder. There’s
nothing new about it. Why should we be watching it? We'd
be better employed looking for Pei-shan and the others.”

Fan Po-wen turned to go, but Wu Chih-sheng pulled him back.

Meanwhile, the billiard-room had become the scene of another
performance. Somebody was croaking a song. Wu Chih-sheng
hauled Fan Po-wen back to the window. Hsu Man-li was still
dancing on the table, this time not so fast. The short, fat man
Chou Chung-wei was squatting on the floor and hopping about
like a frog, clicking his tongue and balancing Hsu Man-li’s shoes
on his head. The singer turned out to be Col. Lei; with his
chest sticking out and his head thrown back, he could not have
looked more earnest and serious if he had been singing a
marching-song.

With a glance over his shoulder at Fan Po-wen, Wu Chih-
sheng darted to the door of the billiard-room, jerked aside the
bamboo screen, burst into the room and shouted:

“Bravo! The latest amusement—the death dance!”

The dancing, singing and hopping stopped dead, and the rev-
ellers stood transfixed with surprise. Just at that moment the
silence was shattered by the mingled sounds of sonas, flutes
and trumpets as the funeral musie struck up: the shrouding had
at last begun. Chu Yin-chiu jumped up and led the way out,
shouting as he ran:

“Come on, everybody! They’ve started.”

They all rushed out behind him, including Chou Chung-wei,
who had forgotten that he still had the lady’s shoes on his head,
while Hsu Man-li stamped her bare feet on the billiard-table and
shouted for help. The colonel, seeing an opportunity of dis-
playing his gallantry, snatched her up in his arms and followed
the crowd as far as the greenhouse, where he retrieved her
dainty little shoes for her.

*

When the party from the billiard-room reached the house they
found the front steps packed with people. The trees were hung
with white paper lanterns which shed a mournful yellowish
light amid the greenery and the sky was so overcast that it
seemed like evening.

The trumpets were hooting and screeching away so weirdly
that they set one’s teeth on edge. An attendant with a large
bundle of burning incense in his hand, seeing Chu Yin-chiu’s
party crowding up, began distributing a stick to each of them.

Fan Po-wen took one and immediately let it drop to the ground,
then, seeing a gap in the crowd, he pushed his way in. Wu
Chih-sheng followed him, brandishing his incense-stick to clear a
way.

Tang Yun-shan craned his neck to look round, then winked at
Sun Chi-jen over his shoulder and said, “What are we waiting
here for?”

“What about going back to the other place?”

“No, but we can-cut through the asphalt path round the back
way to the dining-room,” suggested Chou Chung-wei, looking to
Wang Ho-fu and Chen Chun-yi for support.

“Have you noticed? Someone's missing: the colonel and the
young lady!” said Chu Yin-chiu with a wink, but his voice was
drowned by an even louder blast of funeral music. Chen Chun-
yi pulled him along as he followed Chou Chung-wei and the
others when they cut through the veranda in front of the dining-
room. As they passed the trellis with the banksia roses they
spotted Col. Lei and Hsu Man-li emerging from a grove and
hurrying towards the funeral hall.

They found the dining-room empty, as they had expected,
and the door leading to the funeral hall was closed. The moment
Chou Chung-wei opened it a little he was greeted by a combined
blast of trumpets, sonas and flutes, reinforced by the weeping
and wailing of the mourners. He was surprised to find right
under his nose a coffin and a heap of funeral paraphernalia. He
quickly closed the door again and turned and shook his head.

“I think we’d better stay where we are. What does it matter
if there’s a wall in between?”

As he said this, he collected all the incense-sticks and without
ceremony stuck them into a decorative Foochow lacquered vase
on the table, then sank his bulky frame into a sofa. For a while
everybody was silent.

Chu Yin-chiu, sitting opposite Chou Chung-wei, puffed away
furiously at a Garrick, his eyes closed as if he were thinking
hard. Then he suddenly opened them at Chen Chun-yi and
said, “If people can’t collect their accounts by the end of the
quarter, it’s all because of the war. Everybody’s in the same
boat. Surely the local banks you deal with can help you out a
bit?”

“As a matter of fact, I’ve been to see them about it time and
again. They only say money is tight and so on and so forth.
It’s infuriating. ... I think I might approach Tu Chu-chai later
on; perhaps he’ll help me out,” answered Chen Chun-yi with a
sigh. He saw in his mind’s eye the ugly, half-dead faces of the
bank managers who had refused him loans, and beside them the
bland goat-like face of Tu Chu-chai; he felt the latter held a
ray of hope for him. But Chu Yin-chiu said coldly and scepti-
cally, with a shake of his head:

“Tu Chu-chai?—Oh!”

“Yes, and what of it? Don’t you think there’s any hope
there? I only need a small sum—even a hundred and twenty
or thirty thousand dollars would do,” said Chen Chun-yi hastily,
watching Chu Yin-chiu’s face. Before the latter could answer,
Chou Chung-wei chimed in:

“A hundred and twenty or thirty thousand? You call that
a small sum? I need only fifty or sixty thousand, and I can’t
even get that. Whenever we factory owners call on the bankers,
all we get is scowls. But that’s not surprising, really, when
you come to think about it: they naturally prefer to use their
capital to buy government securities. One day’s work on the
Exchange and they’ve made a hundred thousand dollars. And
that’s mere chicken-feed to them.”

“That’s perfectly true,” said Tang Yun-shan. “You couldn’t
say fairer than that. And that’s why I always say that the root
of the trouble is that the government’s off the rails. Once it
gets on the right track, all government bonds will go to devel-
oping industry. Then finance and industry will really co-
operate, which is more than they do now, when all the financiers
are interested in is profits. But to bring stability into politics
you can’t merely depend upon military men. The men who run
the industries, the industrial capitalists, should bring their in-
fluence to bear upon politics.”

Tang Yun-shan was never slow in seizing an opportunity of
making propaganda for the party he supported. He had always
shown solicitude about industrialists, big or small, and known
how to deal with them. Even though his arguments had been
heard again and again, he never tired of harping upon them
once more whenever the opportunity presented itself. And his
invariable conclusion was: “Our Mr. Wang Ching-wei* is
strongly advocating democracy and genuinely wants to devel-
op China’s industries. China has plenty of money for industry,
but military expenses eat it up.” As Wu Sun-fu shared this
point of view, a close friendship had lately sprung up between
him and Tang Yun-shan.

They had to cut short their conversation when from the funeral
hall there came an ear-splitting din of funeral music and wail-

* Wang Ching-wei, see footnote, p. 47.

ing, punctuated by a loud hammering on some wooden object.
The noise continued, but gradually they got used to it and picked
up the thread of their conversation again.

Distracted by worries about the financial settlement coming
with the Dragon-boat Festival, Chu Yin-chiu regarded Tang Yun-
shan’s ideas as sound, but they did not really have any bearing
on his own personal problem, which was simply how to carry
over his security loans so that he would not have to sell his
silk at a painfully cheap price, and so that he would be able
to keep his factory running at the same time. In a word, his
problem was to obtain ready cash. Though his debts amounted
to over a hundred thousand dollars, he had in hand two hundred
bales of fine and coarse silk and a large stock of cocoons. On
balance, he was not in debt. His creditors had no need to be
worried about their money, but you’d think he hadn’t a penny
to his name the way they kept pressing for repayment. ‘

Chu Yin-chiu felt irked as he thought about all this. He was
sure the bankers had a particular aversion to him, and Tang
Yun-shan’s ideas didn’t help him solve his problems. He snorted
and said icily:

“Mr. Tang, whatever you may say, I’m sure the people who
go in for gold and government bonds have a special sort of
conscience. Even if the government issues bonds earmarked for
industry, do you think they’ll be enthusiastic about buying them?
No, of course they won’t. The main part of a bank’s business
is investment. Subscriptions to bonds are investments of one
kind. If they give us a loan, we offer them a security and pay
them interest, don’t we? But they still won’t raise a finger to
help. So I say they’ve a queer sort of conscience... .”

“ta, ha, ha, ha! .. .”

Chou Chung-wei’s laughter broke in upon Chu Yin-chiu’s
grumbling. The short, fat fellow sprang up and placed himself
between Tang Yun-shan and Chu Yin-chiu with arms outspread
as if trying to separate two brawlers.

“Now, now! Stop bickering,” he boomed. “No businessman
will ever miss an opportunity to make money—the more, the
better. Mr. Chu has his difficulties and the bankers have
theirs... .”

“I agree with you there,” broke in Tang Yun-shan, seeing
a chance to back up his argument. “The greater part of the
bankers’ capital is locked up in government bonds. Whenever
the bonds fall, the bankers get a nasty jolt, find themselves in
urgent need of cash. ... For instance, Mr. Chu’s creditors
are now calling their loans. That’s why I say all the trouble’s
caused by the unstable political situation.”

“Mr. Sun Chi-jen’s just suggested something,” continued Chou
Chung-wei. “It’s a wonderful idea, a very sound idea, indeed.
And he isn’t joking, either.”

As he said this, his face became red with excitement and ‘his
voice rose and made everyone look round. Tang Yun-shan and
Chu Yin-chiu turned to Sun Chi-jen expectantly.

“Come on, Mr. Sun,” urged Chen Chun-yi, “tell us all about
it. What do you propose?”

Sun Chi-jen did not reply immediately, but just smiled and
drew slowly at his cigar. Wang Ho-fu, who knew what it was
all about, could hardly wait any longer. Glancing at Sun Chi-
jen for approval, he cleared his throat and outlined the latter’s
“excellent idea”:

“Mr, Sun and I have talked it over several times already.
It’s quite simple, really. It’s like this. We industrialists wiil
club together to set up a bank of our own in order to finance our
own enterprises. At the moment cash is pouring into Shanghai
from further inland; it’s easy enough to sell shares, and we
should have no trouble getting deposits. With a million dollars
capital and a million or two in deposits, we could easily make
a go of it. If we get permission to issue banknotes later on, so
much the better. . .. Well, that’s the gist of it. We've only
talked about it so far: we haven’t actually done anything about
putting the idea into operation yet. Now that Mr. Chou’s let
the cat out of the bag, I suppose we’d better talk it over.”

Wang Ho-fu, though he had a naturally loud voice, purposely
kept it down. What with this and the terrible din from the next
room, everybody had to strain their ears to hear what he was
saying. Actually, the idea was “quite simple.” It was not that
the idea itself was new: some industrialists had done it before.
What was new was that Sun Chi-jen was advocating the
collaboration of men of different trades, not just of one trade

—these men, his listeners, for instance, represented widely diver-
gent interests conditioned by their different trades. As they
listened in silence to Wang Ho-fu’s unhurried exposition, their
keen minds quickly grasped this fact and each immediately
began to conjure up visions of his own personal schemes being
realized by such an arrangement. After Wang Ho-fu had
finished, they all sat brooding over his suggestions in silence for
a while.

Then Tang Yun-shan, who was not an industrialist, spoke up:

“Mr. Sun’s plan can’t go wrong so long as it is endorsed by
powerful men and organized on a large scale, I suggest we ap-
proach Wu Sun-fu about it. I don’t think we can do it with-
out him. Don’t you think that’s about the size of it, gentlemen?”

“Yes, that’s it! That’s just what Mr. Sun and I have said
all along,” said Wang Ho-fu in his usual loud voice.

They continued their discussion and gradually got round to
concrete plans. Chen Chun-yi and Chou Chung-wei, who were
not very strong financially themselves, hoped that Sun Chi-jen,
as a shipping manager, and Wang Ho-fu, as a mine owner, had
plenty of capital which they could easily divert to the proposed
enterprise. On the other hand, Sun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu
thought that the other two, being ex-compradores, must have a
decent sum available. But they all pinned their hopes on Wu
Sun-fu, who had long been known for his capital, resourcefulness
and drive. Chu Yin-chiu, though he talked enthusiastically, had
his doubts whether Wu Sun-fu would be willing to come in on
it. He knew that Wu Sun-fu was free from pressure from the
bankers and that he was comfortably off when everyone else
in the silk industry was feeling the pinch. Four or five months
ago, before prices had plunged, hadn’t he managed to clear a
thousand bales in the export market? This had enabled him to
speed up production to meet delivery, while everyone else in
the industry was thinking of closing down for the time being.
But even this happy man had one sorrow: he was short of dry
cocoons. As for new cocoons, it had been a bad season and
quotations were high. Of course, he could use Japanese dry
cocoons, but the Japanese foreign exchange was going up, even
though Japanese cocoons were free from import duty, so that,

on balance, Japanese cocoons were just as dear... . Absorbed in
such calculations as these, Chu Yin-chiu sat pensive and silent.

Suddenly a new idea struck him. He looked at Tang Yun-
shan and caught his eye.

“Mr, Tang,” he said, “to set up a bank would be our salvation,
no doubt; but the government shouldn’t just stand by and watch
industry go downhill when it is on industry that national pros-
perity and the people’s livelihood depend. You’ve just said that
the government should use all money from bonds for the devel-
opment of industry... . Of course, this wouldn’t be practicable
at the moment, but the government could at least issue special
bonds to save a particular branch of industry which happens to
be in distress. What do you think?”

Chu Yin-chiu said this for reasons of his own. He was of
course quite clear about it in his own mind, as he had just spent
quite a while working it all out. But Tang Yun-shan did not
seem to catch on, and before he could answer, the door of the
funeral hall opened and in came Dr. Ting. Rubbing his hands
as usual, the doctor said with a sigh of relief:

“Jt’s finished now. The International Undertakers have done
a good job. Now that they’ve done the colouring, Old Mr. Wu
lies in his coffin as if he were asleep. His face looks flushed... .
Why, it’s half past three already!”

Just then two servants came in with platefuls of refresh-
ments: lemonade, ice-cream, iced almond-jelly, fruit consommé,
cream layer-cakes, and all sorts of foreign-style delicacies. The
table was laden with eatables, and all conversation was sus-
pended while the guests attacked them.

Dr. Ting ran his eyes over the table but shook his head and
refused to touch anything. He was quite well-known as a
stickler for wholesome food. Tang Yun-shan was about to tease
him, when the other door of the dining-room opened and a maid
looked in and said, “Could you spare a moment, Doctor?” Mrs.
Wu Sun-fu was not feeling well. As Dr. Ting hurried off, Wu
Sun-fu came in from the drawing-room to thank the mourners
for coming. Seeing him come in, Tang Yun-shan quickly put
down his half-eaten cake and cried excitedly, “Ah, you’ve
come just right, Sun-fu! We want your opinion about an im-

portant scheme. It was suggested by Mr. Sun Chi-jen and Mr.
Wang Ho-fu here.”

The two men smiled modestly and outlined their plan. Jerking
his thumb towards Tang Yun-shan, Wang Ho-fu laughed and
added, “We have only been toying with the idea. We hardly
expected that Mr. Tang would bother you with it. You’ve had
a tiring day, but if you’re interested, we can talk about it some
other time.”

“Now’s the time!” protested Tang Yun-shan. “Sun-fu is never
tired when he is keen on something.”

It seemed that he was more enthusiastic about it than anyone
else. As he ushered people into the other section of the dining-
room he rubbed in once more his theory on industrialists’ unity
as a condition of political stability. He maintained that if the
industrialists had their own bank, that constituted an important
step towards their unity.

Withholding his opinion for the moment, Wu Sun-fu listened
to Tang Yun-shan holding forth. He knew only too well about
the financial standing and abilities of these industrialists before
him. There was not much they could do on their own. As
for himself, he was not one to underestimate himself. If he
went in with them, things would take on a new look, for he had
the knack of making ordinary men into men of ability. Only
he was not sure at the moment whether these men would unani-
mously proclaim him their leader. As he pondered, he ran his
keen gaze over them to observe the expression on their faces.
Seeing that only Chu Yin-chiu was comparatively indifferent and
reserved, he took advantage of a lull in the general conversation
to ask him:

“What do you think of the plan, Mr. Chu? At the present
moment, we silk manufacturers are having difficulties all round.
It has always been my hope that one day just such a bank should
be organized to help keep industry on a more even keel.”

“Mr. Wu, you’re being too modest in asking for my opinion.
We're all old friends here and know all about each other. At the
moment only you have the necessary resources to get things
going, so we naturally look to you to help us out.”

Chu Yin-chiu sounded sincere enough, and Chen Chun-yi and
Chou Chung-wei were the first to clap their hands in approval.

But Wu Sun-fu frowned as it dawned upon him that these three
men’s idea was not to subscribe for shares in the projected bank,
but to get someone else to finance it and supply them with
generous loans. Wu Sun-fu was about to reply, when Sun Chi-
jen interjected:

“Let’s be quite frank about it. My idea is essentially to set
up a bank to finance a few specific industries. The usual run
of bankers absorbs deposits and speculates in land, gold and gov-
ernment bonds. The most they do for industrialists is to make
them occasional loans on securities. But if we set up this bank,
we'll go all out to support a few of the more hopeful industries,
such as the long-distance coach services in North Kiangsu and
the mines in Honan. As for helping out those industries which
are stranded at the moment, that’ll only be one of our minor func-
tions.... I am all for the scheme myself; the only trouble is
that I haven’t the resources.”

Chen Chun-yi and Chou Chung-wei looked at each other in
consternation: they never thought Sun Chi-jen would keep a
scheme like this up his sleeve all this time before mentioning
it. Since they did not feel that any good could ever come of
it for them, their enthusiasm began to cool off. Chu Yin-chiu
smiled grimly, knowing only too well that Sun Chi-jen’s pro-
posal for a bank to finance buses and mines was just “a lot of
eyewash.” Chu Yin-chiu was very good at guessing other peo-
ple’s thoughts by his own.

However, Wu Sun-fu’s eyes gleamed with excitement, for Sun
Chi-jen was a comparatively new acquaintance, and Wu Sun-fu
had hardly expected that this man with his small head and long
neck would turn out to be so far-sighted and unconventional.
He felt that he had at last found a fine man after his own heart.
Wu Sun-fu himself was ambitious, adventurous and plucky, and
he naturally preferred to work with men of his own calibre. He
hated to see good industries go to rack and ruin in the hands of
inexperienced, inefficient, timorous or mediocre men, and when-
ever he came across such bunglers, he wanted to cut them down
without mercy and take their enterprises into his own iron hand.

His keen gaze searching Sun Chi-jen’s face, Wu Sun-fu nodded
thoughtfully. Now he wanted to see whether Wang Ho-fu was

equally go-ahead. He turned to Wang Ho-fu on his left and asked
deliberately, “What’s your opinion, Mr. Wang?”

“On the whole I agree with Mr. Sun; but whatever we aim at
eventually, we should keep our plans fairly flexible at first. With
things as they are at the moment, I don’t think we can expect
people to subscribe for shares in a bank set up for the express
purpose of financing new enterprises. I think we should run
it as an ordinary bank in the beginning.”

Wang Ho-fu spoke with his usual bantering smile, which con-
trasted strongly with Sun Chi-jen’s reticence and taciturnity.
Northerner as he was, Wang Ho-fu combined a humorous dis-
position with a great tenacity of purpose.

Wu Sun-fu smiled and struck the arm of his chair with two
fingers.

“Done!” he said resolutely. “When you two gentlemen lead
the way, I’ll follow.”

“You’re joking, Mr. Wu. It’s for us two to follow your lead.”

“Ah! You three make a good trio!” interrupted Tang Yun-
shan, slapping his thigh and laughing noisily, “you see eye to
eye and you’re evenly matched in strength and skill. Here’s an
eternal triangle which will succeed!”

He quickly suppressed his mirth and suggested seriously, “As
far as I can see, you three should start organizing a consortium.

As he said this, he turned to Chu Yin-chiu and the other two
in case they should feel out of it. “Do you agree with me, gentle-
men? And all those who are here now will be the promoters.”

These three men, who had been listening in silence, had ex-
pected that Wu Sun-fu would reject Sun Chi-jen’s wild scheme.
Now things had turned out just to the contrary. On top of that
Tang Yun-shan was pressing them to come in. For the moment
they did not know what to say, for, apart from the fact that
they had no capital to spare at the moment, even if they could
obtain some, they would prefer to wait and see before plunging
into such an ambitious scheme.

The conversation had taken a slightly embarrassing turn, but
they were saved by the arrival of the butler Kao Sheng.

“Mr. Tu would like to see you, sir,” he said to Wu Sun-fu.
“He's waiting in the small drawing-room.”

Wu Sun-fu, apparently guessing what it was about, excused
himself and went out, but Chu Yin-chiu caught up with him in
the doorway and blurted out:

“you know I’ve a security loan from Mr. Tu Chu-chai, which
is due very soon. I wonder if you’d be good enough to put in
a word for me?”

Wu Sun-fu avoided his eye but, before he could answer, Chu
Yin-chiu went on, “Just three months’ grace. That will do.”

“But you know I spoke to him about it only the day before
yesterday. We're all good friends and ought to help each other
out when we can. But so far as I can see, he’s in a tight spot
himself at the moment. Money is tight, and he’s afraid that
things may turn for the worse, so he’s calling all loans as they
fall due. You aren’t the only one involved... .”

“In that case there’s only one way open to me: I'll have to
go bankrupt!”

Chu Yin-chiu said this in such an earnest tone that Wu Sun-
fu almost believed him. But a sharp glance at his face told
Wu Sun-fu that this was only Chu Yin-chiu’s diplomacy. Rather
than call his bluff, he said coldly, “It would hardly come to
that. Your assets exceed your liabilities, so how can you talk
about going bankrupt?”

“Then the only alternative is that I close down for three
months.”

At this Wu Sun-fu could scarcely conceal his annoyance, for
he knew very well that just now every silk factory was like
a powder-magazine: it needed only a single spark to set the place
ablaze and lead to a general strike throughout the industry. The
last thing he wanted was a strike on his hands just when he
was speeding up production to meet a contract. Chu Yin-chiu,
of course, was aware of all this, and his talk of “closing down
for three months” was nothing but a threat. After a moment's
hesitation, Wu Sun-fu adopted a different tone.

“T'll do my best for you, anyway. I'll let you know the result
later on.”

Then, before Chu Yin-chiu could involve him any deeper, Wu
Sun-fu made good his escape, a malicious smile on his lips.

ca

Tu Chu-chai was waiting impatiently in the drawing-room. He

had been taking a large quantity of snuff and sneezed twice.
He wandered absent-mindedly over to the door and glanced out
just in time to see Wu Sun-fu escape from Chu Yin-chiu. The
mixture of anger and misery in his face surprised Tu Chu-chai,
who supposed that there had been trouble in Wu Sun-fun’s fac-
tory or that another telegram had come from the country.

“What's the matter?” he inquired hurriedly, stepping forward.
“More trouble?”

Wu Sun-fu smiled bitterly but did not reply. He closed the
door and threw himself down wearily on to a sofa.

“Life’s just one long battle,” he said. “We’re walking over a
mine field. At any moment you may be blown to pieces!”

Tu Chu-chai paled at what seemed to be a confirmation of his
fears. But Wu Sun-fu’s manner suddenly changed and he smiled
bitterly.

“So that so-and-so Chu Yin-chiu thinks he can play tricks on
me, too, eh?” he said with assumed unconcern. “Hal”

“Oh, Chu Yin-chiu, is it?”

Tu Chu-chai felt relieved and sneezed violently.

“Yes, him. The one you saw just now. He wants you to
extend your loan for another three months... or rather, at
least three months, by the tone of his voice. Apart from that,
he thinks he can play a mean trick on me— says he’ll go bank-
rupt or close down his factory. He’s trying to intimidate me.
He takes us for a pack of fools that he can monkey about with
as he likes.”

“T see ... and what did you say to him?”

“1 said I would see him later.... But, Chu-chai, are you
going to give him a further extension?”

“If he absolutely refuses to settle up, there’s nothing I can do
about it. It isn’t much, though— only eighty thousand dollars,
and I hold his pledge: a hundred and fifty bales of medium-
grade dry silk... .”

Before he could finish, Wu Sun-fu jumped up and paced up
and down like a hungry caged lion, then sat down again and
settled himself lower into the sofa.

“Why bother with him?” he asked sardonically, shaking his
head. “You aren’t a charitable institution, and you shouldn’t
let him take advantage of you.— You don’t really believe he’s

short of money, do you? Well, he’s not. He’s just mean, mean
and stupid, and if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s a man
who’s mean and stupid at the same time. I remember some time
ago he refused to sell his B-grade silk when the price was nine
hundred taels and good enough to cover the cost. Pure mean-
ness! Later on, the price dropped to eight hundred and fifty
taels. He imagined it would go up again, and, instead of selling,
bought in fifty bales of Szechuan silk. That will show you how
stupid he is, though he wouldn’t have done such a stupid thing
if he hadn’t been so mean. He’s just not fit to be in business!
And he can’t manage his factory properly, either. The silk from
his factory is very poor—full of hairs. He is ruining the rep-
utation of the whole silk industry. It’s a crying shame that
a man like that should have all those first-class new Italian
machines! .. .”

“What are we to do, then?” interrupted Tu Chu-chai, who was
totally ignorant of factory management and was getting impa-
tient.

“What are we to do? Let him have another seventy thousand
to make it up to a hundred and fifty thousand.”

“What? Another seventy thousand?”

Tu Chu-chai was so startled that he spilt a pinch of snuff all
over his lap.

“Yes, 1 said seventy thousand dollars,” said Wu Sun-fu, smil-
ing. “But I don’t mean you should extend the old loan of eighty
thousand and give him a new loan of seventy thousand on
top of that. He must still pay off the old loan when it falls due.
What we shall do is to give him a new security loan of a hun-
dred and fifty thousand dollars and deduct the old loan of eighty
thousand plus an interest... .”

“I really don’t understand why we have to go about it in such
a round-about way. All Chu Yin-chiu wants is that the old loan
should be extended, isn’t it?”

“Look here, old man! It’s like this. The new loan of a hun-
dred and fifty thousand dollars would be for one month only.
As for the pledge, we won’t accept any kind of silk, finished,
raw, or mixed. We'll accept only dry cocoons. And the agree-
ment will be that in case of default the creditor shall have the
right to: foreclose.... And, besides, you will act only as a

middleman and nothing more. We'll say that the new loan’s
to be negotiated with a certain consortium and that you'll be
glad to recommend him.”

Wu Sun-fu stopped and fixed his sharp eyes unwaveringly on
Tu Chu-chai’s goat-like face. He knew that this elder brother-
in-law of his was at once suspicious and avaricious and that he
could never be straightforward and commit himself to anything.
Wu Sun-fu was now quietly waiting for Tu Chu-chai to work
things out. Meanwhile, he fell to imagining Chu Yin-chiu’s
cocoons tumbling into his lap in a month’s time. And perhaps
in due course of time —say, three or four months’ time — even
those new Italian machines might come under his own efficient
and careful management.

Just then the door of the small drawing-room opened and in
came Mrs. Wu Sun-fu, looking rather out of sorts. She sat down
quietly in a chair opposite Wu Sun-fu and looked at him as if
she had something to say. He remembered that a short while
before she had complained of a pain in the chest and had sent
for the doctor. Just as he was going to ask her how she was,
Tu Chu-chai stood up, sneezed and said:

“All right, Vll do as you say.... But, Sun-fu, are you sure
his cocoons will make a good enough pledge? What if they
don’t come to the hundred and fifty thousand dollars?”

Wu Sun-fu burst out laughing.

“Chu-chai,” he said, “are you really afraid the pledge’s not
worth that much? I’m only afraid Chu Yin-chiu won’t want
to part with his cocoons. I expect they will cease to be his in
a month’s time, unless he acquires the touch of Midas by then,
and then we'll see once more what a fool the man is. Anyway,
why is he hoarding nearly two hundred thousand dollars’ worth
of cocoons in that little factory of his? He bought up so many
last year that the prices soared and the rest of us were the
losers. It’s high time someone relieved him of his cocoons.”

“Oh, what a snake you are!” exclaimed his wife, her haggard
face lighting up with a dazzling smile.

The two men looked at each other and burst out laughing.

“That’s settled, then. ... There was something else I wanted
to see you about —oh, yes: Chao Po-tao rang me up to tell me
he’d taken the first step. About the second step, there’s ap-

parently been an unexpected change in the market, so we’ll have
to work out a different approach. He’s waiting for us in the
Cathay Hotel... .”

“Then let’s go,” said Wu Sun-fu briskly. “We can discuss the
consortium idea in the car.”

The two of them went out of the drawing-room and after a
moment the car could be heard starting up outside of the window.

Left alone, Mrs. Wu Sun-fu gave herself up to day-dreaming
and let her thoughts wander. The sound of the car took her
back seven or eight years to when she was still Miss Lin Pei-yao,
a student at the missionary school, to the time when, for the
first time in her young life, she had gone for an outing in a car
with some of her school friends — girls in their teens who never
dreamed that the wine of youth would one day be. drained dry.
Their heads were full of visions of valiant knights and handsome
princes from Ivanhoe and The Tempest and of the realm of poesy
with its islands, its ancient castles, its great forests and its
moonlit balconies. Their school, hidden away as it was on the
edge of a spacious park outside the city, seemed to them just
such an enchanted land, and there they used to dream their rosy
dreams of the future. She herself, Miss Lin Pei-yao, endowed
with her scholarly father’s idealistic temperament, was especially
fond of building castles in the air, and on many a balmy, moonlit
night she would lie awake with starry eyes, enjoying the beauti-
ful dreams her imagination conjured up.

But these “midsummer night’s dreams” of hers were destined,
as such dreams always are, to be short-lived. Her father died
after a short illness, and her mother did not long survive him.
The realities of life were beginning to invade her virgin heart.
Then, just when her whole world had crumbled about her ears,
another kind of “tempest,” as heroic and tragic as the other,
claimed her attention: the stirring movement against the Thir-
tieth of May Massacre.* There suddenly came into her life a

*On May 30, 1925, the students and workers of Shanghai held a
demonstration in the International Settlement to protest against the
killing of a Chinese worker Ku Cheng-hung by the management of
a Japanese cotton mill in Shanghai for his part in organizing a strike.
The British police in the Settlement opened fire on the demonstrators,
inflicting heavy casualties. This atrocity gave rise to a country-wide
anti-imperialist movement.

young man who to her eyes seemed like a knight from the Age
of Chivalry. She was frightened and delighted. Then this
young man, who had flashed through her life like a comet, sud-
denly disappeared and left her heart-broken.

And after that she had—

At this point in her reverie she shivered and came to with a
start. She jerked up her head as if startled and looked all
round. The entire room was as luxuriously and fashionably
furnished as any woman could wish: large oil paintings on the
walls, curios on the sideboard, vases of flowers, expensive fur-
niture and, in addition to all this, a parrot in a cage. Never-
theless, Mrs. Wu Sun-fu felt something was missing. Ever since
she had become mistress of this house, this feeling that there
was “something missing” had been preying on her mind on and
off.

In her student days she had filled her mind with idealistic
images from the English classics which she had never since been
able to forget. During these past few years she had come to
know something of the realities of life, but they had not yet
made her realize that her husky, strong-willed husband, with
his purplish, pimply face, was one of the knights or princes of
the twentieth-century industrial world. These industrial knights
and princes might not be able to fence and ride like the knights
and princes of the olden days, but they could do wonderful cal-
culations on the abacus and drive motorcars. But Mrs. Wu Sun-
fu could not appreciate this, nor could she come to realize that
she herself was far from being a mediaeval “lady fayre.”

“Visitor!” croaked the parrot, startling Mrs. Wu Sun-fu out of
her day-dream. Standing in the doorway was an upstanding
young man in uniform, a suspicion of a smile on his handsome,
dignified face and a twinkle in his eye ~ Col. Lei!

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu looked up with a start: for a split second
dream and reality had merged into one in her mind. She could
hardly believe her eyes. Col. Lei bowed and came over to her,
the sound of his measured tread finally bringing her back to
earth. At the same time, her innate sense of duty and polite-
ness immediately took possession of her again and she put on
a smile and rose to greet him.

“Why, it’s Col. Leif! Do take a seat.... You wanted to see
Sun-fu? He’s just gone out.”

“Yes, I saw him go, madame,” he replied in a soft, courteous
voice. “He asked me to stay to dinner.”

Instead of sitting down, he remained standing about a yard
away from her, his bright eyes searching her rather bewildered
face.

She instinctively smiled and stepped backwards to sit down
again on the sofa.

Fot a moment neither of them spoke, and there was an
awkward silence.

Col, Lei dropped his eyes from Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face to stare
at the floor, trembling slightly. Suddenly he thrust his right
hand into his pocket, stepped forward, his head still bowed,
and blurted out:

“Madame Wu, I’m leaving for the front tomorrow morning.
There’s hardly any chance of my coming out of it alive. So
this is the last time I shall see you, the last time I shall be able
to speak to you. Madame Wu, I have something here I'd like
to give you.”

He lifted his head again and drew his hand out of his pocket.
It was a book. He flicked it open in the middle and offered
it to her with both hands.

It was a tattered old copy of The Sorrows of Young Werther
in Chinese, and between the pages was a faded white rose.

Memories of the stormy “Thirtieth of May Movement” launched
by the students of Shanghai came flooding back when she saw
this tattered book and its faded rose, making her tremble from
head to foot. She snatched the book from his hands and stared
at him, speechless with emotion.

Col. Lei forced a smile and seemed to sigh. “Madame Wu,”
he went on, “you may regard the book and the rose as.a gift from
me, or, if you like, as something you are looking after for me.
You see, my parents are dead and I have no brothers or sisters,
and practically no close friends. There is only one thing I’ve
treasured all my life: this book with its faded rose. Before I
go to the front I want to give these treasures to the person I

”

trust most. ...

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu let out a sudden cry and her face flushed.

Col. Lei paused a second, then went on urgently and insistently:

“Madame Wu, I’ve chosen you to look after them, and I hope
you won't refuse them. I can never for one moment forget
how I came by the book and the rose. One evening five years
ago, an evening just like this, a close, muggy evening, I received
this flower from the hand of a most dignified, noble, and lovely
lady — my reward for my adoration of her. This book The Sor-
rows of Young Werther has witnessed our — Madame Wu, I hope
you won’t mind if I say—our love? But, poor student that I
was, I dared not hope... circumstances would not permit it.
Madame Wu, you must have seen that. And then... you must
see now why I suddenly ran away from the angel I worshipped.
I went to Canton and entered the Whampoa Military Academy.
Later, I followed the colours from Kwangtung to Peking and
rose from company commander to regimental commander. I
crawled in and out of piles of corpses, was nearly killed several
times and I lost everything except this book and this rose, which
I never parted with for one moment. But after I’d escaped
from the jaws of death, what did I find when I got back! I
searched Shanghai for six months and more before I found my
luck was out. Now my hopes are dead and my courage is gone.
Madame Wu, I’m going to battle again— this time to die. But
I can’t let this book and this rose be shattered to pieces on the
battlefield. Now I’ve found the right person to look after this
tattered book and this faded rose for me... .”

Col. Lei’s voice shook, and beads of perspiration broke out on
his forehead. He took a deep breath and sank on to a nearby
chair. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face had turned pale from red and she
gazed at him dumbfounded.

Col. Lei smiled bitterly and suddenly straightened up as if
torn by some inner conflict. He stood up abruptly and went up
to her again.

“Madame Wu,” he said slowly and hoarsely, “I’m glad I’ve had
the opportunity of telling you all this. Now I can die content.”

He raised his hand in a salute and turned to go.

“Lei Ming! Oh, Lei Ming!”

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu had sprung up and called after him in a
quavering voice.

Col. Lei stopped in his tracks and wheeled round. But she
had nothing to say to him. Her face crimsoned, her eyes swam
and her chest heaved violently. Suddenly she stretched out her
arms; Col. Lei ran to her and she threw herself into his arms
and buried her face in his shoulder. Col. Lei bent his head and
their lips came together.

“My dear!” squawked the parrot, startling them out of their
embrace. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu started as if woken from a dream and
pushed Col. Lei away; then, clutching the book to her breast,
she ran out and upstairs to her room, where she flung herself on
the bed. Soon the white embroidered pillowcase was wet with
her hot tears.

ON the afternoon of Old Mr. Wu’s funeral, in the tovn of
Shuangchiao, about seventy miles from Shanghai, Tseng Tsang-
hai, Wu Sun-fu’s uncle on his mother’s side, was reclining on an
opium-couch in his large, gloomy house, having one of his
habitual fits of temper.

Now in his fifties, this senior member of the landed gentry
was known in those parts as the “Local King.” Since at the age
of forty, he had had his first and only son, whom he doted on,
his greed, avarice and meanness had become worse than ever.
Unfortunately, the boy was a good-for-nothing, with the result
that his father, who should have been enjoying his retirement
by now, had to continue to manage the household affairs on his
own and even bother himself with such trivialities as getting in
provisions.

Besides, for the last two or three years he had had a run of
bad luck. When for the first time the Kuomintang flag had
flown over the town of Shuangchiao, there had been a great deal
of noisy but serious shouting of such slogans as “Down with the
despotic landlords and gentry!” Greatly alarmed, Tseng Tsang-
hai had fled from the town and gone to stay in Shanghai for a
while. Later, the youngsters who had been responsible for the
disturbance either escaped or were arrested, and Shuangchiao
returned to normal again. But from then on Tseng Tsang-hai’s
régime did not continue to go unchallenged, for another group
of youngsters far from shouting “Down with the landlords!” in-
stalled themselves in the town as “New Nobility” and began to
usurp many of the privileges which Tseng Tsang-hai had enjoyed
exclusively until then. He found it hard to believe that his own
status had been so undermined and reduced. The “New Nobility”
not only had as much say in the running of the town as he did,

but even seemed quite anxious to oust him completely. Whenever
he was thwarted by them he would grumble, “When you’re old
you’re treated as a back number.” His only consolation was a
rather forlorn hope about his son’s future.

This afternoon, Tseng Tsang-hai was fuming on his. opium-
couch, not because he was being hounded by the “New Nobility”
again, but because the telegram from Wu Sun-fu announcing the
death of his father had arrived much too late. When the tele-
gram was put into his hand, he had been overjoyed to see that
it was from his nephew, a famous man in Shanghai who was
always getting his name in the papers, He had thought the
telegram must be some urgent message from his nephew seeking
his advice. The fact that even his important nephew looked to
him for advice put him in a different category altogether from
the “New Nobility” who only yesterday had been a pack of sniv-
elling young puppies. But when the telegram turned out to be
an obituary notice, his spirits sank. He was furious. What an-
noyed him was that this was nothing more than a commonplace
notice of death, instead of some important matter requiring his
advice—it was not the sort of thing he could carry around in
his pocket to show to people and brag about. And then the
telegram had been delivered appallingly late. On top of that,
his nephew had failed to show him the courtesy due to an uncle:
he had sent only an ordinary telegram—and even that only as
a matter of form—instead of a specially chartered boat to fetch
him to Shanghai. In his bygone days of power and prestige he
would, under similar circumstances, have given the telegraph
office hell for the delay, but, as it was, he was now an old man
who did not count for much and there was nothing he could do
except fume and rage in silence.

Suddenly he scrambled off his opium-couch and paced up and
down. He took the telegram to the window where the light was
better and perused it carefully once more. His anger flared up
again and he felt an overwhelming urge to go and storm at the
“muddlers” at the telegraph office, when his labourer Ah Erh
came in perspiring and spattered with mud. Finding his master
in an ugly mood, Ah Erh just stood back panting noisily.

“Ah, you're back, eh? I was thinking that Chilichiao Village
had been shifted during the night so that you couldn’t find it!

I was just going to report you missing to the police. ... You'd
better watch your step! If you carry on the way you're going,
you'll find yourself in prison one of these days!”

As Tseng Tsang-hai pronounced this threat, he tilted his head
on one side and glared at Ah Erh. He always launched into a
tirade like this whenever Ah Erh came home: late from an
errand, though he would never have done anything about it.
But, this time, Ah Erh had the bad luck to walk in just when
his master was boiling with rage. Then Tseng Tsang-hai really
lost his temper at the sight of Ah Erh standing there just pant-
ing and mopping his face instead of reporting the result of his
errand at once as he usually did.

“You scoundrel, you!’ shouted Tseng Tsang-hai hoarsely,
stamping his foot. “Speak up, can’t you? How much did you
collect?”

“Not a penny. — They’re having a meeting in the village today
and they were banging gongs everywhere to let people know
about it—”

Ah Erh stopped short and lifted the hem of his blue jacket
to wipe his face once more. As he closed his eyes he could see
several thousand villagers at a meeting with countless red ban-
ners fluttering on their hoes, and several thousand terrible eyes
blazing. His ears instantly rang once more with crashing of
gongs and the angry roar of the crowd. He felt his heart pound-
ing as if it would burst and he went hot and cold all over.

Tseng T'sang-hai had no idea what was going on in Ah Erh’s
mind and Ah Erh’s unusual reticence made him see red.

“To hell with their bloody meeting! Your business was to
collect debts for me. Didn’t you tell them: ‘If you don’t settle
up today, Mr. Tseng’ll send the police round tomorrow and put
you under arrest’? Didn’t you tell the bastards that?7—Meeting
be damned!”

“All right, then: you carry on and send the police! But you
won't see me going there again—not even if you cut off my head.
All the villagers have joined some association. ... The moment
they see me they know what I am there for. They swear at
me and try to keep me there and want me to... .”

There was a note of suppressed defiance in Ah Erh’s voice
and he did not even say “sir.” This was no small offence, but

fortunately Tseng Tsang-hai was too busy worrying about his
uncollected debts to notice it. He cut Ah Erh short with a thump
on the table.

“Blast their association!” he roared. “Chen Lao-pa—I know
he’s a committee member of that confounded peasants’ associa-
tion. He’s a money-lender himself, and he allows them to get
away with their debts to me! I’ll call him to account! I’ve never
heard of such nonsense! Perhaps you’re lying to me, you
scoundrel—I don’t suppose you went near the place! Mark my
words: I'll find out if you didn’t, and you won’t get away with
it...”

“It isn’t Chen Lao-pa’s association. It’s a new one. Nobody
knows about it except the people in the village. People here in
the town haven’t heard about it yet. They had their first meet-
ing this morning—they were beating gongs to call the people up.
There were thousands there—all barefoot and wearing short
jackets; there wasn’t a single gown among them. They’re all
genuine poor villagers. .. .”

Ah Erh had begun his tale gleefully, unabashed by Tseng
Tsang-hai’s threats; but he broke off suddenly when he saw that
his master had gone deathly pale, and that his hands were trem-
bling as he collapsed on to the opium-couch and closed his eyes.
During the ten years that Ah Erh had worked for him, Tseng
Tsang-hai had always seemed a formidable figure, so it came as a
revelation to see him shaken and unnerved like a defeated
fighting-cock.

Ah Erh suddenly wavered. A good-natured fellow at heart,
he could not bear to see his master in such a bad way. If he
were to cause this old opium-smoker to drop dead from fright
it would be a terrible crime! The gods would surely punish him
by cutting short his life! However, he need not have worried,
for Tseng Tsang-hai suddenly opened his bloodshot eyes and
glared fiercely, and his face became livid. He sprang up, seized
the opium-pipe, sprang forward in a rage, and aimed a blow at
Ah Erh’s head.

“You scum, you!” he screamed. “You're as bad as they are!
How dare you lot start a rebellion!”

Crack! ... the long ivory opium-pipe broke in two. It had
missed the labourer’s head altogether, for Ah Ern nad warded It

off with his brawny, sun-tanned arm, but this attack made his
blood boil and he stood his ground with glaring eyes. Still
brandishing the broken half of the pipe and thundering away,
Tseng Tsang-hai snatched up a pewter candlestick and hurled
it at Ah Erh’s face. This, too, went wide of the mark; but when
it hit the ground the sharp spike at the top pierced Ah Erh’s
shin and made it bleed. Ah Erh’s eyes blazed with anger. “Kill
the bloody old fleecer!” the villagers at Chilichiao had shouted,
and this phrase now came back to him with particular vividness,
and made him clench his fists. If Tseng Tsang-hai tried to come
one step nearer, he was more than ready to fight!

Suddenly a pandemonium of cursing and screaming broke out
in another room and the next moment an attractive young
woman burst in upon them, weeping and wailing, and threw
herself on Tseng Tsang-hai, so that the old man was nearly
thrown off balance.

“What's the matter, Ah-chin?” asked Tseng Tsang-hai de-
jectedly, leaning on the table. Hard on the first woman’s heels
came another, tall and sturdy, and immediately the room rang
with their shouting and cursing. Shaking his head and sighing,
Tseng Tsang-hai took refuge on his opium-couch, where he lay
with closed eyes. Although he was known far and wide as an
old hand at manipulating lawsuits, he was utterly helpless when
it came to sorting out the quarrels between these two women—his
daughter-in-law and his unofficial concubine. He had no alterna-
tive but to leave them to it and take no notice.

Ah Erh had slipped out of the room, leaving the two women
screaming abuse at one another while a wet-nurse with Tseng
Tsang-hai’s grandson in her arms and a scullery-maid stood
under the eaves outside, listening and watching. Tseng Tsang-
hai was taking comfort in a sizzling opium-pipe, regretting the
broken ivory pipe and wondering what this new association in
Chilichiao Village was all about. He now felt rather sorry that
he had let himself go like that in front of Ah Erh just now. His
scheming mind was soon busy on another train of thought: So
the Communists are egging the villagers to join an association
and to hold meetings, are they? That means they must have
something big up their sleeve! But there’s nothing to be afraid
of, really: there’s the battalion of regulars in the town, besides

the local security corps. This would be a good opportunity to
get the Bureau of Public Safety to round up some of the Com-
munists and deal with them—and how about calling my debtors
who won't pay up Communists. ... Then another thing: nobody
in the whole town has heard about what’s going on in Chilichiao
Village! These “New Nobility” here who are always trying so
hard to squeeze me out are just asleep! At the thought of the
ignorance of the “New Nobility” Tseng Tsang-hai’s haggard face
lit up with a smile of complacency. He knew now how he
could recover all the debts owing him, principal and interest,
and also how he could expose the incompetence and weakness
of the “New Nobility.” If they had not even heard of the exist-
ence of Communists in the village, what business had they to
be where they were?

“Very well, I'll do it,” he suddenly said aloud. “I’ll teach the
‘New Nobility’ a lesson! Ha, ha!”

Well pleased with himself, Tseng Tsang-hai cackled triumphant-
ly and laid down the opium-pipe. His hoarse voice filled the
room, and not until he heard it himself did he realize that the
women’s brawl had somehow stopped completely. He looked
round in surprise and discovered his concubine sitting at a table
opposite the opium-couch, her face buried in a handkerchief as
if she’ were crying.

“ah-chin!” Tseng Tsang-hai called softly. No answer. He did
not know what to do. He hoisted himself up on the couch and
was intending to go across and say something to soothe her,
when she uncovered her face and glared disdainfully at him. She
had not been weeping at all, though her eyes were red.

“I’m going back home to the country tomorrow,” she shrilled
“I’m not going to stay here to be insulted and ill-treated. What
do you take me for?”

Suddenly she started crying—or rather sobbing, for she shed
no real tears.

“Oh, what do you keep quarrelling with that woman for?
I’ve no time to deal with her. Just wait until Chia-chu comes
home, and then I’! tell him to take his wife in hand. And I'll
tell him to give her a good hiding, and then you’ll be even with
her. Come now, it’s nothing much, really. Don’t take that sort
of woman seriously.... Now, you go and see if my bird’s-

nest porridge is ready. I want to have it straight away, because
I’m going out on urgent business.”

While he was saying this, he walked over and wiped her face
with his loose, opium-stained sleeve, as if to dry her tears, but
she shook her head, looked askance at him and snorted:

“Hm! Do you mean all that?”

“Of course I mean it! When I say someone must be punished,
you can be sure that they will be. I’m master here; I don’t have
to lift a finger—somebody else’ll do it for me. Remember when
your husband came here to make trouble not long ago? I
promised to punish him for you, didn’t I? And didn’t I get the
police to deal with him? This time, it’s a bit different, though:
you can’t very well hand your own daughter-in-law over to the
police. Ill have to get my son to deal with her. He’ll be home
any moment now, and then I'll tell him to give the bitch a good
hiding. And what I say goes.”

“Huh! So what you say goes, does it? What about that gold
ring you promised me last month? You still haven’t—”

“Ah, that’s a different matter, though: that costs money.
—Anyway, what’s the use of a gold ring? You can only wear it
on your finger, but it won’t do you any good there. Wouldn’t it
be much better if I put the money in the bank to earn some
interest for you? Now, run along and see to my porridge, and
when I come home, I’ll give you a passbook for a hundred dol-
lars. Satisfied?”

She apparently was, for she went out looking rather pleased
with herself. He chuckled, gratified by his diplomatic coup. He
returned to his couch and began cheerfully roasting a large bead
of opium.

Hardly had he put the pellet into the bowl of the pipe and
begun drawing at it, when pandemonium broke out again in
the back of the house, this time with a man’s voice adding to the
din: his son Chia-chu had come on the scene. Tseng Tsang-hai
gripped the pipe harder and sucked away at it as if nothing had
happened, when a shrill accusation caught his ear above the
hubbub of cursing and shouting:

“You shameless hussy! The old man can’t satisfy you, so you
go and set your cap at the young one! You don’t imagine I’m
going to let you get away with that, do you?”

The voice was his daughter-in-law’s and was answered by a
laugh from the concubine Ah-chin. Suddenly, the son’s voice
broke in with an angry roar, while his wife sobbed and swore,
and soon the sounds of weeping, cursing and fighting had blurred
into a chaos of noise.

Tseng Tsang-hai stopped smoking. He must try to understand
what she had meant by: “The old man can’t satisfy you!” Al-
though all this was not so important to him as his financial af-
fairs and he could afford to disregard it, nevertheless he felt
rather upset and ill at ease. What perturbed him more was the
idea that his son was quite willing to beat his wife not out of
filial duty and obedience to his father, but for another reason
altogether! Tseng Tsang-hai became quite miserable at his loss
of authority over his son.

Suddenly, heavy footsteps roused him from his reverie. His
son Chia-chu stood before him: an ugly, wild-looking youth of
nineteen. Throwing a book he was holding on to a chair with a
thud and sitting down on a square stool by the couch, he looked
towards his father.

“Chia-chu,” said Tseng Tsang-hai, before his son could open
his mouth, “Old Mr. Wu has died. I had a telegram from your
cousin Sun-fu. You’re free at the moment, so you can go to
Shanghai tomorrow to offer our condolences. — And you can get
your cousin to find you a job while you’re about it.”

He spoke slowly as he put forward the idea he had just worked
out, while his heart contracted at those phrases “the old man...
the young one... satisfy you!”

“I don’t want to go to Shanghai. I’ve some urgent business
on my hands. Give me fifty dollars.”

“What! Money again?” exclaimed Tseng Tsang-hai, rolling
over and sitting up. “Ah, you don’t realize how difficult it is to
make money. ‘Urgent business,’ eh? You’d better tell me ail
about it first.”

Instead of answering his father at once, Chia-chu fumbled in
his pocket and pulled out a black card, which he thrust under
his father’s nose.

“What do I want money for? I’m throwing a party!” he swag-
gered. “Look at this: see what it is?”

Tseng Tsang-hai’s sharp eye and alert mind told him at once
that it was nothing less than a Kuomintang party card! He was
rapturous. He snatched it, rubbed his eyes, and examined it closely
in the light of the opium lamp: yes, it was a party card, right
enough. It had on it his son’s photograph and the inscription:
“Party Membership Card No. 23, so-and-so District... .””"— “So
you rank as high as twenty-third, eh?” the old man muttered
gleefully to himself. He picked up his spectacles from the opium-
plate, settled them on his nose, and carefully examined the party
seal stamped on the card. When he was satisfied, he went over
respectfully to his son and urged him solemnly:

“Look after it, son, and don’t lose it.”

He broke into a happy laugh and patted his-son on the
shoulder.

“So you’re emerging from obscurity at last!” he went on. “T've
always said you won't find a puppy in a tiger’s den! —Give a
party by all means. Have all your friends in this evening to
celebrate. Will fifty dollars be enough? No, Ill give you a
hundred. And then tomorrow night I'll invite my old friends in
as well. Oh, yes, I’ve got something else to tell you. Just a
minute, till I’ve finished this pipe.”

The old man felt triumphant. He lay down on the couch again
and began drawing hard at his pipe. His son was smirking with
satisfaction, but as he couldn’t find anything more to brag about,
he joined his father on the couch and carefully tucked his party
card away in an inside pocket. Both of them treasured this
card, but for quite different reasons. To Chia-chu it was as good
as a passbook with which he could always get plenty of money
to splash around out of the old fool.

When Tseng Tsang-hai had finished his pipe, he picked up the
teapot, put the spout to his lips and gulped down several mouth-
fuls of tea.

“Chia-chu,” he said in a low voice, “I’ve got some important
information for the police. I was planning to go and tell them
myself, but now I think you ought to go instead. Now that you’re
a brand-new party member, you ought to assert your authority
and try your hand at something important and distinguish your-
self! Yes, this is a rare opportunity for you. That’s two strokes
of luck we’ve had today!”

Chia-chu was rather taken aback by the idea of having to go
and see the police, and could only gape and stare foolishly. He
was obviously not at all keen on the idea, and in any case he
would not know how to go about discussing things with the
police.

“Ah, I can well imagine you’ve got stage-fright!” said Tseng
Tsang-hai half reprovingly and half affectionately. He shook his
head, then suddenly changed the subject:

“Chia-chu, have you any idea how many secret opium-dens
there are in the town? Do you know how many men go to see
Mademoiselle San— the girl who lives behind the grocer’s shop
in Chien Street? And do you know how much is smuggled
through the customs barrier every month?”

Tseng Chia-chu just stared, not knowing what to say. As a
matter of fact, he was a regular customer of ladies of the town
like Mademoiselle San, but it was none of his business how many
men they might be entertaining besides himself. As for opium-
dens and smuggled goods, he had never given them a thought.

Tseng Tsang-hai slapped his thigh and laughed happily.

“you don’t know? Naturally a young man dcesn’t bother his
head about such things. But, now you’re a party man— one of
the elite! If you’re going to do your job properly, you must get
to know about local conditions. You should go around and try
to find out about this and that. Information won’t come and
knock at your door. ... However, don’t worry: your old man
knows all the ropes and he’ll soon show you your way around!”

Tseng Chia-chu had turned red in the face, perhaps because
he was ashamed of having his ignorance shown up by his father;
or it may have been that he was becoming impatient because the
hundred dollars had not yet materialized. He pursed his lips
and remained silent. Just then, his wife came in in high dudg-
eon. She sat her child on a chair and put one arm round it,
then turned to her husband as if she were going to say some-
thing, but before she could open her mouth the child started cry-
ing. At the same time it wet itself: the chair was soaked and
some dripped on to the floor.

Chia-chu scowled and screwed up his face with exasperation.
He sat up abruptly on the couch and was just going to rave at

his wife, when he saw that the child was scrabbling his feet
on the book he had just brought in.

“Hey, you little beast!” he roared as he sprang forward and
snatched the book from under the child’s feet. He looked at it:
it was dripping wet and torn beyond recognition. As he pulled
it out the child lost its balance and almost fell off the chair.
Terrified by the realization that it had done something wrong,
it stopped crying and took refuge in its mother’s bosom with its
little mouth wide open.

Tseng Tsang-hai’s expression changed abruptly when he saw
that the soiled book in his son’s hand was no other than The
Three Principles, a theoretical treatise of the Kuomintang. He
sprang off the couch and stamped his foot.

“God Almighty!” he wailed. “Fancy letting the child wet all
over this of all books! If people get to hear about this, there'll
be hell to pay! Oh, God! What a thing to happen!”

The child, terrified, began howling again. Tseng Chia-chu did
not really understand why his father should be making such a
fuss over a book; nevertheless, having a vague idea that some-
thing terrible had happened, he flew into a rage, and suddenly
caught hold of his wife and began thrashing her. As the din
of howling from mother and child and shouting and cursing
from Chia-chu rose about his ears, Tseng Tsang-hai shook his
head and sighed; there was nothing he could do but lie down
and smoke again. After a while he remembered that he had to
go to the police station on important business, so he got up, shook
down his long gown, and departed, leaving the pandemonium
behind him.

*

The streets were crowded as usual. Shuangchiao Town had a
population of nearly a hundred thousand and boasted a few local
banks, pawnshops, silverware shops, as well as a power-house, 2
rice-mill and an oil-refinery owned by Wu Sun-fu. Most of these
establishments had sprung up during the past four or five years.

Tseng Tsang-hai walked with leisurely strides through the
streets, looking at the shops and the modern places of amuse-
ment, thinking that there were now many more opportunities of
making money than in days gone by when he had been the
“Local King.” If he had not had a run of bad luck for the last

two or three years, he would doubtless have made a cool hundred
thousand dollars out of the boom. Although he had a chance of
making a come-back any day now, just the same, he couldn’t
help feeling regretful about what he had missed. He slowed
down and had to stop in front of the Tai Pai Restaurant, so dense
were the crowds.

Suddenly a voice hailed him from behind: “Where are you
off to at such a moment?”

Tseng Tsang-hai glanced over his shoulder, to see Li Sze, the
opium seller. In a way he and the opium-seller were intimate
friends and did not stand on ceremony, but before so many peo-
ple in the street Tseng Tsang-hai was embarrassed by the
familiar manner of this fellow who tugged at his sleeve and called
him just plain “you.” Anybody would think an opium-seller
was the social equal of a man who had always prided himself
on his family and position. It irked Tseng Tsang-hai, but he
could not very well say anything, as he had to reckon with the
fact that Li Sze’s underworld influence was growing daily with
the mounting prosperity of the town. Restrained by this con-
sideration, he had to stifle his displeasure, and, in spite of him-
self, greeted Li Sze with a nod.

“I’m going to the police station,” he replied with a smile, “on
some official business.”

“You'd better turn back,” Li Sze advised him pretentiously.
“Whatever your business, there’s nothing doing today.”

He spoke with a note of arrogance in his voice, as if he were
the superintendent himself.

“Why? Have they got a new superintendent?” asked Tseng
Tsang-hai sarcastically, annoyed at the other’s tone of voice.
Hardly were the words out of his mouth when he regretted it:
he could not afford to offend an influential man like Li Sze.

Luckily, Li Sze did not notice the implication. He led Tseng
Tsang-hai over to a quiet spot across the street, where he put
his mouth to the old man’s ear and whispered:

“Haven’t you heard the news?”

“What news?”

“A Communist detachment’s arrived at Chilichiao Village.
They’re coming to raid the town tonight!”

At this Tseng Tsang-hai’s heart missed a beat and he paled.
He did not mind about there being Communists in Chilichiao and
the news that they were coming to raid the town. What upset
him was that Li Sze had stolen a march on him and that his secret
was a secret no longer! The opportunity of gaining some kudos
for himself or his son had slipped through his fingers. Yet, old
stager that he was, after the initial shock he immediately gather-
ed his wits about him and shook his head in feigned disbelief.

“You don’t believe it?” Li Sze went on in a confidential whisper.
“Listen, I’ll tell you something; there’s hardly anybody knows
about it yet. I heard it from somebody at Colonel Ho’s place.
The colonel’s concubine’s cleared out already. She went on
Pockmarked Wang’s boat. True as I stand here!”

Tseng Tsang-hai’s face was now quite ashen, for he had begun
to realize that the situation was really serious. When earlier
in the day he had heard from his labourer Ah Erh about the
mass meeting in Chilichiao Village and the beating of gongs and
so on, he had dismissed it as something staged by a lot of help-
less, unarmed peasants; but now it looked as if the Communists
were armed and meant business. His fear was now not of some-
one stealing his son’s thunder, but of losing his life and property.

“How many rifles have the Communists got?” he asked
anxiously.

“About a hundred, so I’ve heard.”

Tseng Tsang-hai felt somewhat relieved. Although his plan
for making a name for his son had fallen through, he was
comforted by the thought that there was no real danger. He
smiled and glanced at Li Sze’s cunning face.

“Only a hundred?” he said calmly and unconcernedly. “Nothing
to be afraid of. We've got a whole battalion of troops stationed
here.”

“Yuh! We may have, but they haven’t been paid for three
months.”

“And then there’s the local security force.”

“Fleven out of ten of them opium-addicts!—I should advise
you to be careful, though, and hide up for a while. It’s no joke,
this time. There have been rumours flying about for the past
two days, but of course, you’ve been too busy cuddling your con-
cubine on the couch all day to notice what’s going on outside.

—But it may not be as bad as all that. Though you'd better be
careful and watch out. I don’t mind telling you I’ve given or-
ders for my men all over the town to load their guns in case.
No sleep for them tonight!”

With this Li Sze hurried off.

Tseng Tsang-hai stood cog:tating a while but could not make
up his mind what to do. If he moved.out, it would cost him
a lot of money. Better sit tight for the time being and risk
it. If anything really did happen, and his life and property were
threatened, he could always take his cue from the battalion com-
mander’s concubine and slip away to the county town.. Now that
he had no secret to win himself some glory with, there was no
point in going to see the police superintendent, so he decided to
go home.

There was someone waiting for him in the hall when he ar-
rived home. The moment Tseng Tsang-hai saw that the man
had a little tuft of beard under his chin, he recognized him as
Fei Hsiao-sheng, better known as. Fei Little Beard, Wu Sun-
fu’s agent in the town. :

“Ah, you’re back, Mr. Tseng. I just came to tell you that
Mr. Wu Sun-fu has sent me a wire asking for a hundred thou-
sand dollars to be remitted to him within three days. I should
like your advice.”

When Fei Little Beard came straight to the question of money,
Tseng Tsang-hai’s face fell at once.

“I’ve been looking through the books,” Fei Little Beard went
on with a smile, “and I find that you owe Mr. Sun-fu’s local
bank here some twelve thousand dollars, and that the loan has
long been overdue. I didn’t really want to mention it, but Mr.
Wu sounded very strict in his letter and I haven’t managed to
collect the whole amount, so I have to come and ask you to help
me out. I shall be very grateful for anything you can do to
help.”

Tseng Tsang-hai’s face fell. There was no love lost between
him and the agent. Tseng Tsang-hai had often told people
right and left that Fei Little Beard, during the several years he
had been Wu Sun-fu’s caretaker, had lined his pocket at Wu
Sun-fu’s expense, at the same time doing everything possible
to prejudice his nephew Wu Sun-fu against him, with the result

that all he could get in the way of a loan was a miserable twelve
thousand dollars. Now Fei Little Beard was coming round dun-
ning him and giving himself airs as his master’s agent. Tseng
Tsang-hai, deciding that he ought to be taken down a peg, an-
swered sarcastically:

“You are a good and loyal servant to my nephew, Mr. Fei!
I’ll surely recommend you for promotion.—Now I have some
news that will surprise you: my brother-in-law died soon after
he arrived in Shanghai. I’ve had a telegram from my nephew
asking me to go to Shanghai and supervise the funeral. I’m
leaving tonight. As for the money, I'll see him about it myself,
so you needn’t bother about it now.”

“T see,” said Fei Little Beard, with a faint smile which hinted
that he had seen through Tseng Tsang-hai’s bluff. “I’ve also
received a telegram from Mr. Wu Sun-fu about his father’s
death. But, of course, I didn’t know he’d asked you to go and
supervise the funeral.”

He made no further mention of the money, but rose to go.
He was just about to take his leave when Tseng Tsang-hai
stopped him.

“What's the hurry?” he said. “I’ve got something else to tell
you.—Now, if Sun-fu wants as much as a hundred thousand dol-
lars, it must be for an emergency. Tell me how much you've
collected so far.”

“Only half the required amount, fifty thousand dollars.”

Fei Little Beard sat down again, still wearing a smile, but
implying by his tone of voice that he was not altogether pleased
at Tseng Tsang-hai’s prying. Old fox as he was, Fei Little Beard
knew that Wu Sun-fu had not much respect for his uncle,
but he was still his master’s uncle, and he didn’t dare be too
rude to him. But Tseng Tsang-hai’s high-handed manner was
getting too much for him to stomach. The old man was definite-
ly overreaching himself this time, putting on airs as if he were
somebody of importance.

But, far from toning down his insolent manner, Tseng Tsang-
hai pursued:

“Only fifty thousand? You haven't sent it yet, I suppose?
Well, then, give it to me and I'll take it to Sun-fu myself when
I go.”

Fei’s eyebrows shot up: he could hardly believe his ears.
He tugged at his little beard and stared at Tseng Tsang-hai’s
thin face.

“Go and fetch the money at once,” the latter continued firmly.
“you may hold me responsible for it. Don’t you know about
the Communists in Chilichiao Village? They’re coming to raid
the town this very night. We can’t leave all that money lying
around here tonight; I must take it with me to Shanghai. Sun-
fu’s interests are as important to me as my own. In this emer-
gency I can’t just stand by and see him lose money like that.”

“Oh. . . that! Early this morning I heard the rumour and
sent Mr. Sun-fu a telegram asking for his instructions. If there
should be any trouble tonight, I’ve made arrangements for look-
ing after the money all right. After all, it’s my job and I
shouldn’t like to bother you about it.”

“But could you really bear such a heavy responsibility in an
emergency such as this?”

“Yes, I shall be all right, Mr. Tseng,” Fei Little Beard said
firmly. “Thank you for your kind offer all the same.”

He rose to go, but suddenly sat down again and turned to look
into Tseng Tsang-hai’s face, which betrayed his rage and mor-
tification.

“Mr. Tseng,” he inquired, “where did you get the news that
there’s going to be trouble tonight?”

“Colonel Ho told me so himself, just after he’d received a
secret report, and. . .er. . . it seemed as if Colonel Ho
was a bit scared himself. Do you know who went to the county
town on Pockmarked Wang’s boat this morning?”

“Yes: Colonel Ho’s concubine, going to return a call from
the Magistrate’s wife. —Ah, I see!. . . But I don’t suppose
you’ve heard the news, Mr. Tseng: at two o'clock this afternoon
the colonel told the Chamber of Commerce that he accepted
full responsibility for the defence of the town. But he also said:
‘We haven’t been paid for three months. What about making
up the men’s pay to raise their morale?’ Then he asked them for
a loan of thirty thousand dollars.”

“Did the Chamber of Commerce let him have it?”

“Of course it did—cash down. . . . Ah, it’s getting dark!
I must hurry off.... What time do you leave, Mr. Tseng?

I’m afraid I shan’t be able to see you off on the boat. Please
forgive me.”

Fei Little Beard made a low bow, then made off in great
haste.

Tseng Tsang-hai hypocritically bowed Fei Little Beard out
of the hall, then came back fuming with rage. He paced round
the hall grinding his teeth and groaning. During the past three
hours he had thought up many wonderful plans, but now they
had all fizzled out. He had even failed to get that fifty thou-
sand dollars out of Fei Little Beard. He could not have hated
him more if he had murdered his father.

While searching in his mind for some means of revenge,
Tseng Tsang-hai walked absently along a veranda to the door
of the lounge. Inside, on the opium-couch, a tiny yellow flame
was dancing in the opium-lamp. <As he blundered in, there was
a sudden scuffle and two dark figures sprang up on the couch.
Even in the dim light of the lamp he recognized one of them
as his son and the other as his concubine.

“You swine!” he screamed.

Then suddenly there was a mist before his eyes and he felt
a burning sensation around his heart. As his legs gave way
beneath him, he instinctively felt for a chair and collapsed
weakly on to it, his few straggling wisps of beard twitching
with emotion.

When the mist cleared, Ah-chin was gone and Tseng Chia-chu
was crouching on the couch like a frightened dog, gazing ap-
prehensively at his father.

His son’s incest, Ah-chin’s brazenness, Fei Little Beard’s vil-
lainy, the Communist threat from Chilichiao Village — all these
were seething and churning together in his mind. He wanted
to roar his resentment and reassert himself, but he did not know
quite where to begin. Finally his jealousy got the upper hand,
and he turned on his son.

“you swine!” he raved hoarsely. “If you’re such a glutton,
you might at least go and pick up your women outside: I
wouldn’t mind that. But you’d rather stay at home and have it
on tap, wouldn’t you, you scum? If you put her in the family
way, what are you going to call it—brother or son? That bitch
Ah-chin—”

He was cut short by the crackle of rifle-fire in the distance.
This was the signal for an immediate outburst of prolonged fir-
ing. It was like a firework display on New Year’s Eve. Tseng
Tsang-hai jumped and cried frantically:

“Oh, God! We're done for!—Come on, you young swine, get
outside and see what’s happening, and quick about it! See which
direction they’re coming from and how far away they are!”

But Tseng Chia-chu did not budge; he just cowered down even
lower. Suddenly Ah-chin- rushed in sobbing and wailing, her
dishevelled hair hanging over her face. She clutched hold of
Tseng Tsang-hai and wrapped herself round him like a snake.

“It was your son made me do it!” she sobbed. “I tried to stop
him, but he, he—”

Tseng Tsang-hai knocked her away with a vicious slap in the
face; he was too enraged to say anything. Meanwhile, the sound
of firing was coming nearer, and angry shouts could be heard
in the street. Chia-chu’s wife ran in crying with her baby in
her arms, followed by a whole troop of women nurses, kitchen-
maids and chamber-maids, in a terrified, hysterical flock.

Suddenly the firing became louder than before and the stutter
of a machine-gun was added to the noise. The old man was
rushing in mortal terror into the back of the house when his
servant Ah Erh dashed in, running into him full tilt and throw-
ing him to the floor.

“Quick!” gasped Ah Erh, with not even a glance at his master.
“Hide in the back, in the kitchen-garden! And keep your heacs
down! There’s bullets flying about everywhere and soldiers all
over the place—all round the house!”

“So the Communists are on the run, are they?” asked Tseng
Tsang-hai gleefully, scrambling to his feet with a sudden spurt
of energy and clutching at Ah Erh’s sleeve.

It’s the soldiers fighting the security force ... the soldiers
are fighting among themselves!”

“Teha! Get out with your blasted drivel!” snarled Tseng
Tsang-hai, the master again, when he heard Ah Erh’s reply.
Looking round sharply, he saw a red glow reflected on the walls
round the yard—somewhere down the street a fire was blazing
away. The staccato chatter of a machine-gun was heard again.
Supposing that the worst was over, Tseng Tsang-hai ordered the

women to collect up all the valuables and some clothes, while
he himself took the opium-lamp and went over to a desk in the
corner of the room, where he opened a deed-box and took out
a large sheaf of land-deeds, IOUs and passbooks and stuffed them
into his pockets. His son suddenly sprang off the opium-couch,
where he had been crouching motionless all the while, and
joined his father in the rummage. Suddenly there was a noise
of shouting which seemed to come from just behind them. Tseng
Tsang-hai dropped the papers in terror and ran towards the
backroom: but in the dark doorway he bumped into someone
and a hand clutched at his sleeve.

“Oh, save me from them, sir!” wailed a woman’s voice.

It was Ah-chin again. Just at that moment a flaring light
lit up the room from outside and in the glare Tseng Tsang-hai
saw several men, each with a torch in his hand. When Ah-
chin recognized, one of them as her husband, she was terrified.
Her knees gave way beneath her and she sank to the floor, where
she buried her face in her hands and collapsed in a heap.
Tseng Tsang-hai took advantage of the confusion to make his
escape. He fied blindly and in a twinkling he had vanished.

“Now, you shameless hussy!” thundered Ah-chin’s husband.
“where is the old swine?” But Ah-chin just sobbed. Two of
the men had caught hold of Chia-chu and were hustling him over
to a young man who was standing there.

“The old perisher’s bolted out the back way!”

“No need to go after him, Chin-pao,” cried several voices
together. “The lads out the back’ll spot him all right.”

Just then, Chia-chu’s wife burst into the room, her hair all
over her face. Seeing her husband held by two men, she hurled
herself upon them; but someone seized her by the hair from
behind and pulled her sharply off.

“what do you think you’re on?” he roared.

“What am I on? What have you got hola of my husband
for?”

She threw herself to the floor and began screaming hysteri-
cally. Seeing Ah-chin squatting nearby, she rolled over, seized
hold of her with both hands, and bit her shoulder savagely.
In a moment the two women were fighting in a heap on the floor.

“you are the cause of all the trouble, you bitch!... You
don’t care whether they’re old or young—you'll have them
all...) . VU kill you! W’ll kill you!”

Shouts were heard and torches flashed in the back of the
house, and soon three men, one of whom was Ah Erh, dragged
Tseng Tsang-hai into the room. The old man was smothered
in dirt from head to foot, and was desperately imploring them
to spare his life. Ah-chin’s husband darted forward and crashed
his fist into his face.

“You old swine!” he rasped through clenched teeth. “Don’t
want to die, eh?”

“Kill him! Lynch him, the bloody old shark!”

A sudden roar of anger swept through the room, but the
young man wearing a pistol came across and restrained them.

“Shut up, all of you!” he rapped out sternly. “He'll be tried first!”

“Come on, then: let’s try him! He’s a money-lender, a blood-
sucker! He took my farm, the old shark! .. .”

“The old swine took my wife and had me beaten up by the
police!”

“He's always setting the police on us! He ought to be lynched!”

“Ah! and I suppose you're in the Kuomintang as well, aren’t
you?” cried the young man with a pistol, raising his voice
above the din.

Tseng Tsang-hai’s heart missed a beat at this question. For
some inexplicable reason he decided that there was hope for him
yet. He pulled himself together and looked at the young man
straight in the eye in the glare of the torchlight.

“No, not at all,” he assured him vehemently. “No one hates
the Kuomintang more than I do. I’ve had quite a number of
them arrested and shot in my time. If you don’t believe me, you
can make an investigation—Oh, yes, Ah Erh here can tell you
about it, Ah Erh, . . .”

“If you were not in the Kuomintang before, I am sure you are
now!”

The young man cut him short. With a glance at Chia-chu,
who was gazing at him with startled eyes, he continued, “And
what’s your son?”

“Ym not. one! I’m not in the Kuomintang!” Tseng Chia-chu
protested desperately. But hardly were the words out of his

mouth when Ah-chin, who had stopped fighting for the moment,
sprang up and shrieked:

“Oh yes you are! Just now you showed me that black card
and threatened me with it and made me. . . . Oh, forgive
me, Chin-pao! They forced me to do it. I couldn't stop them.”

Then the machine-gun fire started up again. The young man
glanced outside, then pulled out his pistol and shouted:

“Two of you stay here on guard. The rest of you come with
me and bring the old shark and his son with you.”

As they clattered out with their flaring torches, Tseng Chia-
chu’s wife, who had been sitting on the floor gaping blankly,
now sprang up and ran weeping after them. Just as she got
outside, she tripped over something and fell flat on her face.
Ah Erh, who had been left behind on guard with another man,
helped her to her feet.

“Have you gone off your head?” he cried roughly. Then,
as if to console her, “It’s nothing to do with you. They're
the ones who’ve done wrong and they’ll have to suffer for it,
not you. Now get in the back, and don’t go rushing about.”

*

Meanwhile, Tseng Tsang-hai and his son were being hustled
through the streets, where they saw peasants in red scarves and
armed with a varied assortment of weapons, running here and
there in twos and threes. They brushed past Li Sze, the opium-
seller, who was being walked away by a group of unarmed
peasants. Tseng Tsang-hai tried to catch his eye, but he was
hurried by so quickly that even this was not possible. They
were now heading west, in the direction of the firing. Every
two or three minutes came the angry chatter of a machine-gun.
All the shops and houses were shuttered and barred, with an
occasional ray of light escaping through the crack of a door.

Gusts of wind carried smoke and smuts and a smell of burning
—somewhere another fire was blazing away.

After turning a corner they found their way blocked by a
milling crowd. Not far ahead was the high front wall of the
Hung Chang Pawnshop. The two Tsengs and their captors were
soon swallowed up in the motley, jostling crowd of variously
armed peasants and soldiers in red scarves. Suddenly, from

the top of the pawnshop wall, there was flash and a burst of
machine-gun fire raked the street below. The Tsengs, at the
corner of the street, suddenly found themselves in the line of
fire.

“Scatter! Quick!” thundered a voice from the middle of the
crowd. Tseng Tsang-hai and Chia-chu were bundled across the
street by their captors and they all lay flat under the eaves of a
shop while rifles cracked all round them. Tseng Tsang-hai looked
like a corpse, except that his staring eyes still rolled in terror.
Chia-chu’s terrified gaze was riveted on the flashes from the
muzzle of the machine-gun ahead of him. There was a sudden
crackle of rifie-fire from behind the pawnshop and a plume of
smoke curled up against the sky. As it thickened, a red glow
appeared and tongues of flame shot upwards: the pawnshop
was on fire. The machine-gun fire died down a little, and at
the same time a deafening roar rose around them.

“Charge! Charge!”

Innumerable figures sprang up from the ground and from their
hiding-places round corners and under the eaves of the shops,
then charged forward like a whirlwind.

The men guarding the Tsengs joined in the charge, but two
of them immediately turned back and withdrew with their pris-
oners down the street. Before the four of them had gone more
than a few steps, the machine-gun on the pawnshop wall raked
the street with final burst, and they threw themselves to the
ground. Another wave of peasants and red-scarfed soldiers
came rushing up the street towards the pawnshop and swept
over them as they lay there.

The chatter of the machine-gun gradually petered out.

Tseng Chia-chu, hugging the ground, at first thought it was
all up with him. Then he tentatively moved his limbs and
found, to his surprise, that he was intact and unhurt. He sat
up and looked at his father: he was doubled up on his side,
with blood oozing from his gaping mouth. The two peasants
were also dead. Tseng Chia-chu gazed in stunned silence for a
moment, then sprang up and ran for his life.

Panic-stricken, he ran into a deserted lane. He tripped over
something and fell, but bounced up again immediately. He

instinctively looked over his shoulder in the direction of the
pawnshop and saw the flames leaping up against the sky and
shedding a red glow all round. Shouts and cries could still be
heard against the background of intermittent rifle-fire. While
his attention was distracted, he again stumbled against the ob-
ject on the ground. He automatically looked down: it was a
dead man with a red scarf around his neck and a pistol still in
his hand. An idea suddenly took shape in Chia-chu’s mind:
he unwound the red scarf from the dead man’s neck and wound
it around his own, then snatched the pistol from his hand and
ran on.

The firing had now almost ceased, and all that could be
heard were the crackle of the fire and the confused clamour of
voices in the distance. The lane was as quiet as the grave:
every door was shut fast, and there was not a glimmer of light
to be seen. Chia-chu continued on his way, peering right and
left as he went like a hungry stray dog on the prowl. As he
neared the end of the lane he suddenly stopped. In front of him
stood a two-storeyed house with a light in the window. He
hesitated a moment, then went up and knocked at the gate, a
savage gleam in his eye.

“Thank God, you’re back!” came a young woman’s voice as
the gate opened, but when she saw it was a stranger standing
there pointing a pistol at her with murder in his eyes, she let
out a scream and ran back into the house. Chia-chu ran after
her without a word. They ran across the yard and as she
reached the door of the room with a light in the window, the
woman tripped over. Disregarding her, Chia-chu burst into
the room, where he was met by the terrifted face of a wrinkled
old woman and vaguely heard her shriek.

He bounded up the stairs and into a bedroom. A lamp was
burning and the bed was hung round with a white curtain. He
ripped the curtains aside and saw a child’s rosy little face above
a green silk quilt. He quickly raised the quilt and let it fall
back, then whirled round and made for a wardrobe. He flung.
open the door and began rummaging around inside.

“Mummy! Mummy!” the child began crying. Chia-chu started
at the noise and in a panic he fired at the bed. The deafening

report sounded even louder and more appalling in the stillness
of the little room. Startled, Chia-chu let the pistol drop to the
ground. The child cried louder still, and footsteps pounded up
the stairs. The next moment the young woman burst screaming
into the room and flung herself at the bed. She picked up the
child and, hugging it to her, she leant motionless as a statue
against a table by the bed and stared dumbly at the intruder.

More out of instinct than anything, Chia-chu picked up the
pistol and aimed it at the mother and her child, his face as
black as thunder and his heart thumping wildly. As he stood
there, the old woman tottered in and fell trembling on her knees
in front of him.

“Don’t kill us, kind sir! Please don’t kill us! Take our jewel-
lery and money, but don’t—”

“Give ’em here, then! And quick about it!” Chia-chu rapped
out, feeling calmer and dropping the muzzle of the pistol towards
the floor.

The child began whimpering again, murmuring “mummy” and
burying its face against the young woman’s breast. She smiled
a little to know that her baby was still alive.

Chia-chu’s heart beat faster, for he suddenly recognized her
now that she had smiled: she was the wife of a haberdasher in
the main street, a woman he had often gazed at with lustful
eyes. He glanced from her to his pistol, then stepped forward.
He suddenly seized hold of her, flung her on to the bed, and
tried to strip her. She was so stunned by this sudden assault
that for a moment she seemed paralysed but she soon gathered
her wits about her and began resisting frantically, her blazing
eyes riveted on Chia-chu’s savage face.

“Please spare us, your honour! Have mercy on us! Please
leave her alone!” shrieked the old woman desperately, her
voice quavering with emotion. She tottered over, grasped his
legs, and tried to pull him off. The trinkets and silver coins she
had brought for him spilled out jingling on ‘to the floor.

“Keep off!’ Chia-chu roared, and viciously kicked the old
woman away. As he did so, the young woman wrenched herseif
away from him, rolled out of his reach and sprang to her feet.

li
“Now I know who you are!” she shrilled hysterically. “I know
you! you're that old shark Tseng Tsang-hai’s son! That's who
you are!”

Chia-chu’s face became suffused with rage. In a panic he
picked up the pistol from the edge of the bed and fired point-
blank at the young woman.

Two days later, the Shanghai newspapers reported the peasant
rising in Shuangchiao Town in a few lines in obscure corners.
Such occurrences had, of late, become so frequent that they had
lost their news-value, and in any case they only upset the readers,
so the papers kept such news-items down to a minimum. Besides,
the readers had got so used to news of this kind that they treated
them just as they did the frequent cases of kidnapping in the
city: they just glanced over such items and thought to themselves:
“What, again?” at the same time congratulating themselves that
the place in question did not happen to be their own home town.

The long years of increasingly violent civil war and peasant
unrest had, in a way, trained the rich in the virtue of keeping
calm — although their fear of finding themselves involved in a
sudden upheaval also grew with each passing day.

It was with mixed feeling that Wu Sun-fu read the news about
his home town in the morning paper. He had just finished
breakfast and was sprawled on the sofa with his paper, while. his
wife sat opposite him on a chair, puckering her brows slightly
and looking cross and depressed. Suddenly Wu Sun-fu threw the
newspaper aside and laughed ironically.

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s heart missed a beat. She nerved herself to
look at her husband, though her face had paled slightly. Sensi-
tive as she was, she thought he was sneering at her. He must
have found out her secret! Her pallor suddenly turned to a
flush of shame.

“What’s the matter, Pei-yao?” asked Wu Sun-fu tautly, as if
making an effort to control himself. “Humph! It had to be, I
suppose, and now it’s happened!”

She felt his dreadful; piercing eyes searching her face.

Her face paled again, and her heart began thumping with fear.
Then something seemed to snap inside her head and she sud-
denly decided to make a clean breast of everything. The thought
of her husband making a scene gave an ugly look to her face.

But Wu Sun-fu was too engrossed in his worries about Shuang-
chiao to notice her unusual mood. He swung himself off the
sofa and paced up and down, shaking his fists angrily. He stopped
and looked down at his wife’s bent head.

“So it?s happened at last,’ he muttered to himself. “Oh!
Shuangchiao Town! Three years ago, my ideal—”

“Shuangchiao Town?” she interrupted, looking up sharply. She
suddenly realized that his ironical laugh and “it’s happened”
referred to something else. She felt slightly relieved but rather
ashamed of herself. She could not suppress a blush, and the
expression in her eyes was one of mortification and guilt. She
felt sorry for her husband, and if at this moment he had shown
her a little love, she would willingly have buried her head in his
shoulder and told him everything. She would have told him
she was sorry and would have sworn to be a good and faithful
wife to him.

But Wu Sun-fu merely laid his hand lightly on her shoulder
and said dully:

“yes. A mob of rebellious peasants has broken into our home
town. For three years I’ve spared no effort to try and build it
up into a model town, and now it’s all finished! Oh, Pei-yao,
Pei-yao!”

This cri du coeur acted electrically on her and she imme-
diately warmed to him. But when she looked up at his face,
she sensed straight away that this cry was not for her but for
his Shuangchiao Town, his “ideal of a model town.” She went
cold again and felt like bursting into tears.

“Two or three months ago I began to fear that trouble of this
kind was brewing,” he continued, quite unaware of the con-
flicting emotions in his wife’s mind. “And now the inevitable’s
happened!...

He narrowed his eyes and looked past her, then suddenly ex-
ploded furiously.

“How I hate them—those idiots in charge of the town! What
the hell were they doing? They’ve got a whole battalion there

”

and two machine-guns! Are they afraid of hurting somebody,
or what? Pah!—And what the devil’s that idiot Fei Little Beard
up to? I suppose he’s dead! He hasn’t even answered my tele-
gram. A whole day’s gone by, and still not a word from him!
If I hadn’t happened to see the news in the paper, I’d never have
known! We might as well be waiting in the dark to have our
throats cut, for all we know about what’s going on!”

He stamped his foot, then threw himself fuming on to the
sofa. He picked up the paper, glanced at it with a frown, and
threw it aside. He switched his narrowed eyes to his wife. Her
silence exasperated him.

“Pei-yao,” he demanded as calmly as he could, “why don’t you
say something? What are you thinking about?”

“Well, er, I should say ... well, one’s ideals are bound to fall
to the ground sooner or later.”

“What on earth do you mean? ...” he bellowed angrily, his
eyes bulging with indignation. Then suddenly he fell silent,
picked up the paper again, and held it up in front of his face.
He was not really reading it but just fuming inwardly behind
it. He was firmly convinced that his anger was “justifiable” in
the circumstances. Normally, he was calm, firm and full of
self-confidence; for he knew how to fight his opponents. He
could be cruel, but he could also be smooth and sly. He might
sometimes storm and rage, but that did not necessarily mean
he was really angry. What made him really angry was when
he found his own men muddling and bungling, as he had the
day before yesterday with Mo Kan-cheng; and at times like that
he became so angry that his health was threatened. But now
he was more furious than ever, now that Shuangchiao Town had
fallen to the rebels, because his arm, long as it was, could not
reach those responsible for the fiasco.

His thoughts travelled from those responsible for keeping the
peace in Shuangchiao to their superiors in the county, in the
province, and even to the supreme authorities responsible for
the whole country. The more he thought about it, the more mud-
dled and upset he became. He threw down his paper and stared
down absently at the carpet with its modern designs and the
parquet floor around it, as he sat there as motionless as a statue.

The exquisitely furnished room was silent except for the rustle
of the parrot in its cage as it preened its feathers.

The butler Kao Sheng opened the door quietly and peered
round it. Sensing the tense atmosphere, he suddenly hesitated
as if he had been struck dumb and stood transfixed in the door-
way, not knowing whether to come in or not, his eyes appealing
mutely to his mistress.

“what is it?” asked Mrs. Wu Sun-fu irritably, glancing at her
husband as she spoke. Wu Sun-fu looked up sharply to see
Kao Sheng with a couple of visiting cards in his hand.

“All right,” he said gruffly, with a gesture of impatience.
“Show them into the drawing-room.”

He stood up and paced to and fro for a moment, then looked
at himself in the mirror to make sure that his expression was
back to normal. Satisfied, he went across to his wife and patted
her gently on the shoulder.

“Pei-yao,” he said, “for two days now you've looked worried
and rather depressed. Don’t fret so much about things: Yu
think of something! You’ve always been delicate.”

He took her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze, as if to trans-
fuse some of his own courage and optimism into her. Without
waiting to see what effect his words had had, he let go of her
hand and strode out of the room.

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu leaned back in her chair, her head resting
on the top of the back and her eyes brimming with tears. She
understood what her husband had said, every word of it, but she
knew, too, that she would never be able to make him understand
her own thoughts and feelings: he was too engrossed in his
“pusiness” for that. A strange sensation welled up inside her,
but whether it was one of bitterness or pleasure she could not
tell.

*

Wu Sun-fu was smiling as he stepped into the drawing-room.
The first to rise and greet him was Tang Yun-shan.

“Sun-ful” he cried, and began sympathetically: “I hear your
home town has been captured by the rebels. It just proves how
incompetent the provincial authorities are!”

“We've only just seen the news in the morning papers,” broke
in Wang Ho-fu, gripping Wu Sun-fu’s hand and sighing sympathet-

ically. “But I suppose you’ve had a detailed report from your
people in the town. Is it really as bad as the papers say, after
all? They say there were quite a lot of troops stationed there—
a whole battalion, wasn’t it? How on earth did they let it
happen?”

Wu Sun-fu smiled and asked his visitors to sit down.

“It’s only in China,” he began calmly, “that you find this
strange phenomenon: our bandits are quite extraordinary in their
violence.—I’ve only just read about it myself in the morning
papers. No other news has come through yet. I’ve no idea how
bad the situation really is, and I don’t know what to do about
it—But where’s Sun Chi-jen got to?”

“He’s been detained on business,” muttered Tang Yun-shan in
reply, lighting a cigarette. “He asked me to stand in for him.”

While he was trying to speak and draw on his cigarette at the
same time, the smoke caught in his throat and made him cough.

“We didn’t choose a very fortunate moment for our meeting,”
said Wang Ho-fu tactfully, with a smile at Wu Sun-fu, “just when
there’s been trouble in your home town. As you've only just
heard the news yourself, I’ve no doubt you’ll be busy enough
today making arrangements, so I suggest we put off our meet-
ing to another day.”

Before Wu Sun-fu could reply, Tang Yun-shan jumped in first.

“Out of the question!” he cried. “I don’t imagine for one
moment that Sun-fu will agree to that. Sun-fu’s no milksop:
he’s a man of action and initiative. I’ve yet to see him dithering
and dawdling over anything! And when it comes to a piddling
little problem like this, he just slaps on his thinking-cap and
there you are—it’s solved! Well, don’t let’s waste any more time!
Let’s get down to business!”

Wang Ho-fu and Wu Sun-fu could not help smiling at the tone
of voice in which he said this: it was the one he always used
when dealing with politicians and party officials.

“Well, so far as Tu Chu-chai’s concerned,” began Wu Sun-fu,
getting down to the matter in hand, “I’ve discussed it with him
twice already, and he'll probably come in with us, I think. But
he won’t be able to make up his mind for sure until after the
Dragon-boat Festival. He always takes his time, you know, and
that’s his strong point. I should say there is a four-to-one chance

of his coming in on it. If you remember, gentlemen, we decided
the night before last to work on the principle of keeping our
numbers down when necessary. In view of this I don’t think we
should co-opt Chu Yin-chiu, Chen Chun-yi and Chou Chung-wei.
—Though, of course, the decision on that rests with you two
gentlemen.”

“will there be enough of us without them, then?” interjected
Tang Yun-shan anxiously, then cackled inanely.

Wu Sun-fu smiled without answering, knowing well that all
Tang Yun-shan wanted was to rope in a whole group of indus-
trialists, regardless of whether they had any capital or not,
and organize them into a body which would engage in political
activities. And when it came to the tortuous mazes behind the
scenes of the business world, Tang Yun-shan was a complete
novice. Wu Sun-fu, who had been to Europe and America, was
not an old-fashioned merchant, but a modern industrialist, and
although he always kept one eye on politics, his main attention
was firmly on the profit-and-loss aspect of his business, and from
this aspect it never for one moment wavered.

Wang Ho-fu had just been sitting there with a smile on his
lips, stroking his moustache and nodding; when he saw that
Wu Sun-fu just smiled faintly in reply to Tang Yun-shan’s ques-
tion, he intervened himself.

“What do you mean, Yun-shan?” he asked. “Are you afraid
of someone else snapping them up?—yYou needn’t worry about
that!: I used to think Chou Chung-wei and Chen Chun-yi had
pots of money, seeing that they started off as compradores, and
that’s why I had ideas of including them. But now I under-
stand from Sun-fu they’ve got nothing left but their signboards.
In business, whether you're setting up a bank or anything else,
you must be realistic. You can’t afford to run a business as a
sweepstake.-Don’t you agree, Sun-fu?”

“All right, all right!” interjected Tang Yun-shan hastily. “IU
accept the decision of the majority.” Then, with a rapid glance
at his companions’ faces, he opened his briefcase and took out
a large folder.

“Now, I have here,” he went on, “Sun Chi-jen’s draft plan
for the project. Shall we look at it now?”

The “draft plan” turned out to be a brief note containing a few
lines on three points: firstly, a capital of five million dollars,
one-third of which to be collected first; secondly, a few new
enterprises—textiles, buses, mines, chemicals; and thirdly,
financial aid for several enterprises already in existence—certain
silk factories, silk goods manufactories and steamship companies.
As a matter of fact, it was no more than a summary of various
points which had been brought up on a previous occasion.

As Wu Sun-fu glanced over the “plan,” the words conjured
up in his mind visions of a forest of tall chimneys belching black
smoke, a fleet of merchantmen breasting the waves and a column
of buses speeding through the countryside. He smiled with satis-
faction. These were no castles in the air. An experienced in-
dustrialist like him did not mind a humble beginning so long
as he had a large-scale plan to work to. This optimism was
confirmed by the experience which he had accumulated in build-
ing up his home town from scratch. His first step had been to
set up a small power-house in Shuangchiao Town as the starting
point for building up his “Shuangchiao kingdom.” There, his
achievements had not been insignificant; but his scope had been
limited by the small population—barely a hundred thousand.
His activities in Shuangchiao Town had been mere child’s play
compared with this present scheme.

As he reflected along these lines, Wu Sun-fu felt that the fall
of Shuangchiao Town was not such a terrible blow after all.
His pimply face shone with excitement as he laid Sun Chi-jen’s
“draft plan” on the table. He looked at Wang Ho-fu and was
going to say something to him, when Tang Yun-shan unexpectedly
interjected:

“Since we're not going to ask Chu Yin-chiu and the rest of
them to come in with us, why should their factories be included
for financial assistance? Isn’t that being rather inconsistent?—
Of course,” he added hastily, with a self-conscious laugh, “I don’t
really understand all the ins and outs of the business—I just
wondered, that’s all.”

There was a note of suspicion in Tang Yun-shan’s voice: al-
‘though he didn’t quite understand what it was all about, he
.seemed nevertheless to have a shrewd idea that there was a catch
in it somewhere.

Wu Sun-fu and Wang Ho-fu exchanged amused glances and
burst out laughing. They turned to look at Tang Yun-shan’s
face with its mixture of cunning and naivety, then he, too, burst
out laughing. Not expecting to get an answer from either of
them, he picked up the plan and looked through it for something
else to talk about, but Wu Sun-fu snatched it from him and said:

“There’s something in what you say, Yun-shan. Anyway, since
you’re one of us now and are going to be manager of our bank
or whatever it is, we ought to let you in on what’s going to
happen. Well, now, the reason we want to keep Chu Yin-chiu
and the others out of it is because they have no capital and if
they come in they’ll be partners in name only and won't be
any earthly use to the business. On the other hand, their fac-
tories are a part, however small, of Chinese-owned industry.
They are now going downhill and it looks as if they'll soon have
to close down. I£ they do, it’ll be a loss to our national industry.
If they are eventually bought out by foreign interests in Shang-
hai, it’ll mean an increase in foreign influence in China and an
even greater loss to Chinese industry. So it’s up to us to assist
them for the good of Chinese industry. It’s in pursuance of
this aim that all the enterprises earmarked for aid in the plan
have been included.”

Wu Sun-fu stopped abruptly, bringing his forefinger down with
a crack on the table to emphasize his point, his face beaming
self-righteously. He spoke with such earnestness and lucidity
that he made Tang Yun-shan feel rather small and regret his
suspicions. Even Wang Ho-fu, his customary smile replaced by
an air of seriousness, was deeply impressed by Wu Sun-fu’s
arguments.

“You're quite right, Sun-fu,” he agreed solemnly. “I can see
you have the country’s best interests at heart. Chinese indus-
tries have been going for about fifty or sixty years now, and,
even if we don’t count the government enterprises run by such
men as Li Hung-chang in the Ching dynasty, there have still been
scores of privately run industries; but what success have they
had? It’s always been the same old story: through mismanage-
ment, most of them have gone broke and fallen into the hands
ef foreign businessmen. —I tell you, Yun-shan, it’s a crying
shame when an enterprise is left in the hands of incompetent

fools. They do neither themselves nor their country any good,
and in the end they play into the hands of the foreigners. So
we must be careful not to bungle things in the same way in our
own enterprise, and if necessary we must advise even our closest
relatives and friends to stop playing the fool, and make way for
somebody who can do the job properly.”

Tang Yun-shan burst out laughing again. Now he understood
what it was all about. He was not so stupid, after all.

The three of them then got down to discussing some of the
new enterprises included in the plan. No longer an “outsider,”
Tang Yun-shan began to feel almost like an expert. He quoted
freely from the section on “Industrial Construction” in Dr. Sun
Yat-sen’s book Plan for China’s Construction. He held that, as
soon as the civil war was over, genuine democracy would be
put into practice, and Sun Yat-sen’s projects, the “Great Eastern
Harbour” and the “Four Big Trunk Railways,” would be built
in a very short space of time. In view of this, he suggested
that they should invest now in sites close to the projected great
harbour and the railway lines for their future enterprises. As
he put this to them, he opened his briefcase and fished out a
map. He then marked certain spots on it with a pencil, giving
an enthusiastic commentary as he did so. When he had finished,
he drew a sigh of relief, as if he had just completed a monu-
mental task, and turned to his two industrialist friends.

“Well, gentlemen, what do you think of my idea?” he beamed.
“Sun Chi-jen thinks quite highly of it. Later on I'll draw up a
more detailed plan in writing so that we can publish it when
we get going and advertise for shares in the bank.”

Wang Ho-fu had nothing against it, but he hesitated to commit
himself. Instead, he turned and looked expectantly at Wu Sun-
fu, waiting for him to give his opinion first, for he considered
Wu Sun-fu wiser, more resourceful and more decisive than
himself.

But, strange to say, Wu Sun-fu, who was known for his drive
and ability to make snap decisions, now hesitated and looked
worried, for in his opinion the “Great Eastern Harbour” and the
railways were so many castles in the air. It is true he was im-
aginative, but he was also a realist. He always believed in incor-
porating a high ideal in a plan at the very outset and keeping

it in view as one’s ultimate objective, but he would not accept
a mere castle in the air. After a moment’s hesitation he said
with a reluctant smile:

“Yes, I suppose that’s not a bad idea. We need something in
the way of an attractive signboard. Actually, our plan could
consist of two parts: Yun-shan’s idea for the first part, and Sun
Chi-jen’s draft for the second; we could call the first part the
external aspect and the second the internal aspect, the first being
for public consumption as our ultimate objective and the second
constituting our immediate objective. In this way, we'll have
something solid to get on with, and then one day, when the
‘Great Eastern Harbour’ and so on have been completed, we'll
be able to expand even more. How does that sound to you,
Ho-fu?”

“A capital idea!’ Wang Ho-fu cried gleefully, completely won
over. “It can’t go wrong!”

His jubilation was interrupted by the arrival of the butler
Kao Sheng, who hurried in and whispered something in Wu
Sun-fu’s ear. The other two noticed that Wu Sun-fu winced
momentarily. He sprang up, excused himself hastily, and hurried
out of the room.

Wang Ho-fu and Tang Yun-shan remained still for a moment,
and the only movement was of the latter’s shiny bald head, and
of the smoke of his cigarette, which spiralled upwards from
his lips like bubbles rising to the surface of a pond. Suddenly,
he stubbed out his cigarette and dropped it into the ashtray.

“Capital five million dollars, one-third of which cash down,”
he muttered to himself. “That’s a little over one and a half
million. Hm, you can’t do much with that!”

He glanced at’ Wang Ho-fu, who appeared not to have heard
him, but was quietly relaxing with closed eyes, or perhaps he
was busy with some plan of his own. Tang Yun-shan looked
at the plan once more and counted the new projects listed there.
There were at least five of them, including even some heavy
industries. Now, even he, layman as he was, could not believe
that five million dollars was enough to go round, let alone a mere
million and a half. An exclamation suddenly burst from his

lips:

“Ah! there’s a great flaw in this! A very great law! We
must definitely go into it with Wu Sun-fu!”

Startled, Wang Ho-fu opened his eyes wide, but when he saw
Yun-shan’s serious expression, he burst out laughing. Tang
Yun-shan, however, who ordinarily roared with laughter on the
slightest pretext was in no laughing mood now.

“B—but, Ho-fu!l” he spluttered. “Five million won’t be
enough, will it?”

Wu Sun-fu came back into the room just in time to see Tang
Yun-shan agitatedly pointing at the draft, and to hear him say
“Five million won’t be enough, will it?’ He understood in a
flash, but for the moment he was too preoccupied with what Tu
Chu-chai had just told him on the telephone about an unfavour~
able development in the stock market to make any comment, so
he just let him rave on.

Wang Ho-fu, realizing what was the matter, began to explain
it to Tang Yun-shan in simple terms:

“It’s like this, Yun-shan: we intend to do things step by step,
not start all the enterprises at once—”

“Then why should we be applying for a government licence for
everything in the plan?” protested Tang Yun-shan with a glance
at Wu Sun-fu.

“Yes, but taking out a licence first,” explained Wang Ho-fu
testily, becoming impatient of Tang Yun-shan’s naivety, “is just
like making advance bookings at a theatre.”

“To tell the truth,” joined in Wu Sun-fu, dropping into a chair,
“the first thing we’ll do once the business gets going won’t be to
set up new enterprises, but to help out those of the old ones which
are a bit shaky. But, all the same, we have to make advance
bookings, so to speak, for new enterprises.”

“That’s all very well,” retorted Tang Yun-shan, “but what
happens if they don’t want us to help them out? Your million
and a half capital will be standing idle!”

“Ah, but we'll have a way of making them want to!” Wu
Sun-fu assured him with a sardonic smile.

“Yun-shan, money need never stand still. And how far do you
think a mere million and a half would go if you put it into gov-
ernment bonds?”

“Ho-fu’s right,” corroborated Wu Sun-fu. “Since our com-
pany is to be essentially a financial scheme, it'll be one of the
main lines of our business to speculate in government bonds.”

All this only made Tang Yun-shan all the more confused. He
scratched his bald head and stared at the other two as if he
were apologizing for being such a “greenhorn,” though deep down
he had more than a suspicion that they were deliberately avoid-
ing the point at issue.

The door opened, and the butler Kao Sheng could be seen out-
side standing politely aside to allow a visitor to pass into the
room. It was Sun Chi-jen, beaming all over his face. It was
obvious at a glance that he was the bearer of good news. Tang
Yun-shan’ was the first to notice him.

“Ah, Chi-jen!” he cried, jumping up. “You're just in time!
I was just getting out of my depth. I herewith relinquish my
office as your locum tenens!”

Sun Chi-jen gave a start, thinking that something must have
gone wrong, but he was reassured when Wu Sun-fu and Wang
Ho-fu burst out laughing and hurried forward to greet him. They
assured him that they had discussed his plan and passed it
unanimously, and that they would get going as soon as a date
had been fixed.

“Chi-jen, I understood you were otherwise engaged,” Wu Sun-
fu said. “I’m glad you managed to get here after all.”

“? had an appointment with a friend of mine,” replied Sun
Chi-jen, sinking into a rocking-chair. “Nothing important, really,
but in the course of our discussion I stumbled on just the sort
of thing we want—” His long neck swung round towards Wu
Sun-fu.

“Guess what it is, Sun-fu!” he beamed. “Well, in three days
we can set up our company!”

This was news indeed! Everyone looked overjoyed but no
one spoke: they just turned and looked expectantly at Sun Chi-jen.

“Now you know it takes a long time to get a licence from the
Ministry of Finance for a banking company, but we can’t really
afford to wait. If we called ourselves a consortium, we could
take out a licence more easily, but our activities would be rather
limited, and we don’t want that. But now I have a solution:
There’s a certain trust company which is willing to co-operate

with us—I say ‘co-operate,’ but actually, of course, we’ll control
the concern. The reason I dashed over was to break the news,
so that we could discuss it and decide what to do. If you all
think it would be a good idea, we can work out the terms we
shall offer them.”

Sun Chi-jen spoke slowly and deliberately, but his little head
wagged with excitement.

An animated discussion ensued: questions, replies, pondering,
and planning. The atmosphere was suddenly charged with ex-
citement and tension. They expected Wu Sun-fu to subscribe
two hundred thousand dollars within a week, but he felt rather
hard put to it to do it, for just lately he had borrowed close on
a million dollars—from various banks and money-lenders to pay
his share in Chao Po-tao’s “bull company” and on top of that he
still had no idea how much he had lost in the incident in his
home town. Consequently, his financial “manoeuvring power”
had been much reduced. Nevertheless, he made up his mind on
it and agreed to Sun Chi-jen’s proposal, which was that within
a week of the trust company accepting their terms, the three of
them should each pay in two hundred thousand dollars as his
share of the initial capital, so that they could begin operations
without more ado.

They also decided that their first move would be to make a
loan to help out the two industrialists Chu Yin-chiu and Chen
Chun-yi.

“You'll arrange things with the trust company, then, Chi-jen,”
said Wu Sun-fu with enthusiasm. “I think we’d best leave that
side of it entirely to you.” He was quite confident of success,
like a general on the eve of a decisive battle.

“Shan’t we try to get any more subscriptions of shares, then?”
Tang Yun-shan asked hopefully.

“No!—” chorused the others firmly.

Tang Yun-shan forced a smile, though he was inwardly rather
disappointed. It was now quite clear that he would never have
the opportunity of seeing his masterpiece, his great industrial
scheme, in the papers. But he quickly swallowed his disappoint-
ment and soon he was talking and laughing again.

*

After seeing his visitors off at the gate, Wu Sun-fu returned to
the drawing-room and paced confidently up and down for a while.
By now it was ten o’clock and time for him to go to the factory.
He went into his study and wrote out two telegrams, one to the
county government and one to Fei Little Beard, care of the
county government. Then he rang for Kao Sheng and gave him
his orders:

“Mr. Tu Chu-chai’ll be ringing up later on. Ask him to get
in touch with me at the factory. Two telegrams for Li Kuei to
send off at once. And now the car!”

“Very good, sir. Are you going to the factory now, sir? There’s
a Mr. Tu from the factory to see you—he’s been waiting some
time at the lodge. Will you see him now, sir?”

Wu Sun-fu had forgotten that he had sent for Tu Wei-yueh,
and this was the second time he had come. The first time he
had waited a whole evening without seeing a sign of Wu Sun-
fu, and now he’d come just when he was busy. After a mo-
ment’s hesitation, Wu Sun-fu said rather impatiently, “Oh, all
right; show him in.”

Wu Sun-fu sat down at his desk. He glanced over the staff
list, trying to remember what Tu Wei-yueh looked like, but with-
out much success. There were so many petty clerks in the fac-
tory that even he, shrewd as he was, could not be expected to
remember them all individually. His thoughts wandered to the
“pep-talk” he had given the women the day before, and the
various reports submitted by Mo Kan-cheng. Yes, everything
seemed to be going smoothly. All he had to do was to use a
little more tact, and the storm would probably blow over.

He felt so relieved at the thought that when Tu Wei-yueh came
into the room, his purplish face, usually so stern, was brightened
by a ghost of a smile,

“So you’re Tu Wei-yueh, are you?” said Wu Sun-fu, leaning
forward slightly and darting his keen eyes over the young man.
Tu Wei-yueh bowed but made no reply. He showed no signs of
nervousness, but returned Wu Sun-fu’s glance frankly. As he
stood there, erect and dignified, his clear, healthy face was com-
pletely expressionless and his bright eyes were alert and com-
posed.

“How long have you been at the factory?”

“Two years and ten days,” Tu Wei-yueh answered briefly and
quietly. His exactness pleased Wu Sun-fu.

“Where do you come from?”

“I’ve the honour to be a fellow-townsman of yours.”

“Oh ... from Shuangchiao Town, eh? Who vouches for your
good conduct?”

“Nobody.”

Wu Sun-fu was amazed. He reached out for the staff list for
more information about this young man, when the latter himself
explained:

“As you may remember, I came with a letter of recommenda-
tion from Old Mr. Wu, your father. You put me in the General
Office as a junior clerk. Since then I’ve never been told that I
need someone to vouch for me.”

Wu Sun-fu’s face twitched in what could have been a smile. He
remembered now: two years ago, his late father had recom-
mended this young man as the son of an old friend of his, who
also happened to be a pupil of Wu Sun-fu’s grandfather. Wu Sun-
fu, who had never liked his father’s way of life and his old-
fashioned outlook, now suddenly looked at Tu Wei-yueh with
transferred disfavour. He scowled and came straight to the point.

“It’s been reported to me that it was you who let on about the
wage-cut and so caused the sit-down strike the other day.”

“That’s right: I told some of the women that a wage-cut was
coming soon.”

“You did, did you? Quite the little talebearer, aren’t you?—
You know damn well it’s against the regulations!”

“I don’t remember seeing anything of the kind in your Factory
Regulations, Mr. Wu,” Tu Wei-yueh replied calmly, gazing com-
posedly at Wu Sun-fu’s angry face.

Wu Sun-fu narrowed his eyes and looked at Tu Wei-yueh, who
just stood there with a quiet dignity, his features betraying not
the slightest sign of uneasiness. He was the first employee who
had not quailed before Wu Sun-fu’s basilisk eye. Wu Sun-fu
could not help secretly admiring this cool and courageous young
fellow. His face relaxed a little as he said in a milder tone of
voice:

“In any case, you shouldn’t have told them. Can’t you see
what a lot of trouble it’s caused?”

“I’m afraid I can’t agree with you there. Since there’s going
to be a wage-cut, what difference does it make whether the
women know about it now or later on? Besides, even if you
hadn’t decided to cut their wages, they’d have gone on strike
just the same. It was bound to happen sooner or later.”

“what the devil do you mean by that?”

“Just this: the women already know that you’ve got a con-
tract for a large quantity of silk and that you're speeding up
the work to meet the order on time. Naturally enough, this is
an opportunity for them and they don’t want to miss it.”

At this, Wu Sun-fu’s face became convulsed with rage.

“What!” he rasped through clenched teeth. “They know
about my contract? They know even this? I suppose you told
them that, too, did you?”

“In a way, yes. They’d heard about it from some other source,
and ‘when they came and asked me, I just confirmed it. I couldn’t
have told them a lie. I’m sure you'll agree, Mr. Wu, that a man
who tells lies is the last man to rely upon.”

With a bellow of rage, Wu Sun-fu banged on the table and
sprang to his feet.

“You scoundrel!” he roared. “You're just toadying to the
women!”

To this Tu Wei-yueh did not reply, except to bow slightly and
smile his calm smile.

“I know you carry on with some girl named Chu. You're
just trying to get round her!”

“Mr. Wu, please don’t drag my private affairs into it said
Tu Wei-yueh calmly and defiantly, a glint of resentment in his
keen eyes as he stared Wu Sun-fu in the eye.

Wu Sun-fu’s expression had also changed: he now looked firm
and cold-blooded, and much more formidable than when he was
ranting and raving. Tu Wei-yueh could see from all this what
was coming to him, yet he was not in the least perturbed. He
was intelligent, resourceful and courageous, but he was also
stubborn. He was not without a certain affection for his job
too, but he would never stoop to fawning on his employer in
the way Mo Kan-cheng did. He stood there with a faint smile,
calmly awaiting Wu Sun-fu’s final disposal of him.

yr

An oppressive silence fell upon the room. Wu Sun-fu stretched
out his hand to press the bell on the wall. At a touch of
his finger, Tu Wei-yueh’s fate would be sealed. However, he
suddenly changed his mind, took his hand away, and turned to
scan Tu Wei-yueh’s face once more. Alertness, calmness, cour-
age: he could see them all in the youngster’s face. A young
man like this, if properly handled, could be very useful, he
mused, There was no one to touch him on the whole of his
staff. But was he reliable? These days, the more ability, drive
and initiative a young man had, the more likely he was to have
wild ideas. But that was something he could not tell at first
sight. Wu Sun-fu thought hard and long, and when he finally
sat down his expression was not so fearsome as it had been a few
moments ago, though his voice was still harsh when he spoke
again:

“The way you behave is nothing short of egging the women on
to make trouble.”

“You ought to realize, Mr. Wu, that that is something nobody
could do!”

“You're just an agitator!” Wu Sun-fu raved angrily.

No answer. Tu Wei-yueh merely drew himself up and smiled
sardonically.

“What are you sneering at?”

“Am I sneering? If I sneer, Mr. Wu, it’s because I should
have thought you would at least have realized that everyone
must live and that everyone wants a decent standard of living.
That fact alone is the most powerful incentive to agitation.”

“Tst! Nonsense! The women have more sense than you.
They realize that there are other points of view to be considered
besides their own. They realize that capital and labour must
work together. Didn’t you see the way they quietened down when
I explained things to them yesterday? And don’t the trade
union people support me, and aren’t they doing their best to
find a solution? Oh, yes, I know there are some dangerous
elements among the women, inciting them to make trouble.
They pretend to have the women’s interests at heart, but all the
time they’re trying to take the bread out of their mouths by
losing them their jobs. I’m in possession of detailed information
about them and I know these dangerous elements are just the

dupes of someone outside who's just leading them up the garden
path. I’m for peace, myself, and I don’t like the idea of enforc-
ing high-handed measures; but as the owner of the factory I’m
like the head of a family, and as such I can’t allow any black
sheep among my employees. I’ll have to expose the evil inten-
tions of the trouble-makers, so that the women may know them
for what they are, and fight them themselves from within!—”

“Mr, Wu, was it just to tell me all this that you summoned me
here twice?” Tu Wei-yueh asked disdainfully, his face still not
betraying a flicker of emotion, as soon as Wu Sun-fu paused for
breath.

“Fh? What else were you expecting?”

“Nothing. But I should have thought that you might have had
something else to say.”

Wu Sun-fu stared at the young man in astonishment and was
beginning to wonder whether he had not a madman to deal with.

“Get out!” he suddenly stormed. “And leave your badge here!”

Slowly and calmly, Tu Wei-yueh took out his employee’s badge
and laid it on the table. He smiled, bowed slightly, and turned
to go, when Wu Sun-fu suddenly called him back.

“Just a minute! If you'll just come down to the factory with
me, you'll be able to see for yourself how quiet everything is
now and how game the women are to consider the interests of
the factory as a whole!”

Tu Wei-yueh turned and looked Wu Sun-fu in the eye. The
smile had never left.his face, and Wu Sun-fu could see now that
it was not the smile of a madman at all.

“What are you smiling at?”

“I'm smiling... at the thought that it’s usually calm before
a storm—so calm that there isn’t even a breath of wind!”

Wu Sun-fu’s face suddenly purpled, but he immediately pulled
himself together. His experienced eye had at last discovered
something unique in Tu Wei-yueh’s attitude, something which
told him that this young fellow was decidedly not mad, but
something quite out of the ordinary. Wu Sun-fu asked as polite-
ly as he could:

“Do you mean to say the information I’ve had from Mo Kan-
cheng is incorrect? Do you mean to say that the trade union
people will side with the women to fight against me?”

“I’ve no idea what Mo Kan-cheng’s told you. No, I don’t think
the trade union people would turn against you. But surely you
must know how little use they really are to you?”

“Eh? Do you mean—?”

“These union people may be rather important in your eyes,
but the women don’t care a damn for them.”

“You mean they’re useless?”

“It’s not quite as simple as that. If the women had confidence
in them, they’d naturally be very useful; but as they seem to
be on your side, the women don’t trust them. This so-called
trade union’s nothing more than a figure-head—no, I don’t think
you could even call it that any longer, for even a mere figure-
head, as you’re probably well aware, has its uses as a stimulant,
and our trade union hasn’t even that much usefulness. Now
that the unrest among the women is getting really serious, the
union has been shown up for the empty bubble that it is. They
want to do as you tell them and at the same time keep up the
pretence of representing the interests of the women. I suppose
I’d better be frank with you: the union leaders want to come to
a secret understanding with you, while at the same time they
still put on an act with the women of protecting their interests.”

“What do you mean, ‘understanding’?”

“They want a five per cent rise in the monthly bonus and a
special two-dollar bonus for the Dragon-boat Festival.”

“What! A bigger bonus and one at the festival as well?”

“Yes, that’s the idea they’re putting into the women’s heads.
They hope such a concession will stave off the women’s demand
for a cost-of-living allowance. If they can’t even do this for
them, their bubble will be pricked. Since they run the union,
it’s inevitable that they should try to play this sort of trick.”

Wu Sun-fu’s face became distorted with rage.

“So that’s their game, is it?” he snarled. “How is it that Mo
Kan-cheng hasn’t told me anything about it? Has he fallen
asleep on the job?”

Tu Wei-yueh smiled cynically.

After a moment Wu Sun-fu calmed down and eyed Tu Wei-
yueh narrowly.

“Why didn’t you come and tell me all this earlier?” he
demanded abruptly.

“You didn't ask me earlier, Mr. Wu,” replied Tu Wei-yueh
dryly, a self-satisfied glint in his eye. “Anyway, I shouldn't
have thought a mere clerk doing odd jobs in the office and earn-
ing twenty dollars a month would be expected to send in reports
of this kind. But things are different now that you’ve taken
back my employee’s badge: now I am just the son of your
father’s friend. We're just two friends chatting about this and
that—the union, conditions in the factory, and so on. I don’t
mind discussing these things now that there’s no danger of
arousing jealcusy or being accused of crawling or stabbing
anyone in the back.”

Feeling the sting in Tu Wei-yueh’s remarks, Wu Sun-fu forced
a smile; he couldn’t help admiring this formidable young man.
He couldn’t understand how it was that he had failed to notice
him before when he had been at the factory for two years.

“You appear to be a young man of strong will,” he said tenta-
tively.

“Yes, Mr. Wu,” smiled Tu Wei-yueh. “Except for my will-
power, there’s nothing else I’ve got that I can take a pride in.”

The insinuation in his reply seemed quite lost on Wu Sun-
fu, who bent his head in thought for a moment, then suddenly
burst out:

“So they want an increased bonus and a special bonus into
the bargain, do they? I just can’t agree to that. Can you see
any way of putting an end to the trouble without giving in to
them?”

“You can refuse if you like, but if you do the trouble will end
in quite another way.”

“you think the women would dare to riot?”

“That depends on how you go about it, Mr. Wu.”

“The way you look at it, I must give them something, then
—isn’t that so? All right, then: I may as well help the union
people to play their trick.”

“you can do it that way if you like.”

Wu Sun-fu was none too pleased at this reply. He glanced
quickly at the smiling face of Tu Wei-yueh.

“What else can you suggest?”

“Just work it out, Mr. Wu: how much would it cost you,
if you did what the union people want you to do?”

“About five thousand dollars, I suppose.”

“Right,” continued Tu Wei-yueh calmly. “Five thousand dol-
lars is not what you'd call a large sum of money. But perhaps
a smaller sum than five thousand could produce even greater
results, if only you can find someone who knows how to make
good use of it.”

Wu Sun-fu’s thick eyebrows seemed to twitch, but his face be-
trayed not a flicker of emotion. His keen eyes gradually fas-
tened themselves upon Tu Wei-yueh’s face in a penetrating gaze
that seemed to go right through him, so that even Tu Wei-yueh,
for all his coolness, felt rather ill at ease. He dropped his head
and bit his lip.

Wu Sun-fu suddenly stood up and boomed, “Do you know what
the women are up to now?”

“No, I don’t. I expect you'll find out when you get to the
factory,” countered Tu Wei-yueh, looking the other in the face
and drawing himself up to his full height. Wu Sun-fu could not
help laughing good-humouredly. He realized that once this
young man had made up his mind not to give anything away,
there was nothing he could do to make him. His obstinacy
annoyed him rather, but he admired his firmness, and had now
made up his mind to enlist the young man as an ally. He picked
up a pen and, without sitting down, scribbled a few lines on a
sheet of note paper and gave it to Tu Wei-yueh.

“I took your badge away just now,” he said with a gracious
smile, “and now I’m giving you this in exchange.”

The note said briefly: “To Mr. Mo Kan-cheng. This is to
inform you that as from this month Mr. Tu Wei-yueh’s salary
will be increased by fifty dollars. Wu Sun-fu, May 19.”

Tu Wei-yueh glanced over the note and laid it on the table.
He said nothing, and his face was as expressionless as before.

“What!” gasped Wu Sun-fu, staring at Tu Wei-yueh in amaze-
ment. “Don’t you want to work for me?”

“Thank you very much for your kindness, Mr. Wu, but I
couldn’t accept it. This piece of paper won’t enable me to do
anything worth while.”

For the first time Tu Wei-yueh betrayed some emotion in his
voice, as he frankly returned Wu Sun-fu’s gaze.

Wu Sun-fu did not say anything, but quietly pressed the bell
on the wall; then, picking up his pen again, he added a few
words to the note: “All inspectors and forewomen below Mo
Kan-cheng will take orders from Tu Wei-yueh as from today.
Disobedience will not be tolerated.” He threw down the pen and
turned to the butler who had just come into the room. “Send
the car round to take Mr. Tu here to the factory.”

Tu Wei-yueh read the postscript, looked at Wu Sun-fu intently
for a moment, then bowed: “As from today, I have the privilege
of serving you, Mr. Wu.”

“If a man’s got ability, I'll always give him a fair chance. I’m
well aware that there are a lot of very able young men about
these days, but unfortunately I’m always too busy to be able to
spend much time getting around among the younger people.—
And now you can go back to the factory and tell the women
that I'l do my best to give them satisfaction. — And if you want
to see me about anything, just drop in any time.”

Wu Sun-fu’s face beamed with satisfaction, for his keen powers
of observation and appraisal told him that the trouble in the
factory would soon be over.

*

_ However, a man like Wu Sun-fu could not be content with
a single achievement. He began pacing the floor, sunk in
thought. Suddenly a doubt began to trouble him: was he such a
good judge of men after all? Though he had always kept his
eyes open for capable men, he had overlooked this Tu Wei-yueh
until this moment. Another thing: he had not been able to
anticipate this trouble in the factory, and right up till yesterday
he still had no accurate idea of how strong the women really
were. As a matter of fact, he had been blinded and deceived
by his own underlings, and even found himself under the menace
of his unruly workers. Now, even though he had high hopes
of finding a solution to the immediate problem—and a solution
which was to his advantage—nevertheless it had cost him a
pretty penny. Taking things all in all, it had been a serious
setback for him.

It was not that he grudged spending an extra two or three
thousand dollars—he sometimes lost more than that in a few
games of mahjong, and gladly—but to have to pay out because

of his subordinates’ inefficiency was a different matter and he
would have to put a stop to it. Foreign businessmen, he mused,
were naturally more far-sighted and they knew how to manage
things with a rod of iron, but then they had loyal and competent
staff. It was this last that lay behind their ability to deal with
difficult situations easily and make a success of everything they
did. In industrially backward China, on the other hand, there
was no such force of trained staff available. The office staff
he had in his factory were no better than a lot of hangers-on
sponging on a local squire: all they were fit for was dodging
their work, fawning on him, and making a mess of everything.
As these thoughts passed through his mind, Wu Sun-fu suddenly
lost hope in the future of China’s youthful industry. There was
not even a reserve of staff to fill the lower administrative grades,
to say nothing of the higher grades.

People like Mo Kan-cheng, for instance, were not fit to be
anything more than rent and debt collectors in a country town.
The forewoman Wang Chin-chen and the overseer Li the Pock-
marked were a couple of scoundrels whose only abilities were
bluffing, bickering, beating the women, and taking his bribes.
For all that, he had not got rid of them because it was so diffi-
cult to find competent, reliable staff. Besides, with his own
eagle eye watching over things all the time, there should never
have been any trouble. How was he to know that he was on
the verge of disaster? It must be that the women are not so
tractable as used to be!

The more Wu Sun-fu pondered as he paced to and fro, the
more depressed he became. He had always believed in hiding
his fits of depression from other people, even from his wife. It
was this custom that had enabled him to win the trust and re-
spect of other people, and he also regarded it as the best method
of self-discipline. But there was one disadvantage: whenever
he locked himself up and fretted and brooded alone, he was al-
ways acutely aware of his loneliness. He felt like a commander-
in-chief racking his brains without a trusted aide-de-camp to
confide in or an able staff-officer to advise him. Just a short
while ago he had taken a liking to Tu Wei-yueh and promoted
him on the spot to a position of great responsibility; but he was
suddenly assailed by doubts—not about the young man’s talents,

about which he had no qualms, but about his ideas. Nowadays,
he believed, the more intelligent, capable and spirited a young
man was, the more dangerous were his ideas, and the more
likely he was to be possessed by the “evil creed” of communism.

This worry nagged at Wu Sun-fu until he was on the verge of
despair. Middle-aged men like Mo Kan-cheng were useless and
young men like Tu Wei-yueh were dangerous. Yet how could
he keep the wheels of industry turning on his own? He scowled
with frustration and clenched his teeth, then picked up the tele-
phone and barked into it: he had decided to tell Mo Kan-cheng
to keep an unobtrusive eye on Tu Wei-yueh.

But when he heard Mo Kan-cheng humming and hawing like
an imbecile at the other end of the line, Wu Sun-fu suddenly
changed his mind and rasped sternly at him instead:

“Have you received my note?... Right! All the staff will
obey Mr. Tu’s orders—and no shirking!... Money? Well,
he’ll want some for—um, ‘expenses’. . . . Let him have what

he wants, and he can account to me personally. Understand?”

Wu Sun-fu put down the receiver and smiled grimly. Now
that he had taken the plunge and put Tu Wei-yueh on trial, he
would have to keep an eye on this likable yet alarming young
man himself. And he had to show himself consistent and firm
of purpose and not let his employees know that he could some-
times waver—that he had put a man in a job and yet hesitated
to trust him.

He left the library in a hurry and walked along the veranda
to the drawing-room.

His bulletproof motorcar was waiting for him in front of the
steps outside the drawing-room, and his chauffeur and Old Kuan,
his bodyguard, were chatting idly.

The door of the small drawing-room was ajar and Wu Sun-fu
heard sounds of gay youthful laughter coming from inside. He
frowned and automatically glanced to see his wife, Lin Pei-shan,
and Fan Po-wen with their heads together. He had seldom
paid attention to them, but this time he felt suddenly annoyed.
Coughing tactfully, he stepped into the room with an expression
of displeasure on his face.

Surprised, the three of them started apart to reveal a fourth,
Ah-hsuan, who had been hidden between Mrs. Wu Sun-fu and

Fan Po-wen. The boy was still engrossed in some book or other
quite unaware of Wu Sun-fu’s presence. The latter walked up
to them, glaring round the room and finally stopping to fix his
gaze on Ah-hsuan.

Ah-hsuan suddenly came to and looked quickly up and, seeing
who it was, self-consciously put the book down. Lin Pei-shan
had gone over and sat down by the window and was tittering
behind her hand. Wu Sun-fu had only intended to assert his
authority, but he was becoming really annoyed. He restrained
himself, however, and casually picked up the book and glanced
at it: it was a collection of Fan Po-wen’s verses.

“Modern poetry, eh? You youngsters are very fond of that
sort of thing, aren’t you!”

His tone and smile conveyed a hint of sarcasm. He glanced
at Fan Po-wen, and began idly turning the pages. When a poem
caught his eye:

Gone are the lovely banks of the Su

Whose winding way was edged with tender green,
Usurped by motorcars like beetles black
Enveloped in a swirl of yellow dust;

And the vulgar villas of the idle rich

Have sullied the quiet grace of West Lake.

Wu Sun-fu broke into a contemptuous laugh. He suddenly re-
membered that Fan Po-wen had often accused the “vulgar bour-
geoisie”’ of not understanding that sublime and sacred subject—
Art. This view of Fan Po-wen, which he had thought merely
ridiculous before, was now offensive to him. Modern youth were
just like that: either romantic and decadent, or radical and per-
verted. As he looked at the poet Fan Po-wen standing before
him, his mind flashed to Tu Wei-yueh who had just left him.
Since he could not very well give the poet a lecture he turned
to take it out on his younger brother.

“Well, well, Ah-hsuan! You’ve only been in Shanghai a few
days, and you’ve already become a man of culture! Unfortunate-
ly, only a talented man can be a poet, and one could hardly
eall you talented!”

“But there’s a famous saying that a poet can be either a genius
or an idiot,” put in Fan Po-wen sarcastically, with a knowing

wink at Lin Pei-shan. “In Ah-hsuan one can catch a glimpse of
the poet. Anyway, he’s much more hopeful than Mammon sit-
ting in his golden palace.” This witticism made Lin Pei-shan
giggle uncontrollably and even Mrs. Wu Sun-fu couldn’t help
smiling. Wu Sun-fu and Ah-hsuan, however, remained serious;
then Ah-hsuan looked up quickly in bewilderment to see that
Wu Sun-fu was frowning. Though not a “poet” himself, Wu
Sun-fu understood quite well what Fan Po-wen meant. He
detested people who showed off their cleverness in glib phrases,
and believed that only a nincompoop could indulge in such petty
tricks of speech just to get a laugh from the ladies. He glared
briefly at Fan Po-wen and turned to go, when the latter said:

“I say, Sun-fu, I really don’t understand why you have to stay
in the silk business. There are lots of other ways of making
money, you know.”

“Silk’s the only Chinese industry that can win back some of
the money that’s going out of the country,” replied Wu Sun-fu,
as if he grudged an answer; his dislike of the poet was more in-
tense than ever.

“Oh, is it? Chinese silk goes abroad, is made into silk goods,
and then sold back to China. Look at Pei-yao and Pei-shan—
they’re wearing Chinese silk from abroad! Last month I hap-
pened to be in Hangchow and I noticed that on nine looms out
of ten they were using Japanese rayon. This year alone Shang-
hai merchants have imported over eighteen thousand bales of
Japanese rayon at a cost of some nine million eight hundred
thousand dollars! At present the export of Chinese silk to
Europe is at a standstill, and the New York market is flooded
with Japanese silk, while Chinese silk is just piling up in the
manufacturers’ warehouses. And while you are bemoaning the
fact that there is no market for your silk, Chinese silk goods
manufacturers are importing Japanese rayon. Isn’t that a curious
phenomenon and a handicap to Chinese industry?”

Fan Po-wen delivered himself of this oration as if he was
anxious to free himself of the stigma of “romantic poet,” but
for all that, Wu Sun-fu’s dislike of the poet was in no way les-
sened; in fact, it made him dislike him all the more. As an
industrialist, he was not interested in such superficial views
on the bad luck of Chinese silk. The chief mission of an in-

dustrialist, as he saw it, was to develop industry, to increase
the number of factory chimneys, and to expand the market.
If his silk went through a factory in a foreign country and came
back to China in modified form, that was not his concern, It
was the job of the government to take care of that. An in-
dustrialist could not cut off his nose to spite his face!

“Ha! the same old platitudes!” snorted Wu Sun-fu cynically,
as he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. In the doorway he
turned his head to call his wife into the dining-room, where he
warned her sternly:

“Pei-yao, I think you should keep an eye on your sister, and
not let her fritter away her time as if she were still a child.”

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu stared at her husband, not knowing what
to make of it.

“Po-wen,” he went on, “may be intelligent and witty, but
he’s got no ‘go’ in him. I don’t like to see Pei-shan going round
with him all the time. Fu-fang’s told me that she would like
to make a match between her and Tu Hsueh-shih. So far as
I can see, Hsueh-shih’s the more promising of the two.”

“Oh... I see,” his wife answered hesitatingly after a long
pause, still staring at him. “Don’t you think we’d better leave
her to make her own choice?”

She did not like Fan Po-wen particularly—-she lately changed
her mind about him—nor did she think highly of Tu Hsueh-shih.
She had a plan of her own for her sister.

Wu Sun-fu frowned irritatedly, but said no more. With a
glance at his wife, who stood there deep in thought, he slipped
out into the garden, got into his car, and snapped at his
chauffeur:

“The club!”
VI

FAN Po-wen and Lin Pei-shan were sitting together on a red
bench in a shady, secluded corner of Jessfield Park. They had
been there for half an hour.

Fan Po-wen had Lin Pei-shan’s handbag in his hands and
was toying with it, with that debonair and carefree expression
on his face which a poet must have. His head on one side, he
was listening with rapt attention while she murmured softly
and desultorily, her voice rising and falling. Though they were
sheltered by a clump of cypresses from the gaze of passers-by
and from the slanting rays of the setting sun, Fan Po-wen felt
tiny beads of perspiration breaking out on his temples—but
whether it was because there was no breeze or for some other
reason it was hard to tell.

Lin Pei-shan was wearing a thin, light-blue frock, low-cut and
sleeveless. She was sixteen and just at the age when her devel-
oping figure had reached a plump perfection. Her rounded
breasts seemed to be bursting out of the close confines of her
lace-edged white silk slip. As she talked she traced lines on
the grass with the point of her shoe. She was lively yet dis-
passionate, as if she was not telling him about herself at all,
but about someone else who did not concern her.

Her voice gradually tailed off and soon she stopped altogether;
then, with a sparkling smile, she tilted back her head to gaze
at the reddening clouds overhead.

“Go on, Pei-shan!” urged Fan Po-wen, turning suddenly to-
wards her after sharing her contemplation of the sky for a while.
“you’re keeping me in suspense, you know.” Once more he
wiped his perspiring brow, then fixed his eyes a little nervously
on her pretty face.

Lin Pei-shan returned his look, but without the least sign of
nervousness or excitement—just a languid smile. Then, sud-
denly, she giggled and made a gesture as much as to say “That’s
all.”

“There’s nothing more to tell,” she said in her clear, tinkling
voice. “I’ve told you everything. Aren’t you satisfied?”

“I’ve heard enough, but not understood enough,” Fan Po-wen
flashed back. Lin Pei-shan giggled and stretched herself, letting
one arm flash past Fan Po-wen’s face as she did so. The breath
of fragrance from her arm so unnerved him that he completely
forgot what he had been going to say. He could only gaze, in-
fatuated, at her round bright eyes beneath slender eyebrows, her
gleaming white teeth between scarlet, slightly parted lips, her
smooth white neck and her swelling breast; and as he gazed, all
sorts of vague, confused thoughts chased each other through his
brain. When his eyes went up again to her face, he found her
as calm, dispassionate and impersonal as she always was. Her
smile was tender, but apparently without any special significance.
Fan Po-wen felt something nagging at his mind and suddenly
remembered what it was he was going to say:

“T really can’t understand why Sun-fu doesn’t agree that you
and I—”

“That’s Sun-fu’s affair,” she broke in before he could finish.
“There’s no point in going over it again!” Neither her face nor
her voice betrayed any unusual excitement or annoyance.

Fan Po-wen was taken aback at her reply: her indifference
puzzled him. He waited a moment, then, as she seemed to
consider the subject closed, he tried another approach:

“And there’s something else which I don’t understand—why is
it that your sister disagrees, too?”

“I’ve no idea. I just told you what she told me. What’s the
point of bothering our heads about it?”

She sounded so detached and impersonal that he began to feel
exasperated. With an effort, he resisted the temptation to scin-
tillate, and said simply:

“Don’t be so silly, Pei-shan! Surely you don’t just go around
repeating like a parrot what your sister says? Why don’t you
try to think for yourself? You speak as if your own feelings
weren't involved: it is as if you had become completely detached

from yourself and were looking at yourself from a distance. —
Pei-shan, you ought to be yourself. Haven’t you any ideas of
your own? Do try to find yourself!”

“But I’m here, sitting beside you. It’s me that’s been talking
with you all this time!—-If there is another me, I’ve never
known it, and I don’t want to know, either. My sister told me
certain things in confidence and asked me to keep them to my-
self, but since you kept asking me and since some of the things
she said concern you, I just repeated what she said to me. But
now you want to know what my own ideas about it are—well,
as a matter of fact, I never have any definite ideas about any-
thing. I always feel there’s good and bad to everything, and
I’ye never really worried what anyone thinks of anything. —
Well, are you still not satisfied?—Oh, it’s really difficult to know
what else to say!”

Her voice was soft and tender and she smiled, as she spoke
which made Fan Po-wen feel a little better, in a way. But he
was conscious that she had said a great deal without touching
the crucial point—her real attitude towards him.

He drew a sigh and rested his chin dejectedly on his upturned
palm, while his eyes strayed from the grass beneath his feet
to her shapely calves. On a sudden impulse, he snapped open
her handbag and looked in the little oval mirror inside the flap.
He saw a face which was neither too round nor too pointed, a
fine-looking intellectual face, rather triangular. It was a little
pale at the moment, but the pallor was tinged with a sadness
that would appeal to any sensitive young girl. The mirror
trembled, and the reflection suddenly disintegrated and became
all eyebrows and eyes—long thick eyebrows matched by. long,
intelligent eyes. When the eyes and the eyebrows were viewed
as a whole, however, a restless melancholy could be discerned
behind the expression of intelligent awareness. In short, it was
a face to win the love and sympathy of a sentimental girl of,
say, twenty. If it chanced to attract a girl of sixteen like Lin
Pei-shan — lively, innocent, and free from worldly cares — it was
simply because of its well-shaped lips, always parted in a
mysterious smile and always ready with an amusing quip. After
gazing in the mirror awhile, he sighed and snapped the handbag
shut. When he looked up at her again, he found a tender

smile still playing round her lips, and when he looked into her
limpid eyes, he seemed to see all the little confidences and
intimacies he had ever shared with her reflected there. Could
all this be swept away by Wu Sun-fu’s or his wife’s “dis-
approval,” then? Never! He was suddenly filled with an excite-
ment and a boldness such as he had never known before.

“Pei-shan! Oh, oh, Pei-shan!” he cried, suddenly grasping
her hand.

Interpreting this cri du coeur as just another of his customary
endearments, she neither moved nor spoke, but merely glanced
at him in reply. She had a far-away look in her eyes, and was
clearly thinking of something else, something far removed from
the present scene. But Fan Po-wen had no inkling of this. Her
hand seemed warmer and softer than ever before, and the mere
touch of it set him a-tingle. Although it was quite commonplace
for them to hold hands, at this moment it held a strange attrac-
tion for him. He moved his head closer, intending to steal a
kiss, but as he was almost touching her cheek, his courage sud-
denly failed him: he was afraid of being snubbed. He covered
his embarrassment by repeating lamely:

“But why should Pei-yao now object to it?”

“Oh, dear! Didn’t I just tell you I don’t know?”

Her reply came quickly, as if she was surprised at the question.
Then she smiled again. Her reply was tempered with a certain
warmth, which he took to imply: “It’s entirely up to you. To
me, it’s all the same.” His heart gave a leap and his face flushed
hotly. He looked at her with desire in his eyes, from her face
down to her breasts and from her breasts back up to her face:
Everything radiated a youthful charm and an irresistible warmth
and softness. A sudden idea flashed into his bewildered mind:
just a little firmness on his part, and she would yield, wouldn’t
she? He was about to put his idea into action, when he. was
startled by a rustle in the clump of cypresses behind them. He
started nervously, and his boldness suddenly evaporated.

A cool breeze sprang up, and birds were twittering in the
trees opposite. A flock of pigeons fluttered down on to the grass
in front of them and began strutting about, stopping now and
then to cock their heads on one side and look at the young
couple. Fan Po-wen shifted his attention to the pigeons. There

was something of the poet about their deportment, and he was
tempted to write a short poem about it.

Lin Pei-shan, who seemed to be deep in thought all this time,
suddenly gave a strange little laugh, as if to herself, and gently
withdrew her hand from his. “I want to go back now,” she
suggested as she stood up. “I’ve been sitting on this hard bench
so long that I’m stiff all over.”

His poetic mood was immediately extinguished. He stood up
and looked at her in bewilderment, wondering why she was
in such a hurry. Though sitting in the park had not contributed
materially to the solution of his problem — twice he had made
up his mind to take the plunge and each time his courage had
failed him — yet how poetic it had been, just the two of them
quietly sitting there alone! He would have preferred to stay
there, but he did not want to disagree with her (he had always
done as she suggested), so he just heaved a disgruntled sigh.

In the ordinary way, his gentle passive resistance would have
made her say something which he could have used to bring
about a favourable turn in the situation. But today she was
not her usual self: she just took her handbag from him and
declared icily:

“T really do want to go home! I’m just fed up with every-
thing here!” Without waiting for his reply, or even asking him
to accompany her, she turned on her heel and walked briskly
towards the park gate. In a few seconds she was out of sight
among the trees. He went after her a short way and looked
all round, but there was no sign of her.

*

He stood in frustration for a few moments, not knowing what
to do for the best. At first he thought of running straight to
the park gate and waiting for her there. But his masculine
pride — the wounded pride of a young man when snubbed by a
girl with whom he had been on good terms—stopped him.

Fan Po-wen walked disconsolately on through the park, look-
ing as if he had lost something. The sun was sinking fast and
couples began streaming into the park. They brushed past him,
chattering and laughing, and seemed to be sneering at him and
giving him suspicious glances. He envied and hated them at
the same time, especially the men, who looked just like the rich,
potbellied businessmen that he so despised. He felt quite out of
place in such self-confident, arrogant company.

Now, should he go back to Wu Sun-fu’s place and dally with
her again? No, he thought, no self-respecting man would do
that! What about going back to his room in the Tai Lai Hotel,
then? No, that was the last thing he wanted to do. Suddenly
this carefree poet wished he had a home to go to--a home with
parents and brothers and sisters; but he had none. He felt
he must be the loneliest man in the world. Then, true to the
time-honoured tradition among depressed poets, an idea began
to form in his mind: death. He paced along with bent head,
his fertile imagination toying with the idea of dying. To think
of him, a young poet with a carefree air which would make any
girl’s heart flutter, suddenly dying in front of all the members
of the fair sex who were gracing the park on this lovely May
evening! What a shock that would be for them! Would it not
bring every female in the park, all the shy, soulful, sentimental
young girls, to weep tears of sympathy over his handsome dead
body—or, at least, make their dear hearts beat faster? Would
that not be the most fitting, the most poetic death a poet could
die? He could imagine no better way of turning his sorrow
into happiness and his defeat into victory!

As luck would have it, a conveniently placed pond lay just
ahead. This was as good a place as any, for all the young couples
would stop when they reached this point, to sit on the benches
round the pond. “I’ll do what the great poet Chu Yuan* did!”
he thought, as he made quickly for the pond; but, to his dis-
appointment, there were hardly any suitable girls on the benches
to witness the tragedy. Several foreign children were sailing a
toy boat on the pond. A girl in white and a boy in grey were
launching a handsome two-foot yacht. Its three red silk sails
bellied out in the wind as the yacht sailed majestically away,
leaving a faint trail of white in its wake, while the children
ran along the bank beside it, whooping and laughing.

* A great Chinese poet (340-278 B.C.). Exiled because of his patriot-
ism and fearless criticism of the collaborationists, he finally drowned
himself.

Fan Po-wen’s poetic mood suddenly returned, and he soon had
a couple of decent lines of poetry. All thought of suicide vanished
from his mind as he decided that the poem was well worth
finishing, but before he could work out the third line, the wind
veered and a sudden gust made the little yacht heel over and
capsize,

To. tell the truth, Fan Po-wen was even more dismayed and
upset at this unexpected disaster than the children themselves.
On the voyage of life, he thought, one is often caught in such
squalls, squalls which can capsize one’s little boat. Man, poor
creature, is nothing more than the sport of the inscrutable wind
of fortune. Again he steeled himself, stepped back with a flour-
ish, and tensed himself for a plunge into the pond. But just then
he -was seized by a sudden doubt, a doubt miraculously rein-
forced by the sound of a voice calling him from behind.

He straightened up and looked round to find Wu Chih-sheng
standing just behind him and smiling at him.

Hardly knowing why, Fan Po-wen blushed, and stole a glance
at Wu Chih-sheng’s face and was relieved to see that his friend
had apparently not realized his intention. He smiled as naturally
as he could as he went across to greet him.

“On your own?” said Wu Chih-sheng. “Just watching children
playing, eh?”

Was there just a hint of suspicion in his voice? Whatever it
was, there was something odd in the way he said this.

Fan Po-wen gave a silent and evasive nod, but Wu Chih-
sheng pressed him further, “Really alone?”

Fan Po-wen again nodded and fcrced an uneasy smile. He
wanted to escape, but decided after all that Wu Chih-sheng’s
company was perhaps preferable to roaming up and down alone.
He only hoped his friend would talk about something else. As
if in answer to his prayer, Wu Chih-sheng immediately changed
the subject.

“Have you heard about Chang Su-su? I thought you told me
the other day that she was often brimming over with poetic
sentiments —”

“Why? what’s the matter with her now? Down with the
plague?”

“No, she’s not the type to be infected so easily! No, the trouble
is, she can’t get on with Li Yu-ting. The professor doesn’t
measure up to her expectations and she’s quite down in the
mouth about it.”

At this news Fan Po-wen laughed gleefully. He felt grateful
to Wu Chih-sheng for telling him, and became his usual face-
tious self again.

“But of course!” he said. “It was as inevitable as one and
one making two! How could a girl like Su-su, who craves for
‘strong stimulation,’ ever be satisfied with a dry-as-dust pro-
fessor? But I’m surprised at her, of all people, letting it get her
down! It isn’t worthy of her poetic spirit!”

“But Professor Li’s just as disappointed in Chang Su-su, you
know!”

“What! That dull schoolmaster so good that he —?”

“He’s certainly very good at some things — money matters, for
instance,”

“Oh!... So it’s a question of money, is it?”

“Of course! He’s heard that her father’s practically broke now,
so he’s every reason to be disappointed in her.”

When he heard this, Fan Po-wen stared in open-mouthed
amazement for a moment, then suddenly burst out laughing.

“Humph!” he shrugged. “These bourgeois make me sick with
their ‘money’!”

“That’s because you make them sick with your modern poetry!”
said Wu Chih-sheng sardonically, but with assumed seriousness.
Fan Po-wen flushed, then immediately paled. He glared resent-
fully at Wu Chih-sheng and turned to walk away. He seemed
genuinely upset, but he had only a couple of yards when he
turned and came back. He laid his hand on Wu Chih-sheng’s
shoulder, and said in a low, serious voice:

“I hear they’re going to make a match between you and Lin
Pei-shan.”

Wu Chih-sheng’s face registered nothing. He glanced uncon-
cernedly at Fan Po-wen, and replied unhurriedly, “Oh, but I’ve
heard a different story.”

“What’s that? Come on, out with it!”

“In this modern age men choose their women, but women also
choose their men. Men toy with women, but women also toy
with men!”

Fan Po-wen’s face fell and he was tempted to walk away.
He decided this was his unlucky day: everywhere he turned, he
ran up against a brick wall. It was exasperating. Even his
sense of humour seemed to have deserted him, leaving him in
an irritable mood. But Wu Chih-sheng pretended not to notice.

“To tell you the truth,” he said solemnly, looking Fan Po-wen
straight in the eye, “Lin Pei-shan’s waiting for you.”

Fan Po-wen started violently, supposing that she hadn’t gone
home after all, but was still in the park waiting for him.

“Where’s she waiting for me?” he asked agitatedly.

“In her heart, of course —She’s waiting for you to get the Nobel
Prize for Literature!”

As he said this, Wu Chih-sheng burst out laughing. Without
a word, Fan Po-wen turned on his heel and stalked away, this
time in earnest, and disappeared into the trees. Wu Chih-sheng
gazed after him with a smile, but he couldn’t help feeling a lit-
tle amazed that the poet should stalk off in a rage like this,
without even a glance over his shoulder, He waited a minute
or two until he was sure that the poet was gone for good, then
ran up on to a mound hidden in a clump of trees lying back
from the pond.

“tHuei-fang!” he called. “It’s getting late. We'll have to get
a move on if you want to see the zoo.”

Huei-fang was leaning against a willow, dabbing her eyes with
a handkerchief. Without a word, and with only a glance at Wu
Chih-sheng, she followed him out of the trees. Her eyes were
red from crying. When they had gone a short way, she caught
up with him and asked him faintly, “Chih-sheng, was he going
to throw himself into the pond? He looked as if he was.”

“1 didn’t ask him.”

“Why not? Well, you should have done, then.—When we were
following him just now, he kept behaving strangely, all the way
here. I thought then that there was something wrong. And
when we met Lin Pei-shan on the way in, she looked a bit out

of sorts, too. aa

Wu Chih-sheng burst out laughing. He gazed at his cousin a
moment before he went on:

“Fan Po-wen will never commit suicide, though he’s threatened
to do so over and over again. When you thought he was con-
templating suicide, he was actually composing a poem—QOde to
a Pond, perhaps. No, a poet like him would never really take
his own life. You needn’t worry about him!”

“Humph! I should worry! It’s no concern of mine! Though—”

She blushed as she stopped short and walked on with bent
head. Deep down in her heart she held a picture of Fan Po-wen
as a gentle creature deserving of sympathy. She fell back be-
hind Wu Chih-sheng again. When they had gone a little farther,
she sighed softly, and, a tear trickled down her cheek.

*

An indefinable sadness had come over Huei-fang these last few
days. Her heart seemed as taut as a drum, and the slightest
stimulus from others’ joy or sorrow set it vibrating in sympathy.
When she was alone in her room, she felt numbed by an icy
despair. In company, she felt out of place and nervous, as if
everyone was brow-beating her. She felt quite alone in the
world, and wanted more than anything a sympathetic friend, so
that she could fling her arms round his neck and cry her eyes
out, and pour out all her troubles to him. These few days in
Shanghai had seemed an eternity. Her heart was full, but there
was no one to tell.

Perhaps it was her loneliness, and this alone, that made her
sympathize so easily with the love-lorn Fan Po-wen. However,
as she walked along with Wu Chih-sheng, her own troubles and
the changing scenes and faces about her gradually drove the
poet’s dear, sad face from her mind. At the zoo, she was at-
tracted by a bear in a cage—a huge, black thing pacing to and
fro like a philosopher, then rearing up on its hind legs and shak-
ing its big clumsy head like an idiot. This made her smile, and
for a moment she forgot even her own unhappiness.

Wu Chih-sheng ran across a fellow-student and fell into con-
versation with him. His friend, a brilliant-looking youngster
despite his tousled head of hair, kept glancing at Huei-fang as

they talked together. Their voices gradually dropped to a whis-
per, but she caught occasional snatches without really paying
much attention to what they were saying.

“Your flancée?”

“No—my cousin!”

Huei-fang blushed. Though she did not understand the for-
eign word “fiancée” she guessed what it meant from Wu Chih-
sheng’s answer. She turned away embarrassed and walked over
to a cage in which she saw a family of monkeys leaping and
gambolling about. They reminded her of a troupe of perform-
ing monkeys she had seen several years before at a temple fair
at home. She could still remember one of them—it kept grin-
ning and showing a mouthful of gleaming white teeth. That was
her last, happy memory of the temple for when she was fourteen
and already looked a well-developed young lady, her father, the
late Old Mr. Wu, would not let her go to the temple fairs any
more because he thought the sexes mingled too freely there.
Now, at the sight of all these monkeys, memories of her child-
hood days came flooding back, and she just stood there dreamily
in front of the cage, looking to see whether one of the monkeys
would grin at her.

But of all these monkeys not one grinned. They seemed to
have acquired something of a townsman’s nervousness, for all
they seemed to be doing was scuttling and leaping all over the
place and chattering hysterically. Huei-fang was rather disap-
pointed, and she was just going to turn away and look for Wu
Chih-sheng, when something unusual caught her eye. On a
wooden box in the corner of the cage were two monkeys, one
lounging lazily on its back and the other hunting for lice in the
first one’s fur, a serious expression on its face. You could tell
from their intimate manner that there was some close link be-
tween them, she thought—yes, that was it! They were husband
and wife! Huei-fang just stood there and gazed at them, while
an indescribable mixture of feelings tumbled through her mind:
something akin to gladness—or was it desolation? It was both
of these and a sort of empty yearning besides. She did not dare
look, yet she could not bear to tear her eyes away: she just
stood there in a trance, until roused by Wu Chih-sheng’s voice.

“Come on, they’re closing in a minute.”

Startled, she turned her head and gazed blankly at Wu Chih-
sheng, not really taking in what he said. Then a sudden blush
spread from her tender dimpled cheeks over her whole face.

She felt ashamed and flustered, as if he had read her secret
thoughts. She was on the verge of crying, but managed to blink
the tears away. Without a word she turned and walked blindly
on. The zoo had become almost deserted, but she was quite
unaware of the fact. She had only gone a few steps, when she
came to a seat. She sat down dazedly and buried her face in
her handkerchief.

“Huei-fang, are you feeling all right?” asked Wu Chih-sheng
softly, obviously blind to what was going on inside her. “The
zoo is closing at five, and the keepers are coming round to turn
us out.”

This blindness of his was hardly to be wondered at, for he had
only mixed with modern city girls like Lin Pei-shan and Chang
Su-su and so, of course, was a complete stranger to the secret
sorrows and emotions of old-fashioned “boudoir maidens” like
Huei-fang. What was surprising, however, was that his very
ignorance gave Huei-fang a sense of relief, and she gathered
some comfort from his gentle, sympathetic voice. She uncovered
her face and smiled bravely up at him with tear-bright eyes,
then stood up and replied with a trace of shyness:

“I’m all right now—let’s go home, then.”

The sun was already disappearing below the horizon, the eve-
ning breeze was cool and exhilarating, and every moment brought
a fresh wave of visitors into the park. Wu Chih-sheng would
have preferred to stroll about a little longer, or go and have a
drink at the soda-fountain which had been set up under a mat
awning, but Huei-fang was shy of the large crowds, especially
those young couples who always seemed to be looking at her so
suspiciously. She insisted on going home, though she knew she
would not be any happier when she got there.

They were walking back past the pond, where all the benches
were now fully occupied, when they noticed a young man sitting
on the grass against a tree not far from the pond, his head bent
as if he was having a nap. Even from a distance, Huei-fang’s
sharp eyes told her that it was Fan Po-wen. She glanced at
Wu Chih-sheng inquiringly. Wu Chih-sheng, who had also spot-

ted him, smiled at her and nodded, then crept up behind Fan
Po-wen and clapped his hands over his eyes from behind.

“Take your hands away! Who is it? Stop messing about

Fan Po-wen’s protests were half-hearted and he made no at-
tempt to move. Huei-fang came up behind Wu Chih-sheng and
stood watching for a moment, then stepped lightly round the
tree and stood beside Fan Po-wen. Wu Chih-sheng only held
his hands tighter over Fan Po-wen’s eyes, though he could not
help laughing.

“Wu Chih-sheng, is it? I’d know that laugh anywhere. If
I’ve guessed wrong, you can cut my head off!”

“you didn’t have to guess: I gave myself away.—-Now, guess
who’s here with me.”

This time, Fan Po-wen refused to guess. He just struggled to
shake himself free, while his face became quite red from his
exertions.

“Let go of him, Chih-sheng!” pleaded Huei-fang, feeling sorry
fot Fan Po-wen. But as she spoke, Fan Po-wen finally managed
to break Wu Chih-sheng’s hold, and sprang to his feet rubbing
his eyes. When he turned round, he saw Huei-fang; he grasped
her hand and said with a polite bow:

“you’ve saved my life, Miss Wu! I’m deeply grateful to you

She hurriedly snatched her hand away and turned her back on
him, while a sudden blush spread over her cheeks. However,
she could not help asking timidly:

“So you haven’t gone back after all, Mr. Fan. What have you
been doing here all alone?”

“Er—composing poems,” he answered, tilting his head on one
side and looking up at the sky, as. if, oblivious of everything
else, he was absorbed in reciting his poems mutely to himself.
Wu Chih-sheng was greatly amused at this, but managed to keep
a straight face as he threw Huei-fang a meaning look. Fan Po-
wen sighed and stamped his foot, then went up to Huei-fang and
began:

“Whenever I’m in low spirits I take comfort in poetry. My
poems are my tears. And the worse I feel, the better are my
poems.—And now, just as I was putting the finishing touch to
& wonderful poem, this lout Chih-sheng had to come along and
break the spell. Now I’ve forgotten every word of it!”

”

yp

As she hung upon his every word, Huei-fang gazed at his pale
but stirring face, while her heart fluttered with a strange sensation
which she never before experienced.

“All right, then,” Wu Chih-sheng broke in indifferently: “I'll
leave you to your versifying. Good-bye!”

He turned and walked away, swinging his arms. After a mo-
ment’s hesitation, Huei-fang gave Fan Po-wen a lingering glance
and reluctantly followed Wu Chih-sheng. Fan Po-wen gazed
after them until they had almost disappeared into the crowd,
then, with a sudden laugh, he ran after them and caught up with
them.

“I don’t feel like composing now,” he said, with a suggestion
of pleading in his voice, as he caught Wu Chih-sheng by the arm.
“Mind if I tag along?”

“But we're going home now,” said Huei-fang, who usually
waited for Wu Chih-sheng to speak first. She smiled shyly at
Fan Po-wen, then hurriedly dropped her eyes.

“Then I'll... I'll come along to your place, too,’ Fan Po-wen
decided after a moment’s hesitation.

They did not talk much on the way. When they reached Wu
Sun-fu’s house, the porter was just closing the black iron gate,
but, when he saw who it was approaching, he pulled it open
again.

“There’s some people here from Shuangchiao Town, Miss,” he
said with a grin. “They said they got out by the skin of their
teeth.”

This news immediately roused Huei-fang from her day-dream-
ing. With. a little cry of surprise she darted into the house.
Three days before she had overheard Wu Sun-fu telling some-
body the bad news about her home town, but it had been so
unexpected that she had not thought it could be at all serious,
and had dismissed it from her mind. Now she seemed to realize
suddenly that something terrible had actually happened, and her
face paled at the thought.

*

She found a crowd of people gathered in the large drawing-
room, standing about and talking excitedly. Her eyes first fell
on Fei Little Beard. The old man was standing there in a grey
gown, doing his best to answer a barrage of questions from Mrs.

Wu Sun-fu and Ah-hsuan at the same time. Huei-fang went
over to them and stood watching Fei Little Beard gasping and
gesticulating.

“tt was at eight o’clock, er, no, nine— that’s it, nine o’clock,
Madame, that the Hung Chang Pawnshop went up in flames.—
If Colonel Ho’s two machine-guns hadn’t been there, the rioters
and the soldiers who’d mutinied wouldn’t have set fire to the
shop — don’t you think so, Madame? The machine-guns were up
on the turret blazing away like anything but it wasn’t any use!—”

“I say, Fei Little Beard!” interrupted Ah-hsuan, tugging at his
arm. “What happened to my picture-books? I had them in a
box you haven’t told me yet what happened to them.”

Fei Little Beard could only stare at Ah-hsuan blankly, since he
had not the slightest idea what “picture-books” he meant. Mrs,
Wu Sun-fu laughed, while Huei-fang took the opportunity to get
a word in: “Is it true that the whole town’s been ransacked?
I wouldn’t believe it—a town as big as that! Was it just the
pawnshop that was burned down? What about our house?”

“Our house wasn’t touched, Huei-fang,” Mrs. Wu Sun-fu as-
sured her. “But now we'd better let Mr. Fei have a rest—he
must be very tired after all he’s gone through. We can talk
about it later when Sun-fu comes home. But really, a mutiny!”

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu looked suddenly worried, as if she was wres-
tling with some knotty problem. She stood staring blankly into
space for a moment, then pulled herself together and forced an
unnatural smile. She waved Fei Little Beard to a seat, and then
slipped out.

Ah-hsuan started pestering Fei Little Beard about his box of
picture-books again, while Huei-fang turned her attention to a
group of young men by the window—Fan Po-wen, Wu Chih-
sheng, Tu Hsueh-shih, and a stranger in a foreign suit—all listen-
ing to a man who was telling them how the rioters and
mutineers had attacked the pawnshop. Huei-fang thought his
voice sounded familiar but she could not place him just from
the view she had of his back. Suddenly he turned and she could
see his profile: a long horse-like face with a snub-nose, stand-
out ears and bristly shock of hair. She saw at once that it was
Tseng Chia-chu, and it was as much as she could do to suppress
a startled cry at the sight of him, for she had always loathed

him. Despite the fact that he was posing as a refugee and was
being regarded with sympathy, Huei-fang still had no wish to
see him, and she wished even less to be drawn into conversation
with him. After some hesitation, she went through into the
dining-room and sat down near the open door with her back to
the young men and strained her ears to catch their conversation.

“So you snatched a pistol from a mutineer,” came Fan Po-wen’s
sarcastic voice, “and had to shoot a few peasants before you
could make your way out of the town, eh? Whew! What a hero!”

“Yes, I know how to look after myself all right!”

“But what about your father?” asked Tu Hsueh-shih in a
voice even more caustic than Fan Po-wen’s had been, his cat-eyes
glaring indignantly as he spoke. “With your immense courage
you should have had no trouble at all in getting him out of
danger. But you only managed to save your own skin. And
you didn’t worry about your wife and child, either!”

Tseng Chia-chu had not expected a rebuff like this, and for
all his boasting he was now beginning to feel that the situation
was becoming embarrassing. Yet, being a born liar, he was
unruffled and ready with a brazen reply:

“Oh, that. . . . They’re quite safe where they are. Not
many people know them, and anyway, they can always go and
hide with some good friends of ours if things get worse. Not
like me: I’m well known all over the town. Wherever I go,
there’s somebody who knows me. Who doesn’t know me, Mr.
Tseng, Junior?”

“Would you please tell us your official position in Shuangchiao
Town, Mr. Tseng, Junior? You must be the mayor: I’m sure
you wouldn’t accept anything less, would you?”

This was another cut from Fan Po-wen. As he spoke, he
nudged Wu Chih-sheng and winked at Tu Hsueh-shih.

The young man in the foreign suit just stood looking on, a
cold smile on his lips and an expression of general discontent
on his face. He was Tu Hsin-to, Tu Chu-chai’s eldest son and
Tu Hsueh-shih’s nephew, a student just back from Paris.

Tseng Chia-chu’s embarrassment was increasing with every
minute. Ignoramus though he was, he knew there was no such
official as mayor in his town, so he was rather surprised at Fan
Po-wen’s compliments. But when he looked closely at Fan Po-

wen, he changed his mind and told himself that this imposing,
well-dressed man must have had some reason for his remarks
and that he himself, ignorant as he was of such matters, must
be mistaken. He smiled uneasily and tried to look important.
Little caring whether he was overstepping the mark with his
boasting, he replied without batting an eyelid:

“Yes, of course I’m the —er—the mayor of the town. You're
quite right I wouldn’t be satisfied with anything less than that.
Stands to reason. What’s more, I’m number twenty-three, look
at this!”

He laid special stress on the word “this,” but nobody appeared
to understand what he meant. He quickly fished out of his
pocket two cards: his visiting card and his party card. He laid
these cards on the upturned palms of his grubby paws and held
them out for inspection. His party card was soiled and. crum-
pled, but his visiting card was brand-new as he had had it
printed overnight during the three days he had spent in the
county town after his flight from Shuangchiao Town. Tu Hsueh-
shih snatched the cards and was just going to look at them more
closely, when Fan Po-wen burst out laughing, for his sharp eyes
had not only spotted the party card but also the small charac-
ters on the visiting card identifying its owner as party member
No. 23 of such and such district branch in such and such a
county.

When Tu Hsueh-shih also saw these details, he flung the cards
angrily on the floor.

“Rubbish!” he snapped. “It’s people like you that have
ruined the country!”

“Don’t be so rude, Hsueh-shih!” broke in Wu Chih-sheng, who
had remained silent till now. “Don’t you realize that these cards
are more precious than one’s father, wife, and child put together?”

Then, with a contemptuous glance at Tseng Chia-chu, he
grasped Fan Po-wen by the arm and pulled him into the dining-
room. Tu Hsueh-shih and Tu Tsin-to followed them, the former
kicking the door shut behind him with a bang.

The four of them made a beeline for a sofa under the window,
and sat down without noticing Huei-fang sitting quietly by the
door. They just sat and roared with laughter, while Tu Hsueh-
shih continued his imprecations against Tseng Chia-chu. Fan

Po-wen happened to be sitting directly opposite Huei-fang, so
he was the first to notice her. He hurriedly stood up and planted
himself in front of the other three.

“Guess who else is in the room besides us!’ he said.

“Nobody,” came Wu Chih-sheng’s swift reply. “Unless it’s
your love-lorn muse who’s never absent from your mind for a
single moment.”

But Fan Po-wen, refusing to be drawn, just stepped aside to
reveal a blushing Huei-fang. Wu Chih-sheng stood up and said
the first thing that came into his head to cover up his embarrass-
ment:

“Huei-fang, meet Tu Hsin-to, Brother-in-law Chu-chai’s son.”

“He’s a student just back from France, Doctor of God-knows-
what, versed in sericulture and apiculture, artist, Bakuninist, and
—” Fan Po-wen had intervened to enumerate Tu Hsin-to’s titles,
but broke off in the middle and burst out laughing.

Tu Hsin-to neither laughed nor showed any embarrassment.
Instead, he bowed gravely to Huei-fang and held out his hand.
When he saw that she was keeping her hands at her side, and
that she returned his bow rather awkwardly, he smiled pieas-
antly and let his hand drop. He had only been back in the
country three days, but he knew how complicated Chinese so-
ciety was. It was, perhaps, for this very reason that he had been
in a dozen or so schools during his four years in France and had
tried his hand at a variety of subjects: horticulture, poultry-
farming, apiculture, mining, water conservancy, textile manu-
facture, ship-building, war chemistry, politics, economics,
literature, philosophy, the fine arts, medicine, applied chemistry
and so on and so forth. To each subject he had devoted a few
days or even a few weeks, and so had earned the title of “Doctor
of God-knows-what.” If he had acquired anything in particular
in France, it was his own version of Bakuninism —a philosophy
of life which amounted to “I don’t like anything and I don’t care
about anything.” And this, of course, was just another aspect
of his “wide learning.”

Had he any ideals? Yes, plenty. To be more accurate, when
he was lying in bed, his head swarmed with ideals; but the
moment he left his bed, all that was left was his attitude of “I

don’t like anything and I don’t care about anything.” He was
not a great talker, but he was quite a mild, affable sort of man.

Fan Po-wen, Wu Chih-sheng, and Tu Hsueh-shih fell silent, not
knowing how to carry on the conversation before the young lady.
Although Tu Hsin-to did not like to push himself forward and
hold forth in company, when he saw that no one seemed willing
to say anything he thought there would be no harm in saying
something to liven up the atmosphere.

“Anyone who’s new to Shanghai,” he began lightly, and with
a smile, “must find it rather. incredible. It’s a hotbed of all sorts
of ideologies... . Look at Monsieur Tseng, for instance. You
all think him disgusting, but, actually, a man like that is to be
pitied, too. — Aunt Huei-fang, you must know what he’s like: am
I right about him?”

Huei-fang was surprised at being called “aunt” by a man
several years older than herself, and found herself giggling with
embarrassment. Fan Po-wen also laughed and clapped Tu Hsin-to
on the shoulder.

“Now don’t you start calling me ‘uncle’!” he warned him. “I
was afraid you might any moment!”

“There you go again, Po-wen!” cried Tu Hsueh-shih. “It’s
people like you who do nothing but joke that are ruining the
country!—And as for that fellow Tseng, he’s really shocking. It
makes me furious just to think about him. Didn’t I tell you
when we saw him arrive that he was a rotter? Well, now we've
proved it! I’d like to give him what for. If it had been any-
where but here, I’d have given him a good hiding.”

As he spoke, he glared round and puffed out his cheeks, so that
he looked perfectly ridiculous, as he always did when he was
angry. It was now Fan Po-wen’s turn for another quip.

“That’s right! Give him what for! You’re just the right man
for the job. You can hit him with the ‘mailed fist? yow’re always
talking about, but he can take it, because he’s so thick-skinned!”

“I quite agree with you, Mr. Tu,” broke in Huei-fang. “Mr.
Tseng is really horrible. He has such shifty eyes.—Oh, I wish
I knew how things really are at home!”

She had thrown off her shyness to say this because she was
afraid that Tu Hsueh-shih and Fan Po-wen were going to start
quarrelling. Her interruption had divertéd the conversation to

Shuangchiao Town for a while. Tu Hsin-to remained reticent
and looked on with an indifferent smile, though he nodded his
appreciation of Fan Po-wen’s witticism. They were, in a way,
the best of friends. Tu Hsueh-shih disliked his nephew just
as much as he did Fan Po-wen. He said harshly to the latter:

“You just keep your mouth shut, Po-wen! Freedom of speech
is China’s curse. Too many cooks spoil the broth, you know.
Our only hope is to put the reins of government into iron hands,
and put a stop to all this idle chatter. The reason why bandits
are always on the rampage is because our military commanders
are not doing their job properly. As likely as not some of them
are even giving the bandits a free hand so that they'll have a
chance of distinguishing themselves—”

“Yes, but everyone’s got to live-—even a bandit,” interposed
Wu Chih-sheng. “There’s no two ways about it. The reason
why there are so many bandits about isn’t as simple as you
might think.”

Wu Chih-sheng firmly believed that, as long as the problem of
distribution of wealth remained unsolved, China—and, indeed
the whole world—would remain in chaos.

“Yes, everyone’s got to live,” agreed Fan Po-wen. “But I
think the root of all the trouble is money. It’s because of
money that Shuangchiao Town’s been attacked and looted. It’s
because of money that capitalists are building factories where
there used to be paddy fields. The smoke from factory chimneys
blots out the-sky and pollutes the beauties of nature. And it’s
because of money that peasants leave their lovely villages and
crowd into the city to live in grimy rabbit-warrens and submerge
their humanity!”

As Fan Po-wen once more gave vent to his poet’s longing for
unspoiled natural beauty, he glanced at Huei-fang. She did not
understand much of what he was saying, but, when she saw the
look of utter sadness on his face, she warmed to him and a
spontaneous smile of sympathy came to her lips.

Tu Hsueh-shih’s mouth was working with impatience and he
was just going to cut Fan Po-wen short, when Lin Pei-shan
burst into the room, bag in hand, apparently just back from a
stroll. Her first words were: “Have you seen the wild horse

and the clay idol in the other room? I thought I’d come to the
wrong house!”

Everyone roared with laughter. Lin Pei-shan twirled round
to see Fan Po-wen and Tu Hsueh-shih. Her gaiety suddenly
vanished. Pressing her lips together in a wry smile, she swept
across the room and out through the back door.

She ran upstairs and burst into her sister's room. The light-
blue satin curtains were drawn and the room was in darkness.
She touched the switch and the sudden blaze of light roused her
sister, who was lying back on a sofa in a reverie.

The sisters looked at each other in silence, then Lin Pei-shan
ran across and crouched down beside her sister. She flung
her arms round her neck and whispered anxiously, “Oh, Pei-yao!
He—he said it to me today. What shall I do!”

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu, not understanding who had said what, turned
to look her sister in the face and saw that she looked both anxious
and miserable.

“1 mean Fan Po-wen—he said he loves me!”

“Well, are you in love with him?”

“Me? I don’t know.”

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu could not help laughing. She shook her head,
and extricated herself from Lin Pei-shan’s embrace. She was
going to say something when her sister went on: “I feel I love
everybody and yet nobody.”

“Oh, don’t be silly!”

“Shouldn’t I say that?”

“It may be true, but you shouldn’t think things like that, be-
cause one day you'll have to get married—you’ll have to make up
your mind about someone—someone to be your life companion.”

Lin Pei-shan inclined her head in thought for a moment, then
rose to her feet and said dejectedly, “To be all the time with
one and the same man? How monotonous! Look at you and
Sun-fu—!”

At this Mrs. Wu Sun-fu started with surprise, and a couple
of things she had in her lap tumbled on to the floor: a tattered
copy of The Sorrows of Young Werther and a faded white rose.
As Mrs. Wu Sun-fu gazed down abstractedly at them, her heart-
ache which had been temporarily interrupted by the arrival of
her sister, now came back with renewed vigour.

“Would you say that Sun-fu isn’t terribly keen on Fan Po-wen,
then?” asked Lin Pei-shan at last, though her voice betrayed no
interest. With an effort, Mrs. Wu Sun-fu repressed her own tur-
bulent feelings and looked up at her sister. After a moment’s
silence she answered, ‘Yes: he has in mind another man who, he
thinks, is even more eligible than Fan Po-wen.”

“Is it Tu Hsueh-shih, the one you were telling me about?”

“What do you think of him?”

“I’m sure I don’t know.”

This “don’t know” business perplexed Mrs. Wu Sun-fu until
she noticed an unusual glint in Pei-shan’s eye which made her
decide that her sister was just being shy. She laughed and asked
softly, “Won't you even take your own sister into your con-
fidence? Just say one word and I’ll understand.”

“I think ... if I marry Tu Hsueh-shih, PH always be thinking
of somebody else—”

Lin Pei-shan broke off, and a faint flush crept into her cheeks.
Mrs. Wu Sun-fu felt her own heart beating faster at these words.
Lin Pei-shan tittered nervously, then averted her face, and mut-
tered as if to herself:

“To marry one man and always be thinking of someone else—
wouldn’t that be horrid, Pei-yao!”

As she said this, she flung herself upon Mrs. Wu Sun-fu, put
her hands on her shoulders, and buried her face in hers like a
child. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face was burning hot, and Lin Pei-shan
started back in surprise when she felt it. When she looked and
saw that her sister’s face was flushed and that there were tears
glistening between her lashes, she could only stare in amaze-
ment. Mrs. Wu Sun-fu’s face slowly paled as she saw through
her tears the image of herself before her marriage in her sister
standing before her: the same looks, the same figure, and the
same innocence and vivacity tinged with fantasy as she had had.
And like herself her sister was now at the crossroads, and in
danger of being drawn into a life which did not make sense.
Surely her sister was not destined to share her own fate? She
felt sick at heart as these thoughts went through her mind.

“Pei-shan,” she blurted out tremulously, “who is it you’re al-
ways thinking about? Po-wen?”

“No, it’s not him—oh, I don’t know! Oh, Pei-yao, I want to
cry—I just want to cry!”

Lin Pei-shan flung her arms round Mrs, Wu Sun-fu and hugged
her close as she said this. Her voice trembled but she did not
burst into tears. All at once, she let go of Mrs. Wu Sun-fu with
a nervous giggle and skipped out of the room again.

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu stared at the waving blue curtain cver the
door, then parted her lips to call her sister back, but changed
her mind. Two large tears welled up in her eyes and fell on
to her hand. As she bent her head to look at the book and the
faded white rose lying on the carpet at her feet, a wave of over-
whelming sorrow swept over her. She threw herself face down-
wards on the sofa in a daze and moaned miserably,

“ty9w about Pei-shan? Can she be taking my place? ... No,
surely not! Who is it she’s got in mind, then? Oh, my foolish
heart! They say the fighting’s getting worse at the front... .
If he’s killed, it’s finished, finished! — But didn’t he say he’d
come back? Oh, I'll be afraid to see him again.... Oh for-
give me, let me go! Let me go and hide myself somewhere!”
Vil

THREE days later. All the morning not a breath of wind had
stirred. The sky was heavy with becalmed banks of grey cloud,
behind which sidled a watery sun. Dragon-flies zigzagged among
the trees, bumping from time to time against the greyish-green
wire-netting screens over the windows and startling the flies
which had settled there, so that they flew up with a buzz and
circled aimlessly around in front of the windows awhile, before
settling again to crawl on the screens, where they would stretch
out their hind legs and rub them slowly together as if they were
deep in thought.

Inside the wire-screened windows was the Wus’ luxuriously
furnished drawing-room, with Wu Sun-fu pacing up and down,
his face as clouded as the sky. Suddenly he stopped and looked
up at the clock on the wall.

“Eleven already,” he muttered, “and still no ring!”

He had been waiting anxiously for a telephone call from Chao
Po-tao and Tu Chu-chai, for it was today that the fate of their
joint speculation in government bonds would be decided. For
the last few days the market had been buzzing with the news
that the Central Army was beginning to win its battles. But
speculators in general preferred to bide their time; only small
buyers were active, but they could not push up the prices to any
appreciable extent. The day before, the victories of the Central
Army had been splashed across the front page of every news-
paper. This morning, the early session of the Exchange had
opened with a two-to-three-dollar rise on all government bonds.
On the floor a sea of heads pushed and jostled, and the shout-
ing of buyers and sellers made the plate sound like a field of
battle, so that it was impossible to make oneself heard above the
din. The raised hands were all palm-upwards. But Chao Po-

tao needed only to unload about two million to make the prices
drop again to only fifty cents above the quotation of two days
before. People said that the big bears had decided to hold out
until today and see which way the wind was blowing before
buying in. The fate of Wu Sun-fu and his fellow-speculators
would be decided within the next twelve hours, for the settle-
ment was due the following day.

Wu Sun-fu frowned as he looked out through the window at
the sullen sky, then smiled with an air of resignation and strode
into the library to ring up Tu Wei-yueh at the factory. On this
front he was rather more confident of victory, but here, too, today
was the day which would decide the outcome. This morning was
the deadline for Tu Wei-yueh and Mo Kan-cheng to put an end
to the week-old go-slow strike.

He was just picking up the telephone, when the door opened
and a squarish face with a tuft of beard on its chin peered
round the door as if wondering whether to come in or wait
outside. Wu Sun-fu put down the receiver and called out, “Come
on in, Fei. Any reliable news?”

Fei Little Beard squeezed in crabwise, closed the door quietly
and tiptoed across to the desk where Wu Sun-fu was sitting.

“Yes, there’s some,” he muttered timidly, looking down at the
floor. “But it’s not too good. The bandits have withdrawn from
the town and spread out into the surrounding villages. All the
shops in the town are still closed. The troops sent out by pro-
vincial authorities are still stationed in the county town, and
are afraid to come anywhere near—”

“Troops be damned!” Wu Sun-fu interrupted impatiently. “Just
tell me about my losses.” In his agitated state of mind, he found
the cheerless gloom of the room depressing, so he reached across
the desk and flicked on the table-lamp. The light which filtered
through the yellow silk shade picked out his gloomy, purplish
face and his thick eyebrows twitching with anxiety above his
ruthless eyes.

“Oh, yes, the losses .. . er, it hasn’t been possible to make a
clear estimate yet. I’m afraid the losses are considerable—the
Hung Chang Pawnshop, the Tung Yuan local bank, the oil-
refinery, the power-house—”

“I know they’ve been ransacked; you needn’t tell me about that
again! What I want is a detailed list of definite losses, not a
rough estimate! You stayed in the town three days just to teil
me all this, eh! Three days, and you still haven’t made a clear
estimate? Pah!”

Wu Sun-fu became angrier with each word and pounded on
the desk. What made him angry was not so much the losses
he had sustained—he could well afford to dismiss a loss of a
hundred or two hundred thousand dollars with a mere frown—
no; it was Fei Little Beard’s dithering and incompetence that
made him so furious. Moreover, he was on tenterhooks to know
how much money was left over after the losses, so that he
could plan ahead how to tide over his present financial difficul-
ties on the eve of the Dragon-boat Festival.

Seeing that Fei Little Beard was tongue-tied, Wu Sun-fu went
on, “Now, how much do you think we can get back on our
loans?”

“Let me see... sixty per cent, I should think, seeing that
most of the shops in the town haven’t suffered much loss. Only
the rice-shops, the piece-goods shops were cleaned out. Yes, I
think there’s a good chance of getting back sixty per cent. Be-
sides, the county town is still intact—”

“You should have told me all this sooner Wu Sun-fu cut
Fei Little Beard short once more, but he sounded more peaceable
now, and a ghost of a smile passed across his lips. He was
confronted with three major problems: the go-slow strike at the
factory, the Stock Exchange battle, and the rebellion in his
home town. He now had a clue to the third problem, for sixty
per cent of his loans meant about sixty or seventy thousand
dollars in cash at his disposal. It was not a big sum, but, like
a commander-in-chief in planning an offensive, now that he
knew what forces he had in hand, he knew how best to deploy
them for the attack.

“One of the motors in the power-house is damaged—” Fei Little
Beard stammered, hanging his head. However, before he finished
his sentence, there was a sudden fiash of lightning, followed by
a deafening clap of thunder which seemed to rock the room;
and on top of the thunder came a torrential downpour, and Fei
Little Beard’s feeble voice was swallowed up by the angry roar

of the elements. Just then Tu Chu-chai burst into the room, his
goat-like face glistening with beads of sweat.

“Whew, what a thunderstorm!” he exclaimed. “No wonder
the phones are out of order. Your phone’s out, isn’t it, Sun-fu?”

He sat down on a sofa opposite Wu Sun-fu and pulled out a
large handkerchief. He spread it over his face and began wiping
vigorously. This was not just to wipe away the perspiration:
it was something he always did whenever he was in a quandary.

Wu Sun-fu knew at once that something had gone wrong on
the Exchange. He smiled slightly and, strangely enough, he
now felt more at peace in his mind. In another minute or two
he would know whether they had won or whether they had lost.
Though, of course, it was quite natural for a man as far-sighted
and broad-minded as he was to be as cool and calm as usual.
He turned to Fei Little Beard and waved him away.

“Pei, you’d better leave for Shuangchiao Town at once. Collect
as much of the money as you can and bring it back to me without
delay. Don’t worry about the damaged motor in the power-
house: I’ll send someone down to see to it tomorrow. You must
try and get to the town before nightfall. You can hire a motor-
boat, and you leave before one o’clock. That’s all. Off you go!”

“Very good—” Fei Little Beard assented dismally. He had
come ashore from a steam-launch less than an hour back, and
had scarcely had time yet to stretch his legs. Now he was
told to embark again—to crouch in a little boat and to be swayed
and jolted about! To go back to a town surrounded and watched
by armed peasants! This was certainly an unpalatable proposi-
tion. But he knew his hasty-tempered master would brook no
disobedience, so he swallowed his disappointment, and shook
down his gown and left without another word. Wu Sun-fu and
Tu Chu-chai began talking about the day’s events on the
Exchange.

Their conversation was hardly audible against the crash of the
thunder, and the roar of the rain, but by watching Tu Chu-chai’s
lip movements, Wu Sun-fu managed to get the gist of what he
was saying. When the lips stopped for a moment, Wu Sun-fu
laughed bitterly and shouted, “You say there are still new bears
turning up? They must be mad!”

“That’s what’s so queer about it all. I’ve never seen such a
crazy market. Wait and see what happens in the afternoon
session, though.”

“What have we got left in hand?”

“Four or five million. If we unload them, we can stop the rise
and turn it into a drop. If we don’t, we're sunk.”

“Unload the lot, then. Anyway, we shan’t be losing on it.”

“Oh, no? Have you forgotten that we’ve paid out three hun-
dred thousand dollars?”

“No, I haven’t forgotten,” said Wu Sun-fu gloomily, “but the
loss won’t work out at more than eighty thousand dollars apiece,
and we can write that off as ‘military expenses.’”

He stood up and began pacing up and down. The thunder
had stopped by now, but the rain was coming down in torrents
and a wind had sprung up; and to the noise of the storm was
added the howling of the wind in the trees outside. Tu Chu-chai
sat in silence, imagining he was back on the floor of the Exchange
in the seething, bawling crowd with its tense, sweating faces
and its foul, stifling atmosphere. And all this confusion was
caused mainly by Chao Po-tao and himself and the other two
plotting behind the scenes and now they were hoist with their
own petard! It was terrible! Tu Chu-chai shook his head and
sighed.

“TY just can’t understand why so many big bears are still hold-
ing out and refusing to cover. Tomorrow’s settlement day, and
yet this morning new bears were still cropping up!”

“But is it that new bears are cropping up? Or is it just Chao
Po-tao playing a shabby trick?”

As he said this, Wu Sun-fu suddenly turned to look Tu Chu-
chai in the face and thumped the table with his hand. The other
sprang to his feet in dismay. Why had he not thought of this
before? He must have been dazed by the noise and stuffiness
on the floor of the Exchange! His voice was excited and angry
as he replied:

“Oho! So that’s it, is it? Yes, I wouldn’t be at all surprised.
But what an infernal cheek!”

“Yes, we’ve been taken in nicely!”

Wu Sun-fu threw back his head and laughed bitterly, but his
voice was drowned by a sudden clap of thunder. Tu Chu-chai
lit a cigar and puffed vigorously at it before observing slowly:

“Tf it’s true, then Chao Po-tao’s no friend of ours. Anyway,
we won't let him get away with it—But we'd better wait and
see what happens in the afternoon session, Sun-fu. It’s too early
yet to know for certain how things will turn out.”

“Let’s hope so!”

“tts not merely a hope—we’ve a good chance of snatching a
victory at the last minute. I’m going to see Shang Chung-li
right away, and then, after lunch, I'll go along to the Exchange
and see what’s happening.”

Tu Chu-chai rose to go, and Wu Sun-fu followed him out to
the front steps. Just as he was getting into the car, Tu Chu-chai
suddenly stopped, turned round, and pulled Wu Sun-fu back
indoors, where he asked him gravely:

“what news has Fei Little Beard brought back from the town?
What are the losses?”

“He didn’t give me a clear picture—no details.”

“What did you send him straight back for just now?”

“To collect what’s left over,” smiled Wu Sun-fu, his look of
despondency vanishing abruptly. “You see, I’m going to con-
centrate all my financial strength on that trust company and
turn it into a base for big operations.”

Tu Chu-chai hesitated a moment, and then asked, “Are you
really set on going through with this business of Chu Yin-chiu?
Are you sure it isn’t a bit touch-and-go?”

Wu Sun-fu made no reply to this question, and only glanced
at Tu Chu-chai.

“7 admit I don’t know much about industry and so on,” Tu
Chu-chai went on, “but as far as I can see its future isn’t going
to be all roses. Besides, Chu Yin-chiu’s no fool and he knows
quite well his machines and factory buildings are worth more
than five hundred thousand dollars. You don’t imagine he’d let
us take over for only three hundred thousand? Besides, he’s a
bit of a backbiter, and he’d give us a bad name and make things
awkward for us if we tried to force something out of him. I
hear he’s already putting it about that we’re trying to twist
him foul and so on. I met Chao Po-tao just a short while ago,

and he gave me to understand that Chu Yin-chiu was already
negotiating with him for a loan of a hundred and fifty thousand
dollars or so on his machinery so that he can pay back the loan
we made him on his cocoons when it falls due in a month's
time—”

Tu Chu-chai broke off inconclusively and flicked the ash off his
cigar. Then he turned to gaze out of the window at the rain,
which was coming down in sheets, although the sky seemed to
be clearing slightly. When he turned round again, it was to see
Wu Sun-fu smiling mirthlessly.

“And did Chao Po-tao promise him a loan?” Wu Sun-fu
asked.

“He’s probably still thinking it over. Since he’s going in with
us in our company, he’s being very courteous and considerate on
the surface. He said that if a loan to Chu Yin-chiu is harmful
to our interests, he’ll have to refuse it—”

“You must definitely tell him to refuse it, then, Chu-chai.”

“That's just what I wanted to discuss with you. So far as
I can see, the silk industry’s in a bad way just now, so I think
we'd better go carefully. If Chu Yin-chiu can get the money
from Chao Po-tao to pay back his loan, we can let it go at that.”

“No, Chu-chai!” protested Wu Sun-fu, jumping up. “We can’t
just sit back and let things slide!”

A shaft of sunlight escaped through a rift in the clouds behind
the curtain of rain and bathed his face in a yellowish glow.
Wu Sun-fu’s voice rose above the drumming of the rain. “We've
been doing our damnedest to relieve Chu Yin-chiu of his cocoons.
We can’t give up now, just when we've almost got our hands
on them! No, Chu-chai, we can’t just let things slide! Tell
Chao Po-tao to refuse him the loan. Our trust company has the
priority of making him loans: we made a special stipulation
to that effect in the contract of the old loan. In fact, as you may
remember, we let him off with a favourable rate of interest—
a mere five and a half per cent a month—in exchange for that
stipulation. Chu-chai, you must tell Chao Po-tao that he must
respect our contract rights.”

Tu Chu-chai stared at Wu Sun-fu for a moment, then took
the cigar out of his mouth, and said with a sigh, “Well, we shall
see what we can do after we’re through with the most urgent

business. At the moment our stock business is quite a handful.
I’m off to see Shang Chung-li now.”

The rain was easing up and turning to a thick, misty drizzle,
while the sky was more leaden and overcast than ever. And
Wu Sun-fu’s heart felt as leaden as the sky. There was still a
ray of hope, though, since there were so many unpredictable
fluctuations on the Stock Exchange; but the signs of the last two
days, however, seemed to indicate that somebody was out to
kill the bulls—which was really rather odd. There could be only
one explanation: their secret must have leaked out already! Wu
Sun-fu had never trusted Chao Po-tao and now he could not help
suspecting that he was stabbing him in the back. He paced up
and down, his hands clasped behind his back, thinking to him-
self: A gamble on the stock market isn’t much of a risk—unless
you go in with Chao Po-tao, and then you’re taking a very great
risk indeed!

It was now already half past eleven, but Tu Wei-yueh at the
factory had not yet telephoned the expected news of victory.
Since there was no point in worrying about Chao Po-tao and
the stock speculations for the moment, Wu Sun-fu mustered up
his energies to deal with the situation in the. factory. He told
Kao Sheng to ring through, but it turned out that the telephone
was in fact out of order, and it was impossible to get through.
Exasperated, he jumped into his car and left for the factory to
investigate in person.

In the streets, everything beyond a radius of fifteen yards or
so was shrouded by the drizzle and appeared as a misty blur.
The top floors of several tall buildings were visible through the
mist, their windows shimmering with a pale, yellowish light like
rows of great eyes. From a distance they seemed to be floating
in mid-air, like buildings seen in a mirage, instead of being their
usual solid and imposing selves. There seemed to be no end to
this thick mist, and as the car ploughed on through its clinging
dampness the wind-screen became like frosted glass, so that
even the nearest passers-by seemed to be so many grotesque
phantoms; everything had undergone a misty sea-change and
every outline had become blurred.

Wu Sun-fu was slumped back in the right-hand corner of the
car, his left leg sprawled along the seat beside him as he glanced
out of the windows, breathing heavily. Suddenly an unusual
sensation came over him: he was one of the captains of industry,
ruthless and go-ahead—yet were his prospects really anything
more than a mirage — just castles in the air? And what were
the people around him but so many blurred, misshapen figures?
His progress in industry was just like his present journey—an
aimless rush through a blinding mist!

A chilly sensation crept up his spine and spread out until his
face paled and his eyes lost the sheen of courage and keenness.

The car turned in through the factory gates and past the
workshops with their windows dismally lit up by the yellowish
glare from inside. The damp air vibrated with the smooth hum
of machinery. In the ordinary way, this hum would have made
him feel elated and his experienced ear would immediately have
told him the tempo of work, but just now, although his senses
were as alert as ever, his mind was clouded and his heart heavy.

He waited until Kuan, his bodyguard, had opened the car door
for him before he slowly got out. Mo Kan-cheng and Tu Wei-
yueh had already come out to meet him, and when Mo saw how
ashen and grim his face was, his heart sank. Wu Sun-fu glanced
coldly at Mo Kan-cheng and then at Tu Wei-yueh and made
straight for his office.

He called Tu Wei-yueh in first. The young man seemed quite
calm and at his ease as he said, without waiting until he was
spoken to, “Your telephone at home was out of order, sir, and
I couldn’t get througn until ten minutes ago, and by that time
you were already on your way. They got the line back into
service just a bit too late to catch you, unfortunately.”

Wu Sun-fu could not help a slight frown, but he nevertheless
forced a smile. He sensed the implication behind Tu Wei-yueh’s
words: that it was really not necessary for him to come to the
factory at this moment. The arrogant, cocksure young man ob-
viously thought that by dashing over to the factory in such a
fluster, instead of waiting at home for the news of victory (as
they had arranged beforehand), Wu Sun-fu was not showing
absolute confidence in his trusted lieutenant, which was not in
keeping with the time-honoured principle of “If you use a man,

don’t suspect him; if you suspect a man, don’t use him,” and
was not at all the way a really great man went about things.
As he looked into Tu Wei-yueh’s face, Wu Sun-fu secretly
applauded his firmness and astuteness, though he dared not
admit to the young man that the reason he had hurried over so
soon was that he had had qualms about his ability to carry
out his task. He smiled faintly and said reassuringly:

“Well, it’s nearly twelve o’clock, isn’t it? I expected to find
that my commander at the front had been completely victorious,
I’ve come, rather unexpectedly perhaps, to speak to the prisoners,
as it were.”

“Even so, you’ve come just a bit too early, Mr. Wu,” said Tu
Wei-yueh bluntly, his face as calm and impassive as ever.

“What! But didn’t I just hear the machines—~do you mean
to tell me they’re just letting the machines run on as usual, and
going slow the way they’ve been doing the last few days?”

“Please go in and you can see for yourself, sir,’ Tu Wei-yueh
said unhurriedly, as cool and dignified as ever.

Wu Sun-fu snorted and glared at Tu Wei-yueh, his piercing
eyes filled with a mounting rage. But the young man was
unabashed: he just drew himself up and met the glare with a
smile.

“T should like your instructions, sir,” he asked abruptly. “Are
you still set on a ‘peaceful settlement’?”

“Of course I am, but there’s a limit to my patience!”

“T see! ... and you set the deadline for today—you said that
the day before yesterday. But, after all, the workwomen are
human beings—they’ve got their own ideas and feelings. But
what makes things worse is that their ideas are complicated and
their feelings are easily roused. For example, three days ago
they were all for Yao Chin-feng, the girl in Row 12, but today
they’ve turned on her; they’re calling her a stooge and accusing
her of betraying their interests. The situation’s taken a turn for
the worse just now. You probably remember Yao Chin-feng: tall
and thin, little round face, slightly pockmarked, thirtyish, been
here three years and six months? Well, as a matter of fact it
was she who started the strike—”

“Yes, I remember her: the one you were working on to bring
her round.”

“1 did bring her round, but now all the other women are calling
her a stooge in our service, and of course a known stooge is no
earthly use to us. All the work I’ve put in on her for the past
few days has just been wasted.”

Wu Sun-fu snorted, but said nothing.

“We've been very careful about the whole thing,” went on
Tu Wei-yueh, “and only a very few of our people were in the
know; and anyway, Yao Chin-feng still kept up a pretence of
being on the side of the women. I don’t suppose for a minute
the women had the slightest suspicion that their leader had
been bought over, so it’s quite clear that it’s one of our people
who has let on about it.”

“Qh! So that’s it, is it? Have you found out who it was?”

“yes: Hsueh Pao-chu, one of the forewomen. By splitting on
us like that, she’s sabotaged the whole plan.”

“What! One of the forewomen do a thing like that—try to
curry favour with the women? She must be mad!”

“It’s all because of jealousy. Those two women are deadly
enemies—Hsueh Pao-chu is envious of Yao Chin-feng’s merit.”

“Call them in to see me!” snapped Wu Sun-fu, springing to
his feet. But Tu Wei-yueh remained still, waiting for Wu Sun-
fu to cool down and countermand this futile order of his. Wu
Sun-fu stared at Tu Wei-yueh for a while, then slowly recovered
his composure and sat down again.

“The interfering bitch!” he muttered to himself through clenched
teeth. “She’s making more trouble than all the women put
together! So she’s fed up with working for me, eh? — Right:
Wei-yueh, tell Mo Kan-cheng to give this Hsueh woman the
sack!”

“Don’t you think there’s an even better way out than that,
Mr. Wu?”

“Eh? What do you think we ought to do, then?” Wu Sun-fu’s
tone of voice was sharp, as if his patience was finally exhausted.

“I would suggest, Mr. Wu, that you put up a notice announc-
ing three things: double pay for the day of the Dragon-boat Fes-
tival; the discharge of Yao Chin-feng and the promotion of Hsueh
Pao-chu to the rank of supervisor,” Tu Wei-yueh spoke with
deliberation, drawing himself up boldly as he did so. Wu Sun-

fu listened in silence, gazing meditatively into space with nar-
rowed eyes for a short while. Suddenly he laughed and said:

“A counterplot, eh? Are you sure it'll work?”

“Yes, I think so. Since eight o’clock this morning I’ve been
doing my best to patch up the awkward situation created by
Hsueh Pao-chu, and I think I’m getting somewhere at last. I’ve
just remembered: you’ve already approved the double pay. I
hope you'll also agree to the discharge of Yao Chin-feng and the
promotion of Hsueh Pao-chu. Later on we can countermand
these orders; then itll be regarded by the women as a conces-
sion to them and be the means of clearing up the trouble. After
all the trouble we’ve been to to get Yao Chin-feng as our con-
tact among the women, we can’t discard her just like that.”

A sudden blast from the hooter resounded through the factory
making Wu Sun-fu start violently and pale slightly. Didn't fac-
tory workers always sound the hooter as signal for a riot? The
next instant he realized it was the signal for lunch-break, and
his smile of relief also gave his tacit consent to Tu Wei-yueh’s
proposal.

“The trouble will be over by this afternoon, I can assure you,
Mr. Wu. After that there’ll be nothing more to do but give rewards
to a number of people for the help they’ve given us. May I have
your instructions in this connection?”

Tu Wei-yueh laid before Wu Sun-fu a list of recommendations
which he had prepared. The latter ran his eyes over it and then
asked with a frown, “These two fellows Chien Pao-sheng and
Kuei Chang-lin are members of the trade union. Must we give
them rewards as well?”

“Yes, I think we must. They have different backgrounds and
belong to different factions, but this time they’ve managed to
come to an agreement on the question of working for your in-
terests.”

“Agreement? Yes, they’re sure to be in agreement about
tapping me for money; but they’re far from being in agreement
when it comes to fighting for power in the union or taking
advantage of trouble among the women to score off one another.
As a matter of fact, the main reason why this go-slow trouble
has dragged on for nearly a week is that these two scoundrels

have been at loggerheads: they couldn’t agree on working for me
and dealing with the women!”

“But they haven’t quarrelled for the last two or three days.
Chien Pao-sheng’s even taken my advice to yield a bit to Kuei
Chang-lin.”

“That doesn’t mean that they're really out to work for me:
they’re just trimming their sails to the wind, for their own ends.
I could well afford it, but I just won’t give a penny to people
like that.”

With this firm rebuff, Wu Sun-fu snatched up a pen and cross-
ed the two names off the list, then initialled it and handed it
back to Tu Wei-yueh. He stood up and looked out of the
window at the women passing by. He frowned as a disagree-
able momory came back to him, but almost immediately his ex-
pression returned to normal. As he left the office, he enjoined
Tu Wei-yueh once more:

“It’s imperative that the whole thing be settled by tomorrow.
My patience ends today.”

His loud voice and stern expression as he said this made the
clerks gathered in the outer office start with alarm, but by the
time they had weighed the significance of his words, his car was
already purring majestically out through the main gate to a
chorus of derisive jeers from a knot of women standing just
outside.

Tu Wei-yueh immediately called a meeting of Mo Kan-cheng
and three or four of his immediate subordinates, including Kuei
Chang-lin. The news that Wu Sun-fu’s patience was at an end,
and that he had made the next day the deadline for a settlement,
soon spread through the whole factory. The supervisors and
forewomen took this to mean that Wu Sun-fu was intending to
resort to more forceful methods. This was a matter of great ex-
citement for them, for they knew very well that if he abandoned
his policy of “peaceful settlement” for one of compulsion, it
would mean the end, or at least the decline, of the Tu Wei-
yueh régime. Although they did not dare protest openly against
Tu Wei-yueh’s rule, they were not at all happy about it.

Knowing perfectly well what was going on in their minds,
Tu Wei-yueh made a point of telling them first of all that Wu

Sun-fu was not at all satisfied with Chien Pao-sheng and Kuei
Chang-lin. Then he broached the main subject of the meeting:

“Now, Mr. Wu has ordered three things: double pay on the
day of the festival, the dismissal of Yao Chin-feng, and the pro-
motion of Hsueh Pao-chu to the rank of supervisor.”

This announcement was met with incredulous stares from
everyone and a passionate protest from Kuei Chang-lin. “Why,
that’s kicking a man when he’s down! It’s not fair! And what’s
Hsueh Pao-chu done that she should be promoted?”

“It’s not fair on Yao Chin-feng!” broke in Wang Chin-chen,
one of the forewomen. “You ought to have stuck up for her,
Mr. Tu, instead of letting her down like this. You told me to
make up to her, and now she’s got the sack and Hsueh Pao-chu,
the one who's been asking for trouble, has been promoted: what
sense is there in that?”

Indignant as she was at the apparent injustice of it all, she
hardly dared blame it on to Wu Sun-fu, on whose favours she
battened, but had to restrict herself to taking it out on Tu Wei-
yueh.

The latter, however, declined to answer: he just squared his
shoulders and smiled calmly.

“Mr. Wu accuses me of not being able to get on with Chien
Pao-sheng. All right: I admit it. We are enemies. We're both
in the union for a living, but he wants to hog the lot, so of
course I have to fight against him. If Mr. Wu doesn’t care who's
fighting who in the union, and if he’s only interested in clearing
up the trouble with the women, then why does he have to
go and promote Hsueh Pao-chu? She’s trying to throw a spanner
in the works and it’s Chien Pao-sheng who’s behind her egging
her on. He’s jealous of me, and he’s always having a £0 at
me. Everybody knows that.”

As he delivered himself of this long tirade against his rival,
Kuei Chang-lin’s eyes flashed and he almost foamed at the mouth
with excitement, though he adopted a more moderate tone in his
references to Wu Sun-fu, because, of all those present, he him-
self was the only one from the union and was dependent only
on the union for a living, whereas all the others depended on
their employer for their livelihood and naturally did not dare

criticize Wu Sun-fu’s way of doing things in front of Tu Wei-
yueh,

Again Tu Wei-yueh smiled nonchalantly and remained silent.
Mo Kan-cheng said, “Of course, if that’s the way Mr. Wu Sun-
fu wants it, we’ll just have to do it that way. But, Mr. Tu, if
we've got to clear up the trouble today, what are we going to
do about it?”

“That’s what we’re going to discuss now,” replied Tu Wei-
yueh. He flashed a glance at one of the supervisors, Pockmarked
Li, and one of the forewomen, just as they were smiling at him.
They had been Tu Wei-yueh’s new favourites ever since he
“came to power.” He squared his shoulders, glanced rapidly
round the circle of faces, and began in a loud voice:

“Let’s leave the question of Yao Chin-feng and Hsueh Pao-chu
out of it for the moment. Mr. Wu has always been a very fair
man, and I can give you my word for it that he won’t let any-
one down who’s really put their back into it and has his in-
terests at heart. He says that this trouble must definitely be
cleared up by today, and he’s promised double pay over the
festival. The only thing that worries me now is that some of
the hard cases like Ho Hsiu-mei might kick up rough and spoil
the whole show. We must be tough with them and stand no
nonsense. Li, I’ll leave that to you. Just put the wind up them;
that’ll be enough —”

“Just leave it to me!” said Pockmarked Li eagerly, his bushy
eyebrows twitching with glee. He was a member of the under-
world, and at any time he could call up a dozen of “the boys”
for a fight.

“Put the wind up them?” cried one of the forewomen, Wang
Chin-chen, scornfully. “That’s not going to be as easy as you
think! You'll find you’ve got a job on scaring Ho Hsiu-mei and
her lot — you'll find them tougher than you bargained for?”

Pockmarked Li glared indignantly and was just going to argue
about it when Tu Wei-yueh restrained him.

“Wang Chin-chen’s right, you know, Li. The best thing you
can do is to get hold of Ho Hsiu-mei when you get the chance,
and cart her off to the theatre. She’s out at lunch just now, so
you'd better get a move on and get the job done — and mind you
don’t make a hash of it. If you haven’t had your lunch yet, you’d

better get ten dollars from the cashier so that you can treat your
mates to a meal when they’ve finished the job. — And remember:
all this has got to be kept quiet!”

“Kept quiet?” muttered Kuei Chang-lin sarcastically. “You
can’t trust those two so-and-sos Chien Pao-sheng and Hsueh
Pao-chu to keep it quiet—but then sometimes it pays not to keep
things quiet!”

Mo Kan-cheng gave Pockmarked Li his ten dollars, and the
latter departed weil pleased with himself. Tu Wei-yueh gave
Kuei Chang-lin a hard look, but did not say anything, then
turned and asked one of the forewomen, “How did you get on,
Ah-chen?”

“Well, about half of the women think that Yao Chin-feng’s
in the right. They say Hsueh Pao-chu’s a capitalist stooge and
that she’s been spreading rumours just to get Yao Chin-feng
into trouble. And they say that Ho Hsiu-mei is jealous of Yao
Chin-feng and wants to push herself forward.”

“Well done! Now, Ho Hsiu-mei won’t be coming in to work
this afternoon, so I want you to put it round that Mr. Mo’s taken
her to the theatre —”

“What, me?” protested Mo Kan-cheng hastily. “Now, look
here, old man, don’t go dragging me into all this!”

Kuei Chang-lin, Wang Chin-chen and Ah-chen laughed, but
Tu Wei-yueh kept a straight face and patted Mo Kan-cheng re-
assuringly on the shoulder.

“Of course it’s you who'll have to take her to the theatre,”
he assured him. “And now you must go and find Pockmarked
Li— you'll find him somewhere around Ho Hsiu-mei’s place—
and arrange to come on the scene and rescue her when Li’s boys
have lured her away to some out-of-the-way spot. Then all you
have to do is to invite her to the theatre.”

“And what if she refuses?”

“Then you'll have to use your head. Tell her you're just
taking her into the theatre to hide until the wolves have cleared
off. You’re an old man, so she won't suspect you, and she’s
sure to do as you suggest.”

“And what if Mr. Wu gets to hear of it? There'll be hell
to pay!”

“Don’t you worry about that: I'll do any explaining that needs
to be done. Off you go, then! And now, Ah-chen, you run
along and do your bit—and mind you don’t let the cat out of
the bag!”

After they had gone, there were only three people left in
the room: Tu Wei-yueh, Kuei Chang-lin and Wang Chin-chen.
With a wry smile, Tu Wei-yueh fixed his keen gaze on Kuei
Chang-lin’s face: the face of a man nearing forty, square, with
small eyes that did not quite match, and with a rather vil-
lainous cast to its features, which showed increasing signs of
uneasiness beneath Tu Wei-yueh’s piercing gaze.

Suddenly Tu Wei-yueh laughed, then asked coldly, “Chang-
lin, do you really mean to go on being at daggers drawn with
Chien Pao-sheng?”

Instead of answering, Kuei Chang-lin shook himself, put his
hands on his hips, and glared at Tu Wei-yueh.

“Come now, what chance have you got against a man with his
pull?”

“Huh! Pull? He’s got damn-all pull! He’s nothing more than
a high official’s lap-dog.”

“Exactly, but that’s just where you lose. Your Mr. Wang
Ching-wei’s away in Hongkong.”

Kuei Chang-lin’s face fell, and the aggressive glint in his eye
gave way to a look of fear and uncertainty.

“You needn’t worry, though. There’s only Wang Chin-chen
here, and she’s a good friend of yours. I can tell you quite
frankly that Mr. Wu Sun-fu keeps in touch with friends of
Mr. Wang Ching-wei, so, when you come to think of it, you and
Mr. Wu Sun-fu are in the swim together, as it were. So you
ought to be willing to do your best for Mr. Wu Sun-fu in factory
affairs. Am I right?”

“If Mr. Wu Sun-fu knows everything about me, then why
should he have given Yao Chin-feng the sack and promoted
Hsueh Pao-chu? And besides, I’ve done my best for him all
through this trouble, haven’t 1? I’d like to ask him that to his
face and see what he says!”

“Mr. Wu isn’t playing the game,” interposed Wang Chin-chen.
“Mr. Tu, why don’t you have a word with Mr. Wu about it
before you put up the notice?”

She thought she was being very tactful in supporting Kuei
Chang-lin and at the same time hinting at the Tu Wei-yueh’s
influential position, but, to her surprise, Tu Wei-yueh frowned and
snapped at her:

“You can leave Mr. Wu out of it! He’s too busy to bother him-
self about such trifles. I, Tu Wei-yueh, am responsible here.
When I say to him that Yao Chin-feng should be fired and Hsueh
Pao-chu promoted, he just nods his head, and what I say goes.”

“Then you’ve done Yao Chin-feng an injustice on your own
responsibility!” cried Kuei Chang-lin, springing up and shaking
his fist. Wang Chin-chen pulled him back by the hem of his
coat. Tu Wei-yueh threw back his head and laughed as if he
had not seen the ham-like fist being brandished under his nose.
The fist was withdrawn automatically when it came within a
few inches of his face, and a venomous humph was heard. Tu
Wei-yueh had stopped laughing and his face was as calm and
expressionless as ever.

“Pah!” he suddenly spat out. ‘You fool! It’s all too com-
plicated for your thick head! Can’t you imagine how the women
will react when they hear that Hsueh Pao-chu’s been promoted
and Yao Chin-feng discharged? They’ll suspect Hsueh Pao-chu
and support Yao Chin-feng again —”

“But how can they support her when she’s been sacked?”

“Chang-lin, please... why can’t you stop and think before you
speak? Haven't I told you Mr. Wu Sun-fu’ll play fair with every-
body in the long run? It won’t do any good standing here
grumbling: you’d be better employed working on the women. As
for Chien Pao-sheng, I’ll teach him a lesson yet, and in public
too, one of these days. And remember, both of you, that I’m
on your side. I give you my word for it. Understand? Off
you go, then.”

Having dismissed them, Tu Wei-yueh took a piece of paper
and began wording the notice.

The hooter blared its summons from one end of the factory
to the other, and the women streamed into the workshops. The
buzz of voices began to swell in to a tide, but this time the tide
was to flow through a channel which had been engineered by
Tu Wei-yueh.

When he left the factory Wu Sun-fu had gone straight to the
Bankers’ Club. Except for Sundays, he usually lunched here,
for here he could meet his friends in a cheerful atmosphere, and
sit around chatting for an hour or so. But today, as he stepped
into the well appointed dining-room, he was struck by the
absence of the usual warm and cheerful atmosphere. He was
not met by the smiles and jovial greetings of his cronies. The
few people there were all strangers, and their talk, mingled with
the clatter of knives and forks, was either about the war or about
dancing girls and dog racing. They seemed to have nothing bet-
ter to talk about; they were just trying to kill time while they
ate. At a table under the windows sat three middle-aged men
whose chubby faces, beaming with complacency, suggested that
they had lived a comfortable and idle life in the country as rich
landlords and usurers. They sat with their heads together con-
ferring in whispers. Wu Sun-fu chose a place facing them,
two or three tables away.

Outside the windows everything was still obscured by the
thick, misty drizzle, so that one might have imagined that the
prosperous industrial city of Shanghai had disappeared from the
face of the earth, leaving only this dining-room with its half-
a-dozen young bloods talking listlessly about dancing girls and
greyhound racing, its three feudal landlords, and its industrialist,
Wu Sun-fu, worrying about his battles on the three fronts.

Wu Sun-fu sighed dejectedly and ordered a brandy. When it
came, he sipped at it nervously.

There was no denying it: he was between three fires; and there
was no denying that he had been fighting back as hard as he
could. At a moment like this, when his fate was still in the
balance, it was futile for him to start thinking about how he
should advance if he won, and he was too distraught to plan a
withdrawal or counter-attack in case he was defeated. In any
ease, he did not know where to start in his planning for the
future, since he had no idea what the extent of his losses would
be. All he could do for the moment was to drown his sorrows
in his brandy. He felt rather like a prisoner waiting in the
condemned cell.

The brandy picked him up somewhat —or at least, it restored
his usual quickness of hearing. One of the three whisperers

spoke a little more distinctly than the other two, and Wu Sun-
fu clearly overheard a snatch of conversation which made him
sit up.

“Now that we’ve gone as far as this, we must either go the
whole hog or else drop it altogether. I’m in favour of putting
up a fight, myself. All this talk about a victory by the Central
Army is just a rumour put about by the bulls. You know that
fellow Chao? Well, he’s one of the big bulls and he’s rigging
the market. Though I don’t believe he’s so keen on pushing up
the prices just now that we need worry about him.”

Wu Sun-fu could see the speaker in profile—a long, narrow
face with a wispy, drooping moustache. His companions were
listening in silence, one of them resting his chin on his upturned
palm and holding a coffee-cup in the other hand as he gazed
thoughtfully into space. After a brief pause they both began
speaking at the same time, but their voices were so low and in-
distinct that it was only from their expressions that one could
tell that they were arguing with the man with the moustache.
They were obviously speculators in government bonds, and
bears at that.

Wu Sun-fu glanced at his watch and saw that it was already
ten minutes to one. Newcomers arrived from time to time, but
curiously enough there was not a single familiar face among
them. He fiddled abstractedly with his knife and fork as he
turned over in his mind the remarks the man with the moustache
had just made. Could it be that they represented the trend of
thought among the bears as a whole? It was hard for him to
say. But obviously the market was still in a state of flux, and a
life and death struggle was going on there. Perhaps this was
the reason why he had not met a single acquaintance here to-
day. Anyway, there was no point in hanging about here. He
pushed aside his plate and was just going to get up, when he
saw two familiar faces: Han Meng-hsiang and Li Yu-ting, the
former being a stockbroker and a close friend of Chao Po-tao.

Seeing Wu Sun-fu there, Han Meng-hsiang smiled to him and
came across.

“Both sides are holding out as long as they can,” he whispered.
“Chao Po-tao’s furious.”

“What! — Furious, is he?”

Wu Sun-fu was taken off his guard for a moment, but quickly
recovered his composure, so that his question sounded off-handed
enough not to rouse the other's suspicions.

“Chao Po-tao doesn’t go for small fry,” said Han Meng-hsiang
quietly, smiling and glancing round at Li Yu-ting. “He goes
whaling. It’s all or nothing with him! Wait until the after-
noon session opens at two, and then you’ll see!”

Just then, one of the three men at the other table, a pale,
corpulent little man, bobbed up and called across, “Mr. Han
Meng-hsiang!” His two companions were still engrossed in
their téte-a4-téte. Han Meng-hsiang nodded to Wu Sun-fu and
went across to join the others. An animated conversation
ensued — doubtless about the day’s events on the Stock Ex-
change.

Wu Sun-fu now invited Li Yu-ting to join him for lunch, and
they chatted for a while about this and that. Wu Sun-fu, his
face flushed with the wine, suddenly brought up the subject of
Chang Su-su.

“My wife was telling me the other day that you and Su-su
have had a bit of a tiff.”

“Oh, we’ve never been serious about it~—not enough to have
a tiff, anyway!”

Li Yu-ting sounded rather embarrassed as he replied. Re-
membering the way Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-sheng had ragged
him, he felt more uncomfortable still, But Wu Sun-fu did not
seem to notice his embarrassment. Gulping down a large
mouthful of lemonade, he continued cheerfully:

“You know, Su-su’s lively and independent like her father
and clever and sharp like her mother. I think she’d be too much
of a handful for you, Yu-ting!”

Li Yu-ting’s only reply was a wry smile as he bent his head
to tackle the leg of chicken before him.

A boisterous laugh came from Han Meng-hsiang at the other
table, followed by a noisy, heated argument between the four of
them. A deep voice boomed above the babel: “All you’ve got
to do, Yun-ching, is to chase up your tenants for a bit more
rent, and there you are!”

The man with the moustache shook his long head and said
mournfully, “No, that’s no good. It’s been a bad year, and every-

where the peasants are rioting and refusing to pay their rents.”

At this the babel of voices broke loose again.

Wu Sun-fu knit his brows in a frown, covered his wineglass
with his hand, and asked, “What’s the news? Anything special?”

“T hear there’s a big scheme afoot,” Li Yu-ting replied casually,
laying down his knife and fork and wiping his mouth with
his napkin. “And it happens to concern you, too.”

“A big scheme that concerns me?” returned Wu Sun-fu in an
equally casual tone, putting on a light-hearted smile. “Well, I
haven't heard anything about it!”

He assumed Li Yu-ting was referring to the trust company.
After all, it was no secret, really, though he was a little irked
at the speed with which the news had spread. As it turned out,
however, he was in for a shock.

“It’s not what you’re thinking, though,” Li Yu-ting went on.
“you're not one of those who are launching the scheme: you're
one of the people it’s aimed at. That’s what I meant when I
said it concerns you. I should have thought you would have
heard about it already.”

“Oh... no, I haven’t heard a thing. Honestly I haven't.”

“Ti’s too early yet to be able to say whether they’re going
to go through with it, but I have heard that they’re quite set
on the idea. Well, to cut a long story short, some finance capi-
talists are planning to take over certain industries. They’re
taking their cue from American financiers who have got control
of industry.”

Wu Sun-fu half closed his eyes and gently shook his head.

“you don’t think they can do it?” pursued Li Yu-ting. “Don’t
forget the Shanghai bankers made a total profit of two hundred
million dollars last year, and now, of course, they’re looking for
something to invest all this surplus capital in.”

“The obvious thing to do with it,” retorted Wu Sun-fu con-
temptuously, “is to put it into the government stock market, or
else real estate or building. They wouldn’t dream of looking
beyond investments like that.”

His face was flushed with drinking, and his self-confidence
was probably inspired by the fact that he was becoming slightly
tipsy. His companion, who had also been imbibing freely, was
waxing eloquent, and was not to be gainsaid.

“I’m afraid you’re underestimating them, Sun-fu. They’re
really set on this scheme, even though they haven’t got the
foundations solidly laid so far. You can’t afford to ignore them,
though, even at this early stage—especially when a number
of American financiers are backing their scheme. I hear the
first thing they’re planning to do is to get the government to
issue a vast number of industrial bonds, so that they can buy
them up and gradually gain control over industry on the pre-
tence of aiding it. But this'll be only the beginning of the control
of industrial capital by financial capital: the possibilities of a fur-
ther—”

“But the government won’t issue enough bonds to meet their
military expenses, let alone start financing industrial construc-
tion!”

“That’s true at the moment, but then the war’s still on. What
these people are hoping is that the war will end with a govern-
ment victory and that the whole country will become united.
And of course their American friends hope so, too. So far as
I can see, their wishes look like coming true; and I bet when that
happens you won’t be saying that their scheme is just a lot of
wishful thinking! How can you possibly say that they can’t put
it through, considering all the American experience and dollars
they’ll have behind them? Listen, Sun-fu, you know the way
it goes in. Western countries: financial capital’s swallowing in-
dustrial capital all the time. Well, just think. how much worse
it will be in China, where industry’s still in its infancy—and not
a very flourishing one at that— and where the American dollar
is always looking for a chance to get a foothold—”

“But that’d be throwing our national industry to the wolves!”
Wu Sun-fu suddenly interrupted through clenched teeth. His
tipsiness had worn off and left his face pale and his eyes blood-
shot. .He could no longer even muster up his usual cool, con-
temptuous smile. His sudden indignation came as a surprise to
Li Yu-ting, who promptly fell silent for a while, then, as if to
ease the tense atmosphere, muttered to himself:

“On the other hand, the scheme may fizzle out. After all,
America still doesn’t have all her own way in the world, especial-
ly in the East, where she has two serious rivals.”

“pngland and Japan, do you mean?” asked Wu Sun-fu, gazing
blankly out of the window. Then, without conviction: “Yes,
well, perhaps when the war’s over things may not pan out just
as the financiers are hoping they will.”

His brain was in a whirl just at the moment. His righteous
indignation at the fate of China’s national industries was be-
ginning to cool down and make way for apprehension about his
own personal interests; and this apprehension became more and
more insistent, until he could think of nothing else. Li Yu-ting
was right, of course, when he said China’s industry was based
on a very shaky foundation. As for the weakest going to the
wall, well, that’s just what was happening among the Chinese
industrialists themselves: wasn’t he himself scheming to swallow
up Chu Yin-chiu, who was weaker than he was? And now he
himself was in danger of being swallowed up—just when he was
already in the middle of three decisive battles, too. The more
he thought about it all, the worse he felt.

His despondent reverie was suddenly interrupted by someone
calling his name. He looked up to see Han Meng-hsiang, look-
ing very pleased with himself, raise his hand to bid him good-
bye, then hurry out with his three companions in tow, the one
with the moustache unhurriedly bringing up the rear. ,

“Off to the Exchange, I suppose,” said Li Yu-ting in low, rather
mournful tones as he gazed at their retreating figures and then
glanced back at his companion. “Phe Exchange today is just
like a battlefield.”

The waiter served their coffee. Wu Sun-fu took a sip at his,
then put down his cup and asked Li Yu-ting, “It seems, then, that
the people behind this scheme are American financiers; but who
have they got helping them here? Whoever they are, they’re
letting the wolf into the fold!”

“They say Shang Chung-li and Chao Po-tao are among them,”
said Li Yu-ting off-handedly, engrossed in his coffee. Wu Sun-
fu’s expression changed in a flash to one of dismay: so it was
Chao Po-tao again, eh? I’ve been taken in properly this time,
he thought, and this “bull company” idea is just a trap. He
snorted, but made no comment. His mortification, however,
quickly evaporated and gave way to anger and thoughts of re-
venge; now that he had accepted defeat as inevitable, he became

strangely calm and his courage began to return. All he wanted
now was to ascertain the full extent of his losses, so that he
could begin to salvage what he could from the wreckage and
plan a counter-attack at the first opportunity.

After he had taken his leave of Li Yu-ting, Wu Sun-fu drove
straight home. As he sat in the car, the thoughts raced through
his head like the wheels beneath him as once again he carefully
turned over in his mind all that he had just learnt from Li Yu-
ting. He tried to comfort himself with the thought that perhaps,
after all, the scheme might not prove practicable —it might not
exist, even. It was probably just a wild idea of Chao Po-tao’s,
reinforced by American bourgeois megalomania. Hadn’t some
European scholar once said that after the Great War this
megalomania of the American bourgeoisie had developed out all
proportion? And hadn’t the world depression also struck the
United States?. .. But then they’d had Dawes and Young. Yes,
the United States might be preparing a second Dawes Plan for
China. As soon as the war was over and the country had a
unified government, it would fall pat into the hands of the
Yankee, and a second Dawes Plan would come into operation.
Ah, but what about the other two Powers in the East?—If this
happened, their interests would be threatened and the three of
them might come to blows! The thought brought a sardonic
smile to Wu Sun-fu’s lips. It was at this point in his musings
that the car turned in at his front gate and swished up the drive.

Another shower greeted him as he got out of the car. The
overcast sky shrouded the garden in a twilight gloom, and in-
doors all the lights were on. In the big drawing-room he found
his wife, his sister Huei-fang and Tu Hsin-to. He stopped for
a few words with them, then hurried off to his study. He did
not relish the idea of having people see him when he was upset;
and besides, he had a pile of correspondence to deal with.

He got a number of routine business letters out of the way
first, then turned his attention to a long letter from a friend in
Wusih who owned a cotton mill and was anxious that Wu Sun-
fu should take up some of the new shares he was issuing to
enable him to increase the number of spindles in his factory. The
request had come just at the wrong moment, and as he scribbled
a reply, his ili-humour seemed to find expression in his wording,

so that when he went through it afterwards he was amazed
that he could have written such a peevishly worded letter. He
tore it up and, hardly feeling in a mood to rewrite it, went back
into the drawing-room.

When he walked in, Lin Pei-shan was playing a dismal tune
on the piano, while the yellow lamp-light, as dismal as the music,
fell on her slender figure, which was sheathed in deep-blue
silk. Wu Sun-fu frowned and was just going to say something,
when he heard a sigh. His frown deepened as he looked round
to see his wife sitting there, her eyes red with weeping and her
cheeks still wet. Her sigh was echoed by a lugubrious utterance
from Tu Hsin-to.

“Life is like the morning dew! And that’s just the mood that
this tune expresses. It’s just the right tune to play on such a
dark, rainy day as this, in this dreamy lamp-light.”

Wu Sun-fu’s face darkened at these ominous words, and an
overpowering sense of foreboding clutched at his heart like a
steel claw. He was about to give vent to his fury, when the
butler, Kao Sheng, came in with a message that made his heart
miss a beat.

“You’re wanted on the phone, sir. It’s the factory.” Wu Sun-
fu spun round and hurried out. So they’d rung through at last!
But which was it to be—success or disaster? His hand trembled
in spite of himself as he picked up the receiver. A brief pause,
then his face lit up with relief as he answered in a clear, cheer-
ful voice:

“Well done!... All right, if you insist: two weeks’ double pay
for Kuei Chang-lin. See you at nine in the morning.”

The trouble at the factory was ended, and victory was his.
There was no need for him to worry about the “home front”
any longer.

He replaced the receiver with a smile. By now the shower had
passed, and a shaft of golden sunlight streamed in through the
window from the west. Outside the window, the trees in the
garden were a vivid green and seemed to be dripping rhythmi-
cally. Light of heart and step, Wu Sun-fu went along a veranda
and out into the rain-washed garden. Strolling along the drive,
he felt that the air had never been so fresh before. As he ap-
proached the front door, he heard the furious blare of a horn,

and a car raced up the drive. It had hardly stopped before
the house, when Tu Chu-chai scrambled out. It was not like
him to be in such a tearing hurry!

“What’s happened, Chu-chai?” asked Wu Sun-fu as he hurried
across to the car in a torment of suspense. But he did not need
to wait for a reply to know that they had won, for Tu Chu-
chai’s goat-like face, care-worn as it was, beamed with undis-
guised satisfaction. As they went up the steps together, Tu Chu-
chai told him in a triumphant whisper:

“All the bears made a last-minute rush to cover in the after-
noon session; the rise was terrific and almost reached the limit
and caused trading to close. If we’d bought in two or three
million more, we could easily have got rid of them today. Pity
we were too cautious! Our present position—”

“Skip it,” smiled Wu Sun-fu, “we’ve done well enough for a
start pulling this little lot off. There’s always time to go into
it in a big way later on.”

The setting sun shone full on his face, lighting it up with a rosy
glow. The dismal look which had been lurking in his eyes all
day had quite vanished. The siege was broken, and two of his
three big battles were won. As for the great scheme—the great
plot, if you will—which Li Yu-ting had told him about, it held
no terrors for him now as he basked in the glow of his victories.
Vill

T HE last-minute rise in government-issue quotations had taken
many indiscriminate speculators by surprise, and they had crashed
badly. Among their number were the three men Wu Sun-fu had
seen that day when he dined at the Bankers’ Club; the worst hit
of the three was Feng Yun-ching, the fiftyish man with the long
face and the drooping moustache.

Until six months ago, this Feng Yun-ching had enjoyed an idle,
comfortable life down in the country. Back in the time of the
Manchu dynasty he had passed the preliminary official ex-
aminations, but had got no further and so had not qualified to
take his place among the “gentry,” who had charge of local af-
fairs. Failing in this ambition, hc had diverted his energies into
other channels—exploitation of the peasantry as a usurious
money-lender. As it turned out, this second course proved
equally rewarding, for it yielded him a fair amount of property.
When he made his “countryside loans” to local peasants, he did
not insist on cash repayments, nor did he press for prompt cash
settlements of his loans, which at the end of six months had
earned him interest equal to the original loan: no, what he was
interested in was to let a loan grow until he could foreclose the
peasant of his mortgaged land. He had a genius for making a
five- or ten-dollar Joan and letting it bring him in an acre or two
of land at the end of two years. This was, of course, quite a
common method among the landlords up country, but Feng Yun-
ching, “The Smiling Tiger,” distinguished himself by his skill
in giving his debtors just enough rope to hang themselves with.
Like the spidet that spins its web and waits patiently for its
prey, he cast his nets with care, and when his victim found him-
self with a debt he could not repay—it might be as little as a
dollar—he would invariably end up by forfeiting his land to

Feng Yun-ching. Then, when his land was gone, he would be
forced to become a mere tenant working on his land, and as
such he would be no more than a slave, a beast of burden. Five
years ago, he had already amassed about four hundred acres
by this means, using every shift of deceit and guile, just half an
acre or an acre at a time; and every acre wet with the sweat
and tears of the dispossessed peasant. And so it was that, from
the wrecked lives of hundreds of peasants, Feng Yun-ching had
been able to win himself a life of luxury and dissipation. Be-
fore long, he contrived to worm his way into local political cir-
cles, where his extended influence enabled him to cast his net
of usury wider and exert greater pressure on his peasant victims,
so that, within the short space of two years, he managed to add
two hundred acres or so to his holdings. By this time, however,
his newly acquired concubine, Chiu, on whom he doted, began
to spend his money for him with remarkable liberality. Nor
was this all: the possession of a vivacious young concubine
was a drain on his energy. The effect of all this made itself felt
when rioting broke out among the peasantry and swarms of
bandits made their appearance: Feng Yun-ching’s accustomed
boldness and imperturbability deserted him, and he collected up
all his ready cash and removed himself and his family to Shang-
hai—partly for fear of the peasants and bandits, and partly be-
cause his concubine Chiu wished it.

Now, though a respectable citizen of Shanghai, he did not
like the idea of living on his uninvested capital. He had well
over five hundred acres of land, it is true, and a certain amount
of rent was forthcoming, but in these troubled times there was
no guarantee that he would be able to collect his usual sixty per
cent of his tenants’ farm produce as he had in days past. He
had brought some eighty thousand dollars in cash with him, but
this was not enough to qualify him as a money-lender in a city
like Shanghai. If he put the money in a bank, the rate of in-
terest was too low to meet his current household expenses, which
came to nearly a thousand dollars a month if one included his
concubine’s opium money. It was a problem requiring very care-
ful thought. Fortunately, the government had issued large
quantities of different kinds of bonds, and the armed clashes
between the warlords, which dragged on from year to year, had

kept the stock market in a state of flux and provided a con-
stant excellent opportunity for speculation. Feng Yun-ching,
with his eighty thousand dollars, had therefore plunged into the
stock market. His luck had held for six months running, his
monthly profit being a good two and a half per cent. He had
almost begun to call himself a “stock expert.” And now he had
suffered this shattering blow. He could hardly believe it.

When he came to reckon up his losses, he found he had really
come to grief: his deposit of fifty thousand dollars in the Ex-
change was all gone, and he owed thirty thousand more, which
he would have to pay within three days—his broker, Han Meng-
hsiang, had been in once already to press for payment. Ever
since he had got up at half past eleven that morning, Feng Yun-
ching had been hard at work with an abacus. It was now two
o’clock in the afternoon and he had not had a bite of food; and
still he could not find a way to make ends meet. What grieved
him most was that he could see no way of winning back his
money.

Sunlight was streaming through the bamboo blinds and throw-
ing a criss-cross pattern of light and shade over part of the room.
At the slightest breeze the blinds gently swayed, and this filigree
of shadows rippled over the chairs and tables in a black and
white fantasy. Sitting at a square mahogany table under the
window, Feng Yun-ching was turning the pages of an account-
book with his right hand and holding a cigarette in his left. As
the shadows danced across the pages of his book, the columns
of figures seemed to dance with them, much to his annoyance.
Bringing his palm down on the book with an impatient thwack,
he left his seat and paced through into the rear part of the
house, where he lay down on a mahogany couch and closed his
eyes with a sigh. Until yesterday he had been a rich man: to-
day he was not only penniless, but tens of thousands of dollars
in debt! Was it his own fault? No; that was something he
would never admit! “It’s just my bad luck,” he told himself with
another sigh. Yet why should his luck, which had stood him
in good stead these twenty years and more, suddenly desert him
now? He was knitting his brows in search of an answer, when
suddenly something fell with a heavy thud on the floor above
him, and he sat up with a nervous start. Then the electric bell

in the servants’ quarters began ringing, and continued to ring
for fully three minutes. It was his concubine ringing for the
maid after waking up—the night before, she had not come home
until dawn. This was now her usual custom, and Feng Yun-
ching had long resigned himself to it; but today when he had
just found himself bankrupt, it annoyed him, and it suddenly
occurred to him that there must be some connection between his
bad luck and her bad behaviour: who had ever heard of a be-
trayed husband being lucky?

Feng Yun-ching stood up and started towards the door, but
changed his mind and turned round again, his straggly moustache
twitching agitatedly. He had half a mind to go up and tell her
to her face to behave herself, but he thought better of it and
stayed where he was: he remembered in time that concubines
of her category could be dangerous when roused. He swallowed
his anger and turned his eyes vacantly on the Marxims for Keep-
ing Order in a Family inscribed on a scroll hanging on the
wall above the couch. He stared at it glumly, and soon became
lost in thought.

Presently there came the click of high-heeled shoes as foot-
steps approached and suddenly stopped outside the door. The
door was flung open, and a girl of about eighteen fluttered into
the room. Her face was a shade too long and narrow, but this
shortcoming was amply compensated by an attractive mouth,
a shapely chin—neither too pointed nor too round—and long,
wavy hair hanging loosely over her shoulders. Her dress was
of light-blue patterned silk with a lining of deep yellow and long
side-slits which flared open as she walked, to give a glimpse of
her smooth, shapely thighs—a striking contrast to the high, stiff
collar which hid her neck. When she saw Feng Yun-ching star-
ing abstractedly at the scroll she paused uncertainly in the door-
way a moment, then giggled and went over to him, her hips
swaying as she walked.

“Daddy,” she cooed, “I’m going out shopping—”

Feng Yun-ching turned round and looked at her wide-eyed.

“Just a few little things,” she said, twisting her hips and look-
ing down at the floor. “A hundred dollars should be enough, I
think. I must go straight away.”

Suddenly she flitted across the room, leant over the square
table, and switched on the electric fan. She turned her back
to the wind, and wheedled, “Why don’t you use the electric fan,
Daddy? Look how you're perspiring! Come on, it’s nice and
cool here... . Just a hundred dollars, Daddy!”

Feng Yun-ching shook his head regretfully, walked slowly
across to her, looked at her silently for a while, then said with
a note of determination in his voice:

“Mei-ching, you don’t know what a setback I’ve just had in
the stock market. I’m over thirty thousand dollars in debt, and
I can’t pay up. I can’t even settle the small accounts due at
the Dragon-boat Festival. For instance, I’ve got a bill for five
hundred dollars from your dress-maker—”

“But I only had a few dresses made, Daddy.”

“Hm-—but now you’re asking for another hundred dollars:
what do you need this time? Mei-ching, you spend more money
than I do!”

“ven so, I spend much less than Chiu does!” Mei-ching re-
torted, pouting out her lips. With a twist of her waist she swung
herself on to a sofa and looked up into her father’s face, which
was creased with embarrassment and worry. Reading his mind,
she pursued deliberately, “If she can spend as much as she likes,
why shouldn’t everybody else? I don’t see why I should have
to give in to her!”

“Don’t worry, Mei-ching!” Feng Yun-ching urged, forcing a
placating smile to his lips. “Just give me a day or two, and
then I can let you have it. How’s that?”

His daughter did not reply, but sat twisting her handkerchief
and looking round at the pictures on the walls. On one wall
was a combined display of Chinese and Western art: Chang
Ta-chien’s tiger in the centre, supported on each side by two
Western landscape etchings in colour representing the four
seasons, their gilt frames glinting in the sunlight which flickered
on them through the bamboo blinds. As Feng Yun-ching fol-
lowed his daughter’s eyes to the pictures, he began turning over
in his mind how he could get rid of her. Suddenly he remem-
bered something in connection with these etchings, which he had
received as a house-warming present from one of his concubine’s
“sworn sisters.” She had quite a few “sworn sisters,” but this

one, the sender of the present, was no ordinary girl: she was
concubine to a man with considerable influence in the underworld,
the man on whom Feng Yun-ching depended for his personal
safety while he was in Shanghai. In three days’ time the Dragon-
boat Festival would be upon them, and he had quite forgotten
until now that he would have to send his protector an expensive
present to show his gratitude.

As he suddenly remembered that he had this important duty
to perform, Feng Yun-ching decided that he had no money at
all to spare for his daughter.

“Mei-ching, my dear, just wait until the festival's over to do
your shopping. You see, I still have to send presents to several
important people. Your poor father’s really hard up just now.
... Just my luck to go and lose a packet in the stock market.
Mei-ching, you’re my only daughter: do you think I'd refuse
you anything if I could help it—?”

Feng Yun-ching could not go on, for a lump was rising in his
throat. He looked up at the ceiling, and nervously stroked his
straggly moustache.

For a few moments neither of them spoke, and the silence was
broken only by the sound of the concubine clearing her throat
in the room above. Feng Yun-ching was worrying about his
debts, while the despondent Mei-ching was despairing of ever
getting her hundred dollars. It looked as if the pleasant pro-
gramme she had worked out for the festival would have to be
cancelled, so how was she going to spend the three days’ holiday?
She could not just stay at home and read “eternal triangle”
stories. Besides, she had already made a date with a friend, so
how could she back out now? In her mind’s-eye she could
already see her boy friend’s disappointed and suspicious looks if
she called off the holiday programme.

Three successive rings on the bell at the gate startled Feng
Yun-ching from his reverie. He looked out of the window and
saw his rickshaw boy Ah-shun opening the gate and ushering in
a round-faced middle-aged man in a round, black alpaca cap.
“Oh, here’s Ho Shen-an!” he gasped, and rose to go out to meet
him; but his visitor was too quick for him, and almost im-
mediately appeared in the doorway and called his name, at the
same time shaking his clasped hands together, with his walking-

stick dangling between them. Doing her best to keep a straight
face, Mei-ching made an especially low bow in order to hide
her amusement, for every time she saw him in his little round
cap, bobbing up and down with his stick held in front of him,
she just couldn’t help laughing.

“Mei-ching, run and tell the maid to serve tea,” said Feng
Yun-ching, then offered Ho Shen-an a seat on the couch. As
Mei-ching tripped lightly out of the room, Ho Shen-an gazed
after her. With a thoughtful twitch of his eyebrows, he turned
seriously to Feng Yun-ching:

“I’m not trying to flatter you, Yun-ching, but you’ve got a
wonderful daughter there. You’re a lucky man.”

Feng Yun-ching took it as an ordinary compliment and smiled
woodenly, wondering how his friend who had also been hit by
the recent stock exchange fluctuations could be so cheerful.
Glancing at his own reflection in the long mirror standing in the
corner of the room, he was surprised to find that he had aged
overnight by at least ten years. A sigh broke from his lips, and
he said in a low voice:

“Han Meng-hsiang came yesterday for the money I owe the
Exchange, but I just hadn’t got it to give him. Though I must
say this for Han Meng-hsiang: he always treats his friends
decently. Don’t you remember how he advised us to cover
without delay the other day when we were lunching at the club?
If we’d taken any notice of him, we wouldn’t have come a crop-
per like this. Ah! You made a bit of a blunder this time, Shen-
an: your friends in the North— the Peiyang clique— have been
leading you up the garden path—”

“And serve us right, too!” interrupted Ho Shen-an, with a
rueful grin. “They set the trap for us, and we walked right into
it. And as for Han Meng-hsiang being a good friend to us—hah!
He’s only Chao Po-tao’s mouthpiece. They set out to trap us
right from the start. It was just a big conspiracy. And now
I’ve found out all about it.”

He threw the stub of his cigarette viciously into a spittoon,
then picked up a cup of tea from the table and took a sip at it.

“What do you mean, conspiracy? You're not trying to tell
me they rigged a victory at the front as part of their trap?”

“Why not? So it wasn’t our bad luck that did for us: it was
our honesty!”

Feng Yun-ching’s eyes rolled in amazement, while his straggly
moustache twitched, and he broke out into a cold sweat all over.
There was no reason to disbelieve what he had just been told.
He had become so used to setting traps for peasants all these
years that it came as rather a shock to him to find he had walked
into a snare himself. He stroked his moustache agitatedly as
he slowly pulled himself together, then grumbled miserably:

“It means ... it means I’ve been slaving all these years just
to put money in their pockets! Shen-an, you don’t know how
hard it’s been for me to make what little money I had. You’d
be surprised how much breath you have to waste over a mere
half acre of land. They’re a woolly-minded lot, these country
people: they want loans, but they don’t want to give up their
farms! Usually, I had to go to a lot of trouble with them—invite
them to a tea-house, and reason patiently with them, until I
could finally make them realize that I was not robbing them of
their farms, but merely trying to get back the interests on my
loans—you know yourself, Shen-an, how reasonable I am. For
example, whenever I went down to the village to collect my rents,
I never took any strong-arm men with me to beat up my
tenants: I always used the method of gentle persuasion—though,
of course, I never came away with a halfpenny less than I went
for! And that’s how I managed to get together a few hundred
acres of land. I can tell you, it wasn’t so easy for me to make
money as it was for you when you were a county magistrate.
Yours was a soft job—you just cooked the land-tax accounts
and reserved yourself a percentage of the opium pool, so that
what you made in a month would have taken me a year to
scrape together. ...”

Feng Yun-ching paused and drew violently at his cigarette.
He was about to go on when Ho Shen-an stopped him:

“Come now, that’s all past history. What’s the point in going
over it all again?—-But tell me, though: are you going to have
another go at the stock business?”

“Another go? Well, to tell you the truth, I’m a bit scared now.
I was going over the ups and downs of the stock market this
morning, and I decided the stock business is a bit too tricky.

Now that you've told me about the crafty dodges they get up to,
I’m finished with it for good. Besides, after a crash like that,
I’ve got nothing left to start with—but what about you,
Shen-an?”

“Every penny of ten years’ savings down the drain! Yesterday
I sold a few curios at a tea-house gathering just to get a thousand
dollars or so to tide me over the festival. But I’m sure you're
better off: you’ve got plenty of land, and the rent alone must
be quite a—”

Ho Shen-an broke off as Feng Yun-ching sprang to his feet and
threw himself down on the couch again. All the colour had
drained from his face, his eyes were bloodshot and staring, and
the corners of his mouth twitched uncontrollably. Ho Shen-an
gaped at him in surprise and scratched his head. After a mo-
ment, Feng Yun-ching raised his hand tensely and slammed it
down on a low table beside him.

“Rent?” he spat out between clenched teeth. “Who dares
go down into the villages for rent these days? If I could collect
my rents, d’you think I’d have left a perfectly good country
house of that size to come and live in this hole in Shanghai
and stay here worrying myself to death about robbery and
kidnapping day in, day out?”

He slumped down on the couch and closed his eyes, panting
hard.

“No, it’s none too peaceful down in the country, I know,” Ho
Shen-an said slowly after a moment’s pause. “But, Yun-ching,
why should you let those damned tenants of yours get away with
it? What’s to stop you taking a few strong-arm men down to
persuade them?”

As he spoke, he toyed with his alpaca cap, gazing at it, and
blowing at it between phrases. Finally, he fished out a handker-
chief and flicked at specks of dust on it, a shadow of a smile on
his smooth, oily round face.

Sprawled on his back, Feng Yun-ching could only sigh in
answer to this question. He was, of course, well acquainted
with the method of collecting rents with an armed escort, but
he was also quite aware that the peasants were not like they
used to be. If you went with a mere handful of men, they were
no use at all; if you took a lot, they ate their heads off, and even

if they did manage to get you something, it was never enough
to pay their wages and expenses: no, the game was not worth
the candle. That was a lesson Feng Yun-ching had already
learned once to his cost. The “Smiling Tiger,” shrewd old rogue
that he was, had since preferred to let his rents fall in arrears
for a year, and count on the chance that the coming year would
be peaceful enough for him to go down to the village and use
his usual old tricks to make his tenants fork out every cent of
the compound interest.

Ho Shen-an lit another cigarette, puffed at it, and started on a
new topic:

“Well, Yun-ching, let’s consider how we’re going to recover
our losses.”

“Recover what losses?” Feng Yun-ching asked nervously, sit-
ting up with a start. He was still thinking about his property in
the country and his tenants. He seemed to see the grievances of
his tenants issuing like vapours from the murky depths of their
huddled, straw-thatched huts—grievances which dated back
thousands of years, grievances against oppression and exploita-
tion, now crying out for revenge and redress, grievances which
were about to erupt like a volcano and burn and destroy their
fetters and shackles. Yet Ho Shen-an knew nothing of this, and
answered with a smile:

“He who has broken his arm three times makes a good sur-
geon.’ Go back to where you lost and recoup your losses!”

“Oh, I see, you’re still talking about the stock business.”

“Of course I am. Don’t tell me you’ve lost heart.”

“I haven’t exactly lost heart: I’ve just got cold feet,” Feng
Yun-ching answered with another sigh, trying hard to keep back
his tears. “The way they set that trap and let us walk right
into it!”

Ho Shen-an burst out laughing. He picked up his walking-
stick, pointed it at Feng Yun-ching, described an arc in the air
with it, then thumped it against the floor as he boomed:

“Come, come, old man! I can quite understand that you’re
a bit shaken up after the crash, but don’t you see?—-The mere
fact that people can set traps and get away with it shows that
success is not a matter of luck: it depends on your method of

doing business. And that’s why I say we've got a fair chance
of recouping our losses—”

“Shen-an—”

“Don’t interrupt. Now, listen! It was Chao Po-tao and his
friends who set this trap. They’re experts at that sort of game
and we obviously don’t stand a chance against them. Now if
only we can do a little snooping and get hold of their secret, we
can recover our losses easily!”

As Ho Shen-an made this pronouncement, he beamed compla-
cently and wagged his head. He suddenly slapped his thighs
and stood up, then planted himself before Feng Yun-ching with
narrowed eyes, and was about to come out with something im-
portant, when Feng Yun-ching knit his brows and said:

“T don’t see how you think you're going to go about the snoop-
ing, though. Chao Po-tao’s a wily old fox—”

“But he’s like Prince Huei of Liang: ‘I have one weakness:
I like a pretty face.’ With a woman as a decoy we can catch
Chao Po-tao just like that!”

We said this in an undertone, bending forward with his lips
to Feng Yun-ching’s ear, then exploded with laughter.

Feng Yun-ching stared at him wide-eyed. He himself. still
wore a frown, but a faint blush suffused his pale face. He
suspected that his friend was pulling his leg, for even he must
have heard about the way Feng Yun-ching’s concubine did not
get home from her nightly jaunts until the next morning. To
cover his embarrassment, he pretended not to notice the sus-
pected insinuation, and half-heartedly tried to steer the con-
versation away.

“an excellent idea!” he said, clucking his tongue in admira-
tion. “That’s what ten years’ experience on the stormy seas
of officialdom does for you! I hope when you've pulled it off
you'll let me have a finger in the pie, Shen-an.”

“I'm afraid you've missed a point,” replied Ho Shen-an, looking
serious. “This is a job for you. I can only advise you how to go
about it.”

His voice had fallen to an almost inaudible whisper, yet it
thundered in Feng Yun-ching’s ears. His face fell, and his heart
beat wildly, though whether from delight or anger—or was it
perhaps fear?—he could not tell. Being quite at a loss how to

reply, he could only stare blankly at Ho Shen-an’s oily, smiling
round face. Ho Shen-an shook his head, then opened his mouth
and let the tip of his yellow-furred tongue flicker out and in
again.

“People admire Chao Po-tao for his shrewdness,” he resumed
quietly. “They say he can tell a genuine gem from a fake at a
glance, and that he can tell a virgin straight away. He likes
his women brand-new, and so long as he’s the first, he doesn’t
worry particularly what they’re like: they’re all grist to his
mill. He’s got a room in a hotel which he keeps specially for
this purpose, and he’s always prowling around a certain roof-
garden in search of fresh talent. So, you see, it’ll be quite easy
to hook him if only we can—”

“If only we can what?” Feng Yun-ching asked eagerly as he
rose from the couch, his eyes gleaming with interest.

“Tf only we can find a clever, pretty and reliable girl... like
your daughter, say,” replied Ho Shen-an calmly and unhurriedly,
a smile on his lips. He still spoke in an undertone, but enunciated
each word clearly and carefully.

Feng Yun-ching gulped uncomfortably, and his face blanched
as he sat dazedly down on the couch again and stared up into
his friend’s plump face. The latter, however, betrayed no sign
of emotion, but moved closer and went on furtively:

“Tt’s our only way! You’re afraid it won’t work? You needn’t
be afraid of that: I give you my word it'll work!—Yun-ching,
you don’t know how lucky you are to have a daughter like
that... .”

“But, Shen-an!”

“Once you’ve hooked him, you can do what you like with
him afterwards. You can go ahead with your business in the
smooth way or the rough way; the old-fashioned way or the
modern way—take your pick. Don’t worry; you can trust me:
I’m a most reliable adviser. To be frank, Yun-ching, you beat
me hollow when it comes to fleecing peasants, but I’m better than
you at snooping around, and setting a pretty sprat to catch a fat
mackerel!”

Ho Shen-an chuckled and took a sip at his tea, then clasped his
hands behind his back and turned to look up at a photograph
hanging on the wall—a family group with Feng Yun-ching’s
daughter Mei-ching gracefully occupying the centre of the picture.
He stood gazing a long time at the photograph, so as to give
Feng Yun-ching plenty of time to turn his suggestion over in
his mind. As he stood there, the sun went behind the clouds,
leaving the room gloomy. From upstairs came the sound of girl-
ish laughter and somewhere a tap was running, while the lane
outside echoed with the cries of pedlars hawking meat-pies,
dumplings and noodles.

But not a sound came from Feng Yun-ching.

Ho Shen-an turned to look in the long mirror as it stood like
a transparent door in the corner of the room. In it was re-
flected Feng Yun-ching’s face, wary and undecided. Suddenly,
the corners of his mouth twitched and wrinkled up and his
beady eyes shifted from side to side—he seemed to be making
up his mind at last. Ho Shen-an could not help turning round
to look at him. Just at that moment, Feng Yun-ching muttered
to himself:

“Set a trap for him to walk into, eh?”

“That’s right, Yun-ching!” Ho Shen-an hurriedly assured him,
then sat down opposite him. Feng Yun-ching twisted his lips
into an uneasy smile and tried another tack:

“Joking apart, Shen-an, you say it’s the battles at the front
that affect the stock market, but that’s not the whole of it: I
think the big speculators’ manipulations are also an important
factor. They’ve got the money to manoeuvre with. This fellow
Chao Po-tao’s one of them, but how can we get his secrets
out of him? You're a crafty old fox if you can do that, Shen-an!”

Ho Shen-an did not seem to be in any hurry to enlighten him:
he just raised his eyebrows and burst out laughing. He saw
through Feng Yun-ching, who was already becoming interested
in his proposition, though he did not dare admit it to his face.

Realizing his embarrassment, Ho Shen-an smiled to himself,
then stood up and patted Feng Yun-ching on the shoulder.

“Don’t be so modest, old man,” he said. “I’m no cleverer
than you are. Just do as you think fit! But now I must be off.”

*

Feng Yun-ching saw his friend to the gate, then turned back
and lingered a moment in the little yard, staring absently at the

pots of red azaleas and the goldfish tank. Suddenly, he burst
out laughing to himself, but hardly had he stopped laughing,
when a couple of tears rolled down his cheeks. He raised two
fingers and felt his eyes, as if he could not believe they were
actually tears. As he looked at the azaleas through his blurred
eyes, they seemed to be transformed into his daughter’s dimples.
He looked at the goldfish tank: the fish had turned into gold bars.
He heaved a sigh and came to, then hurried back indoors and
slumped on to a sofa.

He puckered his forehead in an effort to sort out in his mind
the various urgent matters requiring his attention, but the same
three things kept going round and round in his head:
that his daughter was pretty; that money was so precious; and
that Chao Po-tao could easily be hooked. All of a sudden, he
flared up, slapped himself on the face, and began reviling himself
through clenched teeth!

“You old cuckold! You’re making yourself ridiculous! Ho
Shen-an’s just making a fool of you! Anyone who’s meddled
with officialdom for long must be lower than a snake’s belly,
and Ho Shen-an’s just that sort. You're a respectable landlord,
and you come from a good family. How could you ever listen to
Ho Shen-an’s nonsense? Are you so weak that you’d sink to
that? No! You must try to do something with your property
in the country!”

After this he felt a bit better and squared his shoulders again,
but another problem kept nagging at his mind: the peasants
were rioting and most probably he was no longer able to call all
those hundreds of acres of good land his own—yet he still had
to pay land-tax on them just the same. He shook his head
ruefully as he stood up and looked round to make sure that he
was still in his own comfortable room: he seemed to be hearing
the distant rumble of explosions coming nearer and nearer,
louder and louder!

He was jolted out of his day-dream by a loud knocking at the
Bate. Startled, he shambled out and peeped through the crack
of the door at the caller outside. When he saw that it was not
Han Meng-hsiang coming again for the money, or anybody else
from the Exchange, the colour returned to his face.

The visitor was Li Chuang-fei, a middle-aged man who dis-
tinguished himself by wearing an up-to-date toothbrush mous-
tache. He was one of Feng Yun-ching’s fellow-speculators in
government bonds and a recently-made acquaintance of his.

Feng Yun-ching bowed his friend into the room, glancing at
him as he did so to see how he looked after the disaster in the
stock market, and was surprised to find a rather elated smile cn
his face, a smile reminiscent of Ho Shen-an’s when he came in.
Feng Yun-ching immediately felt ill at ease. He was afraid this
“revolutionary” ex-magistrate also had some worrying, fantastie
plan up his sleeve, something to throw him into another dilemma.
Aged by the events of the past few days, Feng Yun-ching felt
that his tormented nerves could stand no more worry.

It came as a surprise to him, then, when Li Chuang-fei began
getting his own tale of woe off his chest the moment he sat down:

“It just can’t help being a bit superstitious, Yun-ching: J’m
fated to be unlucky this year. Every single plan I’ve made since
New Year’s Day has fallen through. In March I managed to secure
a position as a county magistrate, but less than a month later the
Communists came and bang went my job. And what could I
do in a month? However hard I’d been on the peasants, I could
never have made enough to cover the money I’d laid out when
I bought the post. How could I? Never mind: at least I got a
glimpse of what the job was like. The next thing I did was even
more disastrous. I paid out every penny of eighteen thousand
dollars for a post as an inspector of taxes. They assured me it
was a cushy job with plenty of pickings, and my superiors sent
about a dozen relatives of theirs to be clerks in my office. I hur-
ried down to my new post in the highest spirits, but I’d only
been settled in two days when the war—damn it!—had to break
out right in my area of all places. The enemy took over my dis-
trict and sent one of their own officials to replace me. If I hadn’t
made my escape there and then, there’s no telling what would
have happened to me! So you see, Yun-ching, it’s no fun at all
being any sort of official these days—”

“But I know you never say die! You've still got a whole army
of secretaries and clerks around you, and your rooms in the hotel
are more like a yamen than anything else.”

Feng Yun-ching forced a smile as he said this, because he
had heard that Li Chuang-fei, the famous “revolutionary magis-
trate,” used his “revolutionary” methods not only in public af-
fairs but also in his financial dealings with friends. Though he
had never benefited from Li Chuang-fei’s kind attentions, Feng
Yun-ching had long been aware of his reputation, and as he
now listened to his outpourings of woe, he was naturally rather
wary.

Li Chuang-fei smiled, looked round furtively, and said in a low
voice:

“To tell you the truth, those secretaries and clerks of mine are
all ‘log-rollers’ for me, and I couldn’t very well get rid of them.
On the other hand, I have to spend a lot on their upkeep, and
that keeps me short. On top of that, I lost quite a lot on the
stock market the other day, as you probably know. And now it’s
nearly quarter-day and I’ve got a lot of accounts to settle—just
guess how much I’m short of still!”

So it was just as Feng Yun-ching had feared! His heart missed
a beat and his face fell. He could not think what to say for a
moment. Li Chuang-fei seemed to read his thoughts, for he
looked glum and said in a more sober tone of voice:

“Don’t misunderstand me, Yun-ching! I know you've lost
quite heavily this time, but surely you’re not going to wash
your hands of it? I have discovered a way of recouping our
losses, and I came specially to discuss it with you. If only we
can get it financed properly, this plan will give great results.”

Far from being inspired by Li Chuang-fei’s optimism, Feng
Yun-ching became all the more uneasy, and the expression on his
face became more troubled than ever. He just stood there
without a word, gazing wide-eyed into space. For a few mo-
ments Li Chuang-fei stood looking at him with a sardonic smile.

“Call yourself ‘the Smiling Tiger’ when you're floored by a
little bit of trouble like this?’ he jeered. “—Though I’m not
surprised, really. You’ve been used to a nice, comfortable Life
as a wealthy landlord, just collecting your rents and interest.
But if you’re going to gamble on the Stock Exchange these days,
you'll find you’re half a million up today and broke tomorrow,
and you don’t like that sort of game, apparently. Well, Yun-
ching, Pll give you a word of advice which will help you to like

it. There’s only one thing you’ve got to be if you're going to
speculate: ruthless! Now, suppose yow’re a bull and you buy
a hundred thousand Disbandment and the settlement leaves you
nothing at all. All right! You go ahead and buy two hundred
thousand more, and so you keep on, snowball-fashion. You'll
notice that’s exactly how the government issues ponds: in the
first half of the year they issue two lots of seventy million, and
in the second half, sure as eggs is eggs, they'll issue four lots —
otherwise, how could they carry on financially?”

“But what’s that got to do with us coming a cropper on the
Exchange?” objected Feng Yun-ching. “Other people—”

He broke off with a sigh, and Li Chuang-fei quickly stepped in
again:

“Ah, but don’t you see, that’s where we come in! Since the
market’s bound to be flooded with more and more money, it’s
going to fluctuate more and more from day to day. The smallest
change in the political situation will immediately affect the
prices, and give the stock-jobber an excellent opportunity of
fishing in troubled waters. Go and ask any old hand at the
game, and he’ll tell you he’s never happier than when the war-
lords start making trouble again. On the other hand, if the
political situation remains stable, and you lose, then you lose
for good, and there’s no chance of going in again tomorrow and
recouping your losses. As it is, you’ve got every opportunity—
any day—of recovering what you’ve lost.”

“Do you mean to tell me you like wars?”

“Not always. When I was an inspector of taxes, I was any-
thing but pleased about it. Now that I’m a stock-jobber, naturally
my likes and dislikes have changed—And I'll tell you another
thing: now, you know we all go in for Disbandment and Dis-
armament? Well, the government makes these two issues under
the pretence of trying to end the civil war once and for all,
whereas, in actual fact, these bonds are only adding fuel to the
flames. It’s like this: as soon as a war breaks out, the peasants
down in the country turn bandits and the Communists become
twice as active, with the result that the rich landlords pack their
bags and flock into Shanghai with their money to get away from
them; then, as ready cash accumulates in Shanghai, so the gov-
ernment issues bonds to absorb it—tens of millions of dollars’

worth at a time. But the money they raise in this way goes to
finance the fighting, and as the fighting gets worse, so does the
unrest among the peasants. Result: more and more rich lJand-
lords flock into Shanghai from the country with their money,
and the government seizes the opportunity to issue more bonds.
And so you get a vicious circle of bonds and bombs. Do you
get the hang of it now, Yun-ching? Civil war may mean disaster
for other businessmen, but stock-jobbers thrive on it. If the
civil war went on for a thousand years, you can bet your bottom
dollar there’d be a thousand years of prosperity for the stock-
jobbing business!”

When he paused, Feng Yun-ching used the spittoon and asked
in a worried voice, “Do you think there’s going to be trouble in
the country for a long time yet, then, Chuang-fei?”

“Oh, come now, old man, you’re not still dreaming that you
can go back to being a happy-go-lucky landlord, are you? I
tell you: in a year or two’s time, you wouldn’t be able to give
your land-deeds away, let alone sell them!”

This reply came as a cold douche to Feng Yun-ching, who
could only gape in consternation at Li Chuang-fei’s plump, im-
pudent face, waiting for him to go on. When he saw that he
had no more to say, and that he was in dead earnest, Feng Yun-
ching suddenly felt a buzzing in his ears, and his head swam.
For several days he had been racking his brains what to do
about his landed property, and now he had his answer—though
it broke his heart to hear it. With an effort he pulled himself
together and fumed through clenched teeth:

“If that’s the case, then the government is definitely failing
to do its duty by us landowners!”

“I wouldn’t say that. After all, the government’s always
issuing large quantities of bonds and giving you landowners who
come to the city a chance to get rich! The opportunity to make
a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollars at one
stroke is not to be sneezed at!”

Whether naturally or deliberately it was hard to say, Li
Chuang-fei’s voice was the acme of calmness and his face wore
a cheerful grin as he gave this reply. Feng Yun-ching was heart-
broken and on the verge of tears; nevertheless, he had at ladgt
made up his mind about the dilemma in which he had found

himself since Ho Shen-an’s visit: he had decided that he had no
alternative but to throw everything he had into a do-or-die effort
to regain his fortunes on the Exchange. His voice trembled as
he raised his head and said:

“But I’m ruined! How can you sit there and talk about me
making a fortune? Though—Chuang-fei, just what is this plan
of yours?”

Instead of replying immediately, Li Chuang-fei drew deeply
at his cigarette, then calmly began blowing smoke-rings into
the air. He knew that once he had caught the sly fox he need
not worry about him escaping. He let a good three minutes pass
before he proposed abruptly, “Yun-ching, I think your land-
holdings down in the country could be mortgaged for cash before
it’s too late. Why not dispose of them while you can?”

It was now Feng Yun-ching’s turn to be reticent. He merely
rolled his eyes uneasily and nodded slightly.

“Now, don’t misunderstand me: I’m only advising you for your
own good to dispose of your property.—To get back to the ques-
tion of speculating in government bonds, what I suggest is briefly
as follows. You and I will go into partnership, and the decision
on what to buy or sell will rest entirely with me. If we lose,
we'll go fifty-fifty; if we make a profit, we’ll also go fifty-fifty,
but you’ll give up thirty per cent of your share of the profits as
a special bonus for me. There’s one other thing I must make clear:
When we pay the deposit, you’ll pay sixty per cent, and I'll pay
forty—call this my advantage, if you like. I’ve got a draft for
thirty thousand dollars on a local bank on me, but I don’t want
to discount it before it falls due, because I won’t get very much
for it if I do, what with the crippling charges. And it doesn’t
fall due until the sixteenth of next month—”

“When it comes to cash I’m even worse off than you are,”
Feng Yun-ching assured him hurriedly, which was quite true;
and besides, Li Chuang-fei’s methods were so unorthodox that
Feng Yun-ching decided he could not be too cautious. Not to
be outdone, the versatile Li Chuang-fei immediately found a
chink in the other’s armour and plunged in:

“Come off it! If you’re short of cash, all you’ve got to do is
to mortgage your estate in the country. Matter of fact, I know
a certain major-general who comes from your part of the coun-

try; I can easily persuade him to invest in a bit of property in
his own district. You can safely leave the whole business in my
hands. If you need a few thousand to tide you over the festival,
just let me know and I'll let you have what you want—and with-
out security, too.—There’s just one thing, though: the Exchange
opens again the day after tomorrow, and you'll have to look
sharp about it if you’re thinking of going in again. Whether
you're buying or selling, remember the early bird gets the worm!”

“What would you advise me to do, precisely?”

“Ah! I can give you it in a nutshell. Everybody knows that
the one man who’s made a packet this time is Chao Po-tao, but
the brain behind him is Wu Sun-fu. Wu Sun-fu has a good
friend in the army fighting at the front, and this friend of his
sends him red-hot information about the latest developments.
Now, I know a stockbroker who’s a relative of Wu Sun-fu’s, and
who handles most of Wu Sun-fu’s business on the Exchange—
aman by the name of Lu Kuang-shih. The thing is, I’ve come
to an agreement with this fellow: he’ll tip me off from time to
time about what Wu Sun-fu’s doing in the Exchange, so that
we can follow his line; then, if we make anything out of it,
he’ll get a cut of the takings. How does that strike you? Re-
member, Yun-ching: he who hesitates is lost!”

With this Li Chuang-fei rose to go, smoothing his moustache
with one hand and reaching for his Panama hat with the other.

Just at that moment, the sound of two women quarrelling came
from upstairs. As soon as he heard it, Feng Yun-ching knew
that it was his concubine and his daughter and he became more
distraught than ever. He stood up mechanically, bowed to Li
Chuang-fei with clasped hands, and said hurriedly:

“It was very good of you to call, and I’m most grateful for all
you’ve told me. To tell you the truth, I could do with a few
thousand to see me through, so I think I’ll take you up on your
offer of a loan—I’ll drop in to see you at the hotel tomorrow.”

Li Chuang-fei assented effusively, told Feng Yun-ching the
best time to call, and departed well pleased with himself. As
soon as he had gone, Feng Yun-ching dashed upstairs in a flurry,
intending to make peace between the quarrelling women. As
he reached the door of his room, he heard a crash, followed by
a sneering laugh from his concubine. White as a sheet, he stopped

dead in his tracks. He stood for a moment with his head on
one side, scratching his ear, but almost immediately plucked up
courage, lifted the door-curtain gently aside, and slipped into
the room, where he found his concubine sitting on the opium-
couch, looking as black as thunder, and her maid kneeling on the
floor picking up the fragments of a broken porcelain bowl. There
was a pool of bird’s-nest porridge on the blue and white carpet
in front of the couch. Chin Mah, the hairdresser maid, stood
behind the concubine, smiling to herself and toying with a comb.

Seeing that his daughter was not there, Feng Yun-ching felt
slightly relieved. It looked as though his daughter had made
a lightning attack and retired immediately from the battlefield,
leaving her enemy to vent her rage on the maid.

“So here you are at last!” the concubine sneered. “Are you
sure you haven’t come into the wrong room? You ought to have
gone and seen your darling little daughter first—she got the
worst of it!”

She turned her head sulkily away as she spoke, but at the
same time watched Feng Yun-ching out of the corner of her
eye. He doubled up with laughter, but it had a hollow ring;
then he started taking it out on the maid:

“Huh! You get worse and worse! Can’t you even carry a
bowl of porridge without dropping it? Go on, hurry up and
fetch another—don’t just squat there!”

“Don’t pretend to be telling her off when it’s me you're having
a dig at!” snapped the concubine, jerking her head sharply
round and glaring at Feng Yun-ching, her beady eyes ablaze
with fury. When she saw that he was smiling tenderly at her,
she gave a bitter laugh and went on:

“pyen this little bitch is taking liberties with me—giving me
scalding hot porridge to eat!—Though she’d never have dared to
do it if somebody else hadn’t put her up to it. Now tell me
straight—”

“There, there, my dear. Don’t get so upset about it. Have a
smoke to calm your nerves—I’ll roast you a few beads of opium
myself. Chin Mah, hurry up and do your mistress’s hair. There’s
a special contest at the Ming Gardens at nine o’clock tonight.
Oh, and, Chiu: Mr. Pai’s concubine Wu rang through and sug-
gested a dozen games of mahjong with you first before you all

go off to the Ming Gardens. Look, the sun's going down so you’d
better hurry up. And don’t get so upset over a silly little thing
like that.”

As he tried to soothe her, he tipped Chin Mah a wink to do
up her hair. Then, with a hearty laugh, he settled himself on
the couch and picked up the needle, put a bead of opium on it,
and began roasting it over the flame. Despite his outward cheer-
fulness, he felt thoroughly miserable.

“Yes,” began Chin Mah, trying to cheer her mistress up as she
deftly combed the concubine’s hair into shape, “our Miss Mei-
ching may look like a grown-up, but she’s still only a child,
really, and she doesn’t realize what she’s saying. Later on, when
you feel better, you should explain to her that she must behave
herself, and not upset you like this——Now, what about doing you
a horizontal S, madam?”

The concubine made no reply, for she was thinking about Mr.
Pai’s concubine Wu, a “sworn sister” of hers. The reason why
Chiu had such a hold over Feng Yun-ching was that she had a
certain amount of influence with Mr. Pai through his concubine.
When Feng Yun-ching had first arrived in Shanghai, he had
received threatening letters from kidnappers demanding protec-
tion-money. His concubine did a little string-pulling through
Mr. Pai’s concubine, and was so successful that nothing more
was heard from the kidnappers. It was only then that Feng
Yun-ching realized that a rich man from the country who had
come to find himself a comfortable niche in Shanghai was not
half so powerful as a concubine with her wide social connections.
And this was why he had long ceased to question his concubine
about her night life.

When the maid had picked up the broken pieces and cleaned
up the spilled porridge, she brought in a fresh bowl of bird’s-
nest porridge—this time neither too hot nor too cool. Chin Mah
had finished doing the concubine’s hair and had gone into the
next room to lay out her clothes. Feng Yun-ching had put a
bead of opium in the bowl of the opium-pipe and laid it ready
on the plate, and had now closed his eyes to consider once more
Ho Shen-an’s and Li Chuang-fei’s suggestions. He thought that
if he could believe what Li had told him, then Li’s plan was
much better than Ho’s idea of “snooping.” Of course, the chances

of succeeding would be twice as good if both their plans were
put into execution together. . . . But how could he do what
Ho had suggested? After all, he had the high family traditions
to consider! And another thing: his concubine had already
got the upper hand of him for “special reasons’—what if his
daughter should now get a hold over him in the same way? With
two of them exerting pressure on him, he’d be between the devil
and the deep blue sea! If only he could believe everything Li
Chuang-fei told him! And yet—

At this point his train of thought was interrupted by his con-
cubine’s voice as she sipped the bird’s-nest porridge and clinked
the silver spoon against the bowl:

“It’s the Dragon-boat Festival the day after tomorrow. I sup-
pose you’ve done everything?”

“Eh? What did you say?” asked Feng Yun-ching nervously,
looking up quickly.

“Don’t tell me you don’t know what you ought to have done!
I mean about the presents, of course! Mr. Pai’s Wu and the
others have been very good to you: you can’t very well let the
festival go by without giving them anything!”

“Oh, er—no. I hadn’t forgotten it for a moment. But, my
dear Chiu, you know I’ve lost every penny I had on the Exchange,
and I’m nearly six thousand dollars in debt as well. I was
wondering if you could think of a way of helping me out—”

“If you want me to get you a loan of ten thousand dollars, or
eight, or whatever you want, that’s easy enough, but what about
securities? You don’t think anybody would take your old land-
deeds as security!”

“That’s just it. That’s why I was hoping you’d be able to help
me out. There’s a friend of mine named Li who’s promised me
a loan, but I don’t think I can depend on him. I’ve only got a
couple of days, anyway. I’d be in a bit of a mess if I couldn’t
pay up!”

When he had had his say, the concubine returned to her por-
ridge. When she had finished it, she put her head on one side
and tittered, but said nothing. She knew all about his coming
to grief over the government bonds, but she refused to believe he
was as badly off as all that. If he wanted her to get him a loan,
she had no objection: the money would pass through her hands,

and she could take her commission to meet her own expenses
over the festival.

She began to pick her teeth, and after a while she smiled and
said:

“Of course, I could quite easily borrow a few thousand even
without any security. If I ask my friend Wu for it, she wouldn’t
like to make me lose face by refusing it. But I think we should
try and save face a bit by offering her some security. Don’t you
agree? Now, your land-deeds wouldn’t be any good, but I seem
to remember you’ve got a deposit account of ten thousand dollars
in the Yuan Feng Local Bank. ”

“Er—oh, no! No, we can’t touch that!” Feng Yun-ching an-
swered hastily, springing up and all but overturning the opium-
lamp as he did so. His concubine pursed her lips in annoyance
and snorted scornfully, then lay down on the couch, picked up
the pipe, and began drawing noisily at it.

“No, we mustn’t use that money, Chiu,” Feng Yun-ching gasped
in horror, creasing his brow. “It belongs to Mei-ching. When
her mother died, her uncles got together to discuss what to do
with the money she’d left, and they decided to set aside this
ten thousand dollars and put it in the bank, and it wasn’t to be
touched until Mei-ching marries and takes it along with her as
her dowry.”

From the dowry his thoughts travelled back to just after his
wife’s death, when he had acquired this concubine despite the
protests of Mei-ching’s uncle. His brother-in-law had not liked
the concubine from the moment he had clapped eyes on her, and
had told Feng Yun-ching: “This woman with her flat round face
is sure to bring you bad luck and ruin you: I can tell it from
her features.” As if in fulfilment of the prophecy, his luck had
become worse from year to year, until he had found himself in
his present straits. He sighed involuntarily, then glanced quickly
at his concubine to see if she was reading his thoughts, and was
rather disconcerted to find her sharp eyes on him. As he caught
her eye, he looked uncomfortably away and stared at the sizzling
bowl of the opium-pipe, an uneasy smile on his face.

Fortunately for him, it seerned she had not noticed his changes
of expression, for she merely moved her pipe an inch or two

away from her mouth, breathed out two plumes of grey smoke
from her nostrils, and said in an unusually gentle voice:

“Very eager to be a father-in-law, eh? Yes, everything’s ready
for the wedding, dowry and all—all you want now is for your
future son-in-law to come and kowtow to you. But don’t kid
yourself—it won’t work out like that at all! You seem to think
you’re still—pah! You’re dreaming! Wake up, do!”

“What d’you mean?—”

“Don’t you really know or are you only pretending not to?”
She tittered. She seemed more exultant than angry.

“I don’t understand—”

“No, and I don’t understand either why a girl of good family
should not prefer to have a big, stylish wedding and why she
should even turn her nose up at nice, fat dowry of ten thousand
dollars or so—”

“Chiu!” cried Feng Yun-ching goaded beyond endurance.
She sounded to him as if she was revelling in his discomfiture,
but with two pipefuls of opium inside her there was no stopping
her, and he did not have a chance of getting a word in edge-
ways.

“Don’t you shout at me! I’m only a poor ignorant girl and
I don’t understand these new ways—not like your daughter!
She’s a student, a modern girl; she speaks English, and has her
own way of doing things: once she’s taken a fancy to a man,
she’d just sneak away with him. These modern girls have got
their own way of showing respect for their parents—they just
marry themselves off, and their parents just have to lump it!”

She laid down the pipe and shook her head disapprovingly.
Her face was serious now.

“1 don’t believe it!’ Feng- Yun-ching burst out, his face quite
pale now. His straggly moustache twitched nervously, and his
eyes glazed. He stared at his concubine with a mingled look of
suspicion and alarm. One question kept preying on his mind:
Was it inevitable that she would take advantage of her freedom
to elope with some man or other? But the concubine had fur-
ther shocks in store for him:

“you don’t believe it? All right, so I’m making it up, then!
But just you wait and see! He looks like a good-for-nothing
student; comes from away somewhere; funny-looking chap—

probably one of these Communists that you hear about. Anyway,
I don’t expect you’d be very keen on him as a son-in-law. But
even if you’re not it won’t make any difference—these new-
fangled girls are as slippery as eels!”

Feng Yun-ching felt like a criminal who has just heard his
sentence pronounced: his fate was sealed. He gulped and looked
wildly about him, his fingertips trembling. When he closed his
eyes, he could see Ho Shen-an’s flabby round face with its leering
smile—a smile which he now realized to be one of mockery. ...
The so-and-so must have known all along about the shameful
way Mei-ching was carrying on, and he probably only came to
make fun of me! As this thought suddenly flashed through
his mind, he felt a strange sensation, for he was not sure whether
to be furious with his daughter for her bad behaviour and her
disregard for him, or whether to be piqued that such an affair,
with a man of her own choice, might stand in the way of the
plan which Ho Shen-an had suggested. Whichever it was, he felt
that all was now lost.

Just then he felt a soft hand stroking the pit of his stomach
and heard an even softer voice murmuring tenderly in his ear:

“There, there! You mustn’t upset yourself like that. Perhaps
I shouldn’t have told you.”

Feng Yun-ching shook his head dismally and squeezed her
stroking hand. After a short pause he moaned:

“This house is disgraced! It’s all come as such a shock!—But
I’ve never known Mei-ching to stay out all night—she’s always
in by eleven or twelve at the very latest. And during the day
she’s at school, so she—she—but I just don’t see how she can ever
have had the time to be enticed away by anybody—”

As he said the last few words, a note of incredulity crept into
his voice, which his concubine was not slow to notice. A flush
of anger sprang to her cheeks as she snatched her hand from
his chest and spat in his face.

“Pah! You doddering old fool!” she blazed. “Keep your in-
sinuations to yourself! Yes, I know I don’t come home till morn-
ing every day: well, what of it? If you think I’ve got a lover,
just you try and prove it!”

He stared back at her in silence, while a smarting bitterness
welled up inside him and his momentary flush of embarrassment

gave way to an angry lividness. He could scarcely contain
himself any longer, and was just going to give vent to his rage,
when a second blow fell:

“Well, I do have other men, so there! Mr. Pai’s Wu and I
team up together and go out hunting. You just go and ask her
if you don’t believe it!”

She rounded this declaration off with a cynical laugh and
slumped back on to the couch, where she busied herself with
the roasting of another bead of opium. The mere mention “Mr.
Pai’s Wu” had struck terror into his heart. He was like a dog
on a lead, and his concubine needed only to mention Mr. Pai’s
concubine casually to bring him to heel—in this case, to make
him realize that, even though she picked up with men outside,
she had Wu’s backing, and that he would have to like it or
lump it. There was nothing Feng Yun-ching could do about it
now but smile submissively and beg her pardon.

Fortunately for him, she was in a hurry to get to her mah-
jong party, and seemed willing to let it go at that. He fussed
around her until she had changed and driven off, without so
much as a glance over her shoulder, in the car that had been
ordered for her. Once she was gone, he breathed freely once
more and turned to the problem of what to do about his daugh-
ter. He paced up and down, his face ashen and his lips
quivering. He was not only angry with her for bringing dis-
grace upon his “family traditions,” but was also rather irked
that she had not had the sense to make better use of her physical
charms. One thought kept running round in his head: Now that
she’s cheapened herself and surrendered her innocence in this
senseless and indiscreet manner, why shouldn’t I draw her into
Ho Shen-an’s scheme? Even though I am her father, there
wouldn’t really be anything wrong in it. A self-satisfied smile
began to spread across his face, but gave way in a flash to a
frown as a sudden misgiving assailed his ranging mind: What
if his daughter should decide in favour of her lover and refuse
to have anything to do with this brilliant scheme? Chao Po-tao
was well into his forties and, although he had a stalwart frame,
there was not the least thing attractive about him.

The sudden raucous cry of a crow on the roof just outside the
window made him start up in surprise. “If she does refuse,” he

muttered through clenched teeth, “she’s got no consideration at
all for her father—none at all!”

He agitatedly paced round the room several times, then looked
up at the electric clock: ten past six. Another day as good as
gone. It was late, and he had no time to waste. He made up his
mind and cleared his throat as if to reassure himself: he was
going to have a talk with his daughter.

*

Feng Mei-ching was in her room writing a letter to her friend,
explaining why she would have to cancel their plans for a gay
time over the holiday. She could not very well say that her
father would not give her the money, and she was hard put to
it to find a suitable pretext. She tried at first to write in Chinese,
but she found it did not read very smoothly, so she stopped in the
middie, and tore it up. She changed to English, but found to
her annoyance that the words she wanted now were not the ones
her teacher had taught her, nor could she find them in her reader;
in fact, she was stuck halfway through the first sentence. She
rested her chin on her left palm and racked her brains for a
while, then shifted it to her right hand, her Parker pen still
between her fingers. Her cheeks were delicately flushed and her
eyes clear and sparkling, though slightly tired. Finally, unable
to concentrate any longer, she fell to doodling on the writing-
pad. Suddenly, she heard the knob turn in the door, and her
father came into the room.

She had not expected that it would be her father, and with a
little “oh!” of surprise she bent her head over the desk and tried
to cover up the untidy pad with her arms, at the same time gig-
gling nervously. Silent and suspicious, Feng Yun-ching peered
round the room as if looking for something, but he saw nothing
unusual, just the usual litter of sheet-music, handkerchiefs,
powder-pufts, scent-bottles and lip-sticks lying all over the place.
Having completed his survey, he came and stood before his
daughter, wondering just how he should begin.

Mei-ching had stopped giggling, and now looked up into her
father’s face. He seemed to sense a certain resentment in her
clear gaze, and dropped his eyes, only to find himself favoured
with a generous side-view of her firm, jutting breasts. He was

immediately conscious of a strange sensation, as if he had only
just realized that she was already a woman. At the same time
he felt resentful of the blow she had delivered at his paternal
authority by carrying on as she pleased behind his back. His
anger rose, and he began in an unexpectedly stern voice:

“Mei-ching, you... you’re no longer a child!—”

She giggled again, and her father, finding it hard to maintain
his stern manner, paused a moment, then went on in a pleasanter
voice:

“Yyou’re already seventeen, Mei-ching, and there are a lot of
bad men about in Shanghai. You must be very careful who you
make friends with, and not let them take advantage of you—”

“Take advantage of me?” she protested, standing up. “Who’s
taken advantage of me now?” She had frowned a little, but at
the same time some of the colour had left her cheeks. He quickly
forced a smile and decided to modify what he had been going to
say.

“I mean they might be imposing on your generosity,” he ex-
plained, and his voice was milder still. “Just think: how much
do you spend a month? About a hundred and fifty dollars, don't
you? You could never spend that much on your own! I was
thinking somebody might be sponging on you, eh?”

“You want me to account for my pocket money, Daddy? All
right: I can tell you my expenses from memory now, if you
like.”

“Oh, there’s no need to do that. But I would like to tell you
something: I crashed completely on the Stock Exchange this
time. Now, that means somebody else has made quite a lot.
And do you know who it is that’s made a pile this time, Mei-
ching?—A man named Chao. He’s got a room in a hotel, and
strolls round a certain roof-garden every evening—a big, imposing
sort of man in his forties. A great collector of gems and
diamonds—you ought to see his fingers. ad

Feng Yun-ching suddenly stopped and just stood there hum-
ming and hawing, his faltering gaze wandering distractedly over
her face. He had now come to the crucial point, and could not
make up his mind whether to come straight out with it or
whether to go at it in a roundabout way by first offering her an
inducement. Suddenly a third idea struck him, adding to his

mental confusion; it was nothing clear-cut, just a vague uneas-
iness stirring at the back of his mind. He suddenly wished the
skies would fall and the earth open up and swallow him, and
with him his daughter, Chao Po-tao, the Exchange—everything.
As he looked at his daughter’s sparkling eyes and her gently
heaving breasts, he suddenly imagined a most improper scene,
which in turn was followed by another highly improper scene
with himself as the chief actor. And then he seemed to hear
someone whispering in his ear: “Your concubine isn’t your first
wife, so you can let her do as she likes; but your daughter’s
your own flesh and blood.” He shivered. His heart was pounding
and he was on the verge of tears. All this passed through his
mind in a flash~so quickly that he had no chance to weigh the
alternatives and decide what to do.

It was at this juncture that Mei-ching gave him a dazzling
smile and blurted out:

“Oh, I know who you mean, Daddy—Chao Po-tao!”

“You—well!” Feng Yun-ching gasped in astonishment. The
mental turmoil instantly ceased, leaving only two impressions in
his mind: amazement and delight. His immediate reaction was
to fire a question at her, though his voice trembled slightly as he
spoke:

*Do you know him? How did you get to know him?”

“I’ve a friend—a girl friend, who knows him.”

“You're sure it’s Chao Po-tao? Chao Po-tao the stock-king,
the famous big bull, a big, imposing-looking man?—”

“Yes, that’s right,” Mei-ching answered rather impatiently.
“That’s him all right!” She picked up a handkerchief and dab-
bed at the corner of her mouth, giggling softly. She could not
understand why her father should be so agitated and surprised,
though she had noticed a slight look of disappointment when she
had told him that it was one of her girl friends who knew Chao
Po-tao. But he had not finished with her yet:

“This friend of yours, Mei-ching—is she older than you, or
younger?”

“Oh, I suppose she’s about three or four years older.”

“Ah, that means she’s twenty-one or twenty-two. Where’s
she from? Is she married?”

“Er—was: her husband died last year.”

“She’s a widow, then. Strange! Wait a minute, what does
she look like? Has she ever been here?”

“But, Daddy! Why do you want to know all this?”

“Ah, I have my reasons, Mei-ching, I have my reasons. You
just tell me what I want to know, and later on I'll tell you all
about it. Now, has she ever been here?”

Mei-ching did not answer at once. She sat down, smiled at
her father, and began twisting her handkerchief round her finger.
Suddenly she gave a musical little laugh and said, “No, she
hasn’t but you must have seen her—you may even know her.”

“Eh?”

“She often goes to the Exchange. She's bit taller than me, and
she has a little, oval face with a few faint pockmarks beside her
nose—though you wouldn’t notice them unless you looked. She
has a slender waist, pretty lips, and a well-developed figure,
and she walks like a European. Can’t you think now who she is,
Daddy? She’s always down at the Exchange. Her name’s Liu
Yu-ying, and her father-in-law’s Lu Kuang-shih, the stockbroker.”

“aht Lu Kuang-shih, eh?” Feng Yun-ching cried excitedly.
“Yes, that’s the Lu Kuang-shih Li Chuang-fei was telling me
about this afternoon!”

He nodded his head repeatedly as if he had managed to solve
some knotty problem. After a moment he turned and peered
closely at his daughter’s face, as if comparing her features
with Liu Yu-ying’s. Then, taking a deep breath, he inquired
anxiously:

“But this friend of yours is related to Chao Po-tao, isn’t she?”

Instead of replying, Mei-ching gave a strange little laugh and,
tilting her head on one side, she shook her long wavy hair, her
eyes fixed on the floor. Then, with a sudden titter, she raised her
head and looked at her father.

“What does it matter whether she’s related to him or not?”
she exclaimed. “Anyway, she’s—oh, Daddy! What do you want
to know all these things about her for?”

Feng Yun-ching could not help laughing, for now he understood
everything. So she was not so innocent, after all. Everything
was predestined, and the best thing he could do was to resign
himself to the inevitable. As this general idea had quite taken

possession of him, he got down to the point straight away, weigh-
ing his words carefully:

“Ive got a very good reason for asking all these questions,
Mei-ching. It’s like this. This man Chao Po-tao seems to have
the devil at his elbow—every time he speculates in government
bonds, he pulls off a victory. This last time he netted well over
a million dollars. We bears were all expecting a nice slump,
seeing that the Central Army was getting the worst of it against
the North, so you can guess how surprised everybody was when
the situation suddenly changed in favour of the bulls. Your
father went flat broke overnight, Mei-ching! But don’t you
worry: I’ve still got a good chance of winning back the money.
The only trouble is that they’re in the know and I’m still in the
dark. That’s where I’m sunk. There’s only one thing to do,
and that’s to ferret out Chao Po-tao’s secrets. This man Chao
Po-tao may be clever, but he’s got one great weakness—he’s too
fond of the ladies. A woman can twist him round her little
finger and find out just what she wants! Now, this girl friend
of yours is on good terms with him, isn’t she, Mei-ching? That’s
a godsend: I’m saved! And now I’m entrusting you with an
important mission: you’re clever, you’re pretty ...oh, you
know what I mean, of course.”

Feng Yun-ching heaved a deep sigh of relief and grinned sheep-
ishly at his daughter. Suddenly he was assailed by an over-
whelming inner conflict: on the one hand, he was afraid his
daughter would shake her head; on the other, he was afraid
to see her nod in acquiescence. But Mei-ching looked quite
natural and showed no signs of embarrassment as she smiled
and nodded her head. She had not quite taken her father’s
meaning, and thought that he wanted Liu Yu-ying to ferret out
Chao Po-tao’s secrets for him.

When he saw her nod her head, Feng Yun-ching’s heart missed
a beat, but almost immediately he felt curiously peaceful. He
drew a little sigh of relief—the die was cast! There was nothing
for it now but to sit tight and see it through. An inevitable
situation had forced him upon an inevitable course.

“What if Liu Yu-ying’s not willing?” Mei-ching suddenly
asked in a low voice. Her cheeks had crimsoned and her eyes
were fixed on the floor as she spoke. She moved restlessly in

her seat, and kept twisting her handkerchief round and round
between her fingers. Feng Yun-ching was stumped for a mo-
ment. This time it was he who misunderstood his daughter. He
could only assume she was not experienced enough after all,
child that she was. She looked up at him with twinkling eyes,
as if waiting for a clear-cut answer. He put as bold a face as
he could on it:

“You silly girl! Surely you don’t need me to tell you that?
You'll just have to sail with the wind. As she’s a friend of yours,
you must know just how jealous she’s likely to be. If you think
it better not to try and hide it from her, then don’t. On the
other hand, you can go ahead on your own if you think it better
to give her a wide berth—”

“Oh!” cried Mei-ching faintly, leaning back against the back
of the chair. Holding her face in her hands, she began giggling
uncontrollably. Feng Yun-ching quickly made his escape before
she could ask any more of these questions which he as a father
would find it embarrassing to answer.

Scarcely had he sat down in his room downstairs when she
appeared carrying a crocodile handbag, as if she was just going
out.

“Give me some money, Daddy,” she said, pausing in the door-
way and kicking her high-heels against the doorsill, as if anxious
to be away without more ado. “I can’t very well go visiting
friends without a penny in my pocket.”

After a moment’s hesitation Feng Yun-ching handed over a
hundred dollars. He felt he ought to say something more to
her, but when he had seen her to the gate and watched her
spring lightly into a rickshaw, he had still said nothing. He
stood absently for a while at the gate, half satisfied and half
sorry. As he turned to go back in, a charcoal drawing on the
whitewashed wall beside the gate caught his eye. It was a
hastily-scrawled tortoise, representing a time-honoured Chinese
insult. Nearby, a couple of slogans, boldly daubed in thick black
printer’s ink: “Join in the Thirtieth of May Demonstration” and
“Support the Soviet.” He caught his breath and went suddenly
pale, then shivered and walked dazedly back to his room, where
he sank down on the couch, feeling sick at heart—how he hated
those peasants and Communists! It was all their fault, with their

rebellions and disturbances, that he had to come and seek ref-
uge in Shanghai, and once in Shanghai, he had been obliged
to turn a blind eye to his concubine’s dissolute night-life, to specu-
late in government bonds, and finally even to employ his own
daughter’s charms to get information and save himself. So far
as he could see, this whole series of misfortunes was locked in
a logical sequence, and it was all due to the fact that the peasants
had taken to rioting and abandoned the temperate ways of their
forefathers. He sighed bitterly and said to himself:

“So now it’s come to this: I’ve given both my concubine and
my daughter away to be communized! To think that I of all
people should be making a contribution to the ‘communal wife’
system! And that it should happen here in Shanghai of all
places! It doesn’t make sense—it just doesn’t make sense!”
IX

THE next day was the anniversary of the famous “May Thir-
tieth Massacre,” and the Dragon-boat Festival was only two
days away. While some of the citizens of Shanghai, like Feng
Yun-ching for example, were bustling around trying to raise
enough money to tide them over quarter-day by employing every
trick from using women as decoys to blackmail, a number of
other citizens were busily engaged in something of a totally dif-
ferent nature: organizing a demonstration to mark the anniver-
sary. Within the past few days, the telegraph poles in the main
streets and the walls of the big houses in the side-streets had
been scrawled and plastered all over with slogans of every de-
scription. It had already been made public that the demonstra-
tion would be held in Nanking Road—the scene of the original
incident.

The police authorities of the Chinese section, the French Con-
cession and the International Settlement had already met to
discuss how they should co-ordinate their various measures to
prevent the demonstration. On the day itself, at about nine
o'clock in the morning, the Settlement police set up a five-mile-
long cordon from the west end of Nanking Road to the Bund
and then down to the north end of North Szechuan Road. The
whole route was being continually patrolled by armed police on
foot and motorcycle combinations mounted with light machine-
guns. At strategic points, armoured cars had been parked
across the roads with their machine-guns trained on the busier
street intersections.

At the west end of Nanking Road mounted police patrols gal-
loped through the traffic and the crowds in a flurry of flying
hooves and foam-flecked bits.

About this time, two young men and a girl, all in their early
twenties, were strolling past the race course in Tibet Road, head-
ing northwards towards Nanking Road. As they walked along,
they looked expectantly about them and chatted among them-
selves. The two young men were dressed in European style:
one was respectably dressed in light grey, with knife-edge creases
in his carefully-pressed trousers, while the other wore a shabby,
dark-blue suit with baggy, untidy trousers. The girl wore a long
dress of peacock-green gauze lined with white silk. Needless
to say, the sight of this incongruously attired trio walking at
such a time and in such a place attracted a certain amount of
attention.

When they reached the New World Restaurant, they stopped
to gaze at a mounted patrol of three policemen trotting past,
the barrels of the rifles slung on their backs gleaming in the
morning sun. They stood watching until the patrol was out of
sight, then the girl said with an air of impatience:

“Where are we going? We’ve drifted up and down this road
three times already. I’m just... fed up! Hadn’t we better
stop and wait in one place?—Though I suppose you’re going to
disagree again, Pai Ching? Besides, it’s nearly half past nine,
and still nothing’s happened. I can’t see the demonstration com-
ing off at all today with all these policemen about.”

“Don’t shout so, Su-su: there’s a sergeant coming!”

“H’m! If you’re so chicken-hearted, Chih-sheng, you shouldn't
have come out with us in the first place—Are you sure you
didn’t get the time and place wrong, Mr. Pai?”

“No mistake about it,” answered the young man in the baggy
trousers, “Tsai Chen told me quite clearly that they were going
to start from Muddy Bridge, go straight down Nanking Road to
the Bund, then turn into North Szechuan Road, and break up
at the range near the park. And it starts at ten, so there’s no
hurry, Miss Chang; there’s half an hour to go yet,”

The speaker, Pai Ching, was a fellow-student of Wu Chih-
sheng’s. They had been standing there more than five minutes
when they noticed a couple of hefty-looking fellows—apparently
plain-clothes men—coming towards them with a menacing air.
Su-su was the first to notice them, and when she did so she
tugged at Pai Ching’s coat and started moving away When she

reached the side-entrance of the race course, she turned round
to the young men following her and said:

“Did you see those two men in black gowns? They looked for
all the world like twin brothers of that bodyguard of Wu Sun-
fu’s!”

As she spoke, she gave a little giggle of delight, for today’s
little adventure had come as a welcome break in the dull mono-
tony of her life, and the appearance of the detectives had cheered
her up just when she was getting tired of walking up and down
without running into anything exciting. When Wu Chih-sheng
had told her the day before that a fellow-student of his by the
name of Pai Ching was taking him along to join in the demonstra-
tion, she had promised herself plenty of excitement and fun. She
had hardly been able to sleep during the night, and early in
the morning she had dashed round to the college to fetch Wu
Chih-sheng and his friend. In the matter of enthusiasm, she
left them far behind.

When Wu Chih-sheng and Pai Ching turned round to look,
the two men in black had disappeared. A red police van drew
up and stopped nearby, but it soon drove off again, its horn blar-
ing hideously.

“That’s the van they take them away in,” Pai Ching told
Chang Su-su, and his face took on a more serious expression.
She smiled, but said nothing, for she was absorbed in watching
the crowds milling round at the corner of Nanking Road and
Tibet Road. She felt sure that there must be quite a lot of peo-
ple among the crowd who were only waiting for the signal to
begin the demonstration, and her face became flushed as she
felt a wave of excitement rising inside her.

Wu Chih-sheng was also gazing all round him, puzzled that
he did not see any of his fellow-students or acquaintances in
the crowd. He looked up at the clock above the grandstand
and saw that it was still only twenty minutes to ten. Feeling
suddenly hungry, he turned to Pai Ching and was going to sug-
gest that they go for a snack first, but he thought better of it
and said instead, “I wonder what’s happening at the front. Have
you heard from your family lately?”

“So far as I can see, it’s a case of ‘when Greek meets Greek.’
My home town’s been bombed flat and my people have gone to
Pengpu. These blasted warlords—”

The rest of what he said was lost as a No. 1 bus pulled up
in front of them. Half a dozen passengers got off and a handful
of people waiting at the stop got on. When the bus moved off,
the three of them were left standing alone there. Just then a
Sikh policeman came up to them, tapped Wu Chih-sheng on the
shoulder with his truncheon and told them to “Move along
there!’ They moved along. Back past the New World Restau-
rant they went, then turned down along Tibet Road.

This time the road looked quite different. Four mounted
policemen were strung out across the road, holding on to their
saddles with one hand while they turned this way and that,
watching for signs of trouble, as if they were prepared to dash
forward at the first suggestion of a disturbance. Along the road,
three mounted patrols with two riders apiece were strung out
at forty-yard intervals, and were engaged in breaking up knots
of bystanders along the sides of the road. A motorcycle carry-
ing two European sergeants raced past at a frantic speed, fol-
lowed by an armoured car which advanced majestically, hooting
like a soul in torment all the way along the road. The crowds
along Tibet Road were now denser than ever and at the corners
of the five side-streets which formed right angles with Tibet
Road the crowds were surging this way and that like the tail-
race of a millstream. Chinese, European and Indian patrols
wheeled round and round, brandishing their truncheons and re-
volvers in a desperate effort to keep back the crowds, which
were already breaking through the cordon here and there.

Wu Chih-sheng, Pai Ching, and Chang Su-su now found it
impossible to stand still at any one spot without being moved
on by the police, so they decided to move farther down the road.
As they were passing a leather-goods shop, a man of about thirty
in European clothes dashed up and grasped Wu Chih-sheng by
the shoulder.

“Hey! Chih-sheng!” he shouted. “Don’t go that way! It’s
dangerous!”

This was Ko Chung-mou, a friend of Chiu Chun, the lawyer.
He was a newspaper reporter and also a frequent visitor to Wu
Sun-fu’s house.

Before Wu Chih-sheng could reply, Chang Su-su broke in,
“What’s happening down there? Has anyone been arrested?”

“Ah, Miss Chang! So you’re here too, eh? Joining in the
demonstration or just out to see the fun? If it’s fun you're after,
Miss Chang, I should advise you to get back home as quick as
you can!”

“What do you mean?”

“I think you know what I mean. You get people coming to
a demonstration like this for one of two reasons: either they’re
against it, or else they’re ardent supporters. People who just
come to watch the fun would be well advised to keep out of it.
Frankly, Miss Chang, I don’t think you’re a whole-hearted sup-
porter, even though you’re not against it—”

“Well, what are you doing here, then, Mr. Ko?” Chang Su-su
retorted hastily, looking slightly belligerent. She resented Ko
Chung-mou’s scornful tone, and his implication that she was a
frail, timid creature. The reporter, however, held up his camera
and waved it under her nose.

“What am I doing here?” he smiled. “I’m a journalist. Mine’s
a free profession, and I’m here as an independent observer!”

With a brief nod he was off across the road, swinging his
camera as he went.

Chang Su-su gave a contemptuous laugh and glanced at Wu
Chih-sheng and Pai Ching as much as to say: “I suppose you
look down on me because I’m a girl, too! Well, just you wait.
T’ll show you what I’m made of!” Just then, a disturbance broke
out among a crowd across the road, and police-whistles shrilled
around them. Chang Su-su trembled all over with excitement,
and, without a word to her two companions, she flew across the
road towards the scene of the disturbance. But before she
could get there, the crowd dispersed before a couple of policemen,
who had appeared among them brandishing their truncheons.
This made Chang Su-su pause, and she stood there hesitantly,
craning her neck to watch. Suddenly, a firecracker went off
nearby—the signal to start the demonstration. It was followed
immediately by a chorus of shouting from the crowd, which,

though fairly small at first, was quickly joined by demonstrators
rushing up from all sides. Chang Su-su felt a tingle of excite-
ment, and her heart began thumping wildly. She started for-
ward mechanically, though in her agitation she did not know
quite what to do. Hearing a sudden clatter of hooves bearing
down on her from behind, she ran quickly to the side of the
road in the general stampede. She looked round to see the patrol
charging a knot of demonstrators not far away from her. They
scattered, but quickly formed up again and pressed on up the
road, chanting slogans at the top of their voices and scatter-
ing leaflets as they went. They were mostly students and work-
ing people. Chang Su-su, her heart pounding with excitement
and her cheeks flushed, just stood and laughed. Suddenly a
voice behind her bawled:

“Stop the warlords making civil war! Down with—”

Chang Su-su turned round to look and saw that it was Pai
Ching. He glanced at her quickly, but did not speak, then darted
out to join the ranks of the demonstrators, who were just pass-
ing by where Chang Su-su was standing. They were being har-
ried from behind by a large detachment of police on foot, and
a short distance behind these followed mounted patrols and
armoured cars. Chang Su-su was swept along up the road by
the crowds of spectators, only to meet another detachment of
police bearing down on them from the other direction and wield-
ing their truncheons. The crowd scattered in all directions, and in
the stampede somebody caught Chang Su-su by the hand and led
her out of harm’s reach. It was Wu Chih-sheng. He was look-
ing rather distraught, but managed to smile at her. When they
reached the Hsin Hsin Department Store, they saw that the main
body of the demonstrators had forced their way past the junc-
tion of Nanking Road and Chekiang Road and had split up into
small groups. Chang Su-su heaved a sigh of relief, but her ex-
hilaration had given way to depression. She was in no mood
for laughing now, and she felt cold down to the tips of her
fingers. The demonstrators, now in groups of seven or eight,
were still circling around the blocks dominated by the three big
department stores of Nanking Road, shouting slogans. As Chang
Su-su and Wu Chih-sheng stood in the crowd milling round in
front of the Hsin Hsin Department Store, a red police van sud-

denly hurtled round the corner from Yunnan Road and stopped
right in front of them. Half a dozen policemen jumped out and
began rounding up the demonstrators there. Panic-stricken,
Chang Su-su turned and tried to run into the store, but was
stopped by a group of salesmen shouting “Keep out!” and clos-
ing the iron gates. Wu Chih-sheng had already made a dash
for the other side of the road, and Chang Su-su now took the
plunge and ran after him. When they reached the pavement on
the opposite side of the road, she grasped his hand again, and
found that both their hands were trembling and clammy.

The ground here was strewn with leaflets, and Wu Chih-sheng
and Chang Su-su trampled on them in their flight. The police-
whistles continued to shrill, and the noise made it impossible to
hear what the demonstrators were shouting. Wu Chih-sheng and
Chang Su-su both looked pale and shaken. Seeing the Ta San
Yuan Restaurant just ahead of them, with its doors still open,
they dived in, just as another wave of shouting rose behind them
in the street. Without even a glance over her shoulder, Chang
Su-su ran straight up the stairs to the first floor.

*

The restaurant was filled to overflowing, and they despaired
of ever finding a seat. They had only come in to hide for a
while, but once in, their appetites were sharpened by the aroma
of food. They had to stand in a corner waiting for a vacant
table, disappointed and frowning, until a helpful waiter suggested
that they should share a table with a gentleman who had al-
ready been there half an hour, not so much eating as reading
newspapers. At first, the customer was apparently unwilling to
share his table, but when Chang Su-su peeped over into his
cubicle he saw her, threw aside his newspaper, and stood up,
shaking with laughter. It was Fan Po-wen.

Chang Su-su gave a little cry of surprise when she saw who
it was, then burst out laughing with him.

“So it’s you, is it?” she cried. “And on your own, too! What
are you hiding in here for?”

“Let me guess,” put in Wu Chih-sheng, sitting down on Fan
Po-wen’s left. “You’re not waiting for anybody, and you don’t
seem to be here for the benefit of your stomach, so you must

be collecting material for your poems——in other words, to see
the demonstration!”

As he spoke, he picked up the newspapers and found they con-
sisted of a complete set of that morning’s tabloids.

With an indignant glance at Wu Chih-sheng, Fan Po-wen
turned to Chang Su-su:

“It’s a good subject, but this time they bungled it. I’ve seen
practically all of it from beginning to end. By the way, what do
you think of my grandstand view from here? You can see
everything from Muddy Bridge at one end to the Sunrise Tea-
House at the other. Though as a poet I must say again that they
bungled the demonstration this time, and I couldn’t very well
leave them out and only describe the policemen prancing around
like a lot of monkeys and the armoured cars crawling along like
great tortoises. No, I’m not a cringing poetaster licking the
hand of authority: I think one should also paint the other side
of the picture. In that immortal epic, the Iliad, Homer may
sing the praises of the heroes on the Greek side, but he doesn’t
forget a word of praise for the brave Hector. The only trouble
with today’s performance was that the demonstrators just weren’t
up to scratch.—To tell the truth, Su-su, it wasn’t that that I
eame here for today, but for something else—though I was
disappointed in that, as well!”

“Also connected with getting inspiration for your poetry?”
asked Chang Su-su rather absently, at the same time running
her little finger down the menu and indicating to the waiter
what she wanted. Fan Po-wen blushed, sighed, and nodded re-
luctantly, but said nothing. He wanted to have his secret dragged
out of him, rather than tell it voluntarily, but this was too subtle
for Chang Su-su, who always abandoned an unanswered ques-
tion, as the rules of social etiquette demanded. Besides, she
was eager to talk about the demonstration, in which she had, in
a way, taken part in person. But Wu Chih-sheng, who knew
Fan Po-wen inside out, threw aside his newspaper and clapped
him on the shoulder.

“Come on, out with it, poet!” he growled with mock severity.
“What are you skulking in here for on your own?”

Fan Po-wen, looking ill at ease, shrugged his shoulders and
gave a hollow laugh. Chang Su-su also laughed, though rather

out of sympathy for the cornered poet than anything. She was
just going to change the subject in an effort to save his face,
when she heard a tap on the partition, followed by the sound of
a woman giggling in the next cubicle. Then a voice asked:

“Ts that you, Su-su?”

There was no mistaking Lin Pei-shan’s voice. Fan Po-wen
blushed more furiously than ever and Wu Chih-sheng roared with
laughter.

Chang Su-su seemed to realize what it was all about, for she
glanced quickly at Fan Po-wen, and slipped out of the cubicle.
In a moment or two she came back hand in hand with Lin Pei-
shan, followed by Tu Hsin-to, a stick hanging from his arm and
a straw hat in his hand.

No sooner had they come in than Lin Pei-shan rested her head
languidly on Chang Su-su’s shoulder and, looking at Fan Po-
wen out of the corner of her eye from behind Chang Su-su’s
loose, bobbed hair, she began teasing him.

“Po-wen, I’d like to give you a present: a packet of visiting
cards printed like this: ‘Fan Po-wen. Pastoral poet and detec-
tive-story writer. How would that be?”

She giggled, and they all burst out laughing. Fan Po-wen
joined in the laugh, and immediately seemed more cheerful. He
bowed slightly to Lin Pei-shan, at the same time placing his
right hand flat on his chest in a Buddhist monk’s salute. He
then shook hands with Tu Hsin-to and asked with a smile:

“and what about you, Hsin-to? What are you going to give
me?”

“Me?—Oh, I'll give you a copy of Shakespeare’s masterpiece,
Love’s Labour’s Lost,” Tu Hsin-to answered calmly, with a supe-
rior smile. He had changed back into Chinese dress today, and
his lean frame was draped in a long, navy-blue flannel gown,
giving him the air of a worthy descendant of some famous
scholar. Fan Po-wen winced at this sly dig, but he covered up
his annoyance with a smile, as if he were grateful for the offer,
and said:

“well, let’s hope I don’t get hold of the wrong partner in our
masquerade.”

“Good for you! but I don’t mind telling you that as a newcomer
I can’t yet imagine myself taking part in your masquerade!”

At this, the two of them shared a knowing laugh. By now,
Lin Pei-shan and Chang Su-su were engaged in an animated con-
versation, while Wu Chih-sheng sat opposite them and nodded
his confirmation from time to time. Chang Su-su was telling
Lin Pei-shan how she had taken part in the demonstration and
of the narrow escapes she had had. She had by now forgotten
all about her trembling, clammy hands and her panic at the
time, and when she looked back on it all, all she could remember
was how the main body of the demonstrators had withstood the
attempts of the mounted police patrols to disperse them, and
how they had eventually broken through the police cordon and
marched straight up Nanking Road. She told Lin Pei-shan how
her enthusiasm had been fired so that she jeered at the charging
patrols, regardless of her personal safety, as they swept down
upon her. As she spoke, her face became flushed again, her
eyes gleamed with excitement, and the more she went on, the
more fluent and unrestrained she became. Lin Pei-shan listened
wide-eyed, her hand gripping Chang Su-su’s. Suddenly she in-
terrupted, her voice shrill with excitement:

“Oh, Su-su! How awful! To think of all those Sikhs on those
huge horses of theirs charging up behind you! Ugh! Chih-sheng,
did you see that horse brush past Su-su’s head, and almost knock
her over and trample on her? Oh, my dear!”

Wu Chih-sheng nodded and laughed excitedly.

But Chang Su-su did not share his amusement. Her expres-
sion was grave now as she borrowed the tiny lace handkerchief
which Lin Pei-shan was wearing for ornament in her lapel, and
dabbed at her forehead with it. She was about to go on when
Lin Pei-shan grasped both her hands and exclaimed:

“And your friend actually shouted a slogan, Su-su! Well!
And was it then that the policemen chased you up to the Hsin
Hsin Department Store? And did they arrest your friend then?”

As she said this, Lin Pei-shan turned to Wu Chih-sheng, who,
not having heard properly what it was all about, nodded me-
chanically. Chang Su-su did not know what had happened to
Pai Ching, but when she saw Wu Chih-sheng nod in agreement
with the suggestion that he had been arrested, she jumped up
with a sudden ery, flung her arms round Lin Pei-shan’s neck
and shook her unceremoniously,

“So that’s one young man sacrificed for the cause!” she exulted.
“But he’s only one—one that we saw with our own eyes, and
one that we knew! Oh, what a man—what a hero! To have
broken through a cordon of policemen and mounted patrols and
armoured cars! Oh, I shall never, never be able to forget this
day!”

“TI saw two or three men arrested, too,” Fan Po-wen told Tu
Hsin-to with an inexplicable sigh, “and I’m perfectly certain
that one of them was only an innocent passer-by.”

The latter nodded without emotion and made no comment. Fan
Po-wen glanced over his shoulder at Chang Su-su, and when
he saw what a state of excitement she had worked herself up into,
he could not restrain another sigh. He said loudly:

“Rverything’s going downhill! Even the mass movement has
degenerated to an unbelievable extent! Five years ago I took
part in the famous Thirtieth of May demonstration, and on that
day—well, ‘the world is world, and man is man!'—on that day,
I tell you, masses occupied Nanking Road all day long! Now
that was something like a demonstration! But today, all they
did was to break through the cordon! Small beer for anyone
who’s been through the real thing! Frankly, I thought today’s
affair rather a bore.”

Chang Su-su and Lin Pei-shan turned to stare at Fan Po-wen
in astonishment. Coming into the world later than Fan Po-wen,
they had not witnessed the actual incident themselves, and they
could only gape tongue-tied at Fan Po-wen’s blasé judgement,
not knowing whether to believe him or not. Their astonishment
only served to make Fan Po-wen feel all the more pleased with
himself. He sat staring out of the window at the sky, apparently
engrossed in intoxicating memories of the stirring deeds of five
years ago, until a sudden splutter of cynical laughter behind him
brought him back to earth. Wu Chih-sheng had been listening
to him in silence, but could now contain himself no longer.

“T thoroughly agree with you when you say that everything’s
degenerated, Po-wen—just look at yourself, for instance! Five
years ago, you took part in the demonstration, but what are you
doing today? You sit up here in a restaurant looking on with
a jaundiced eye like Nero fiddling while Rome burned!”

Fan Po-wen turned slowly and smiled wanly at Wu Chih-
sheng with apparent unconcern, then cast a hopeful glance at
Chang Su-su and Lin Pei-shan as much as to say: At least
you two believe me, don’t you? But they said nothing: they just
smiled knowingly at each other. He was beginning to feel rather
embarrassed, when Tu Hsin-to came to his rescue.

“What’s so wonderful about occupying Nanking Road for a
whole day, anyway? That sort of thing’s always happening
abroad. Townspeople are very restless and they’re always mak-
ing trouble—”

“You call it making trouble, do you?” Chang Su-su protested
indignantly, at the same time shaking Lin Pei-shan’s shoulder
vigorously. Unabashed, Tu Hsin-to answered in a cool, firm
voice:

“Yes, that’s just what I do call it: making trouble. Just go
through all the history books—Chinese and foreign, ancient and
modern—and you won’t find a single country making herself
wealthy and strong by such methods as agitation and demonstra-
tion. They’re nothing but the acts of ignorant people guided by
impulses—destructive, not constructive, acts.”

“Then perhaps you'll be good enough to tell us what acts are
constructive, and not destructive,” Wu Chih-sheng hastened to
ask before Chang Su-su could say anything, tugging at her
wrist as he spoke. Instead of replying, Tu Hsin-to smiled and
began quietly whistling the Marseillaise. Fan Po-wen blinked
in surprise, and Lin Pei-shan tittered. Chang Su-su puffed out
her cheeks and turned to Wu Chih-sheng:

“There’s no need to ask him that—he’ll tell you the government
should use the mailed fist, the same as his uncle Tu Hsueh-shih
is always telling us!”

“That’s just where you’re wrong, Miss Chang,” said Tu Hsin-
to, the smile never leaving his lips. “My contention is that
there’s no ruling a country like this with any sort of policy.”

This proposition was greeted with an immediate outcry of pro-
test from Chang Su-su and Wu Chih-sheng. Fan Po-wen, on the
other hand, reached out and patted Tu Hsin-to on the back, then
gave the “thumbs up” sign, flourishing his hand under Tu Hsin-
to’s nose as he did so. Just at that moment the waiter came
in with their order, and as Fan Po-wen’s arm swung out it

almost knocked the food out of his hands. This was too much
for Lin Pei-shan, whose stified amusement now gave way to
shrieks of laughter as she supported herself on her chair with
one hand and held her side with the other.

“Po-wen, you—” Chang Su-su began, intending to scold Fan
Po-wen, but her scow] changed to a smile as she went on:

“Hsin-to, you and your uncle Hsueh-shih make a perfect pair.
You're too cold and he’s too hot, so that your family are the
proud possessors of one of each kind: one hot and one cold!”

“Thanks for the compliment,” said Tu Hsin-to. “Since it’s
summer at the moment, it’s much better to keep cool.— Well,
let’s have some pastries—that’s one thing I do like hot!”

He gave a dry laugh, then sat down and started on the pastries.
As if transferring her exasperation to the food, she took a pastry
and bit viciously into it, then turned angrily to Fan Po-wen:

“and what about you? I suppose you’re just lukewarm?”

“Fte’ll make poetry out of anything,” put in Wu Chih-sheng,
seeing an opportunity of making fun of Fan Po-wen. “Warmth,
coldness, arrests, bloodshed—all’s grist to his mill!”

Actually, he was even more annoyed with Tu Hsin-to than
with Fan Po-wen, but he intended this sally against Fan as an
indirect attack on Tu. Anyway, he thought, they were both
tarred with the same brush, and differed only in degree. He
could not remember when he had come to this conclusion, but
the conviction had steadily grown as their competition for Lin
Pei-shan had become increasingly obvious. Having delivered
his dig at Fan Po-wen, he glanced at Tu Hsin-to and then Lin
Pei-shan. Tu Hsin-to, still impassive and undisturbed, chewed
silently and meditatively; Lin Pei-shan, leaning against the back
of Chang Su-su’s chair, was absorbed in her own thoughts.

Ignoring Wu Chih-sheng’s taunt, Fan Po-wen went and sat be-
side Chang Su-su. Suddenly he took a deep breath and mut-
tered, “I become hot at the touch of something hot, but I don’t
necessarily become cold at the touch of something cold. I’m
not averse to a bit of leg-pulling, but deep down inside me I’m
actually quite serious. I’ve always wanted to do something
really serious—something to shake me out of the rut.—By the
way, why didn’t you call for me this morning? Don’t tell me

you’d decided I wouldn’t go with you!—Oh, and that friend of
yours that was probably arrested—I’d like to get to know him.”

Chang Su-su smiled and took another dumpling as she an-
swered.

“You should have told me beforehand that you wanted to come
along? How was I to know you’d want to? As a matter of
fact—”

She paused and looked quickly round at Lin Pei-shan who
was still slumped sideways against the back of her chair gazing
blankly into space. Chang Su-su laughed mischievously and was
going to make a further sarcastic remark, when she noticed that
Lin Pei-shan was blushing furiously. This made Chang Su-su
laugh all the louder. At this juncture, Tu Hsin-to picked up a
chopstick and began tapping it on the table. A faint, cynical
smile lingered round his lips as he burst into an ancient poem:

Our youth like lightning flashes by,
Like wind time passes soon;

On grass yet green the frost is white;
With sunset comes the moon.

Black hair fades with the fading year,
And soon turn grey it must;

The noble change to storks and apes,
The mean to fleas and dust.

Chang Su-su frowned at this and snorted. As she did so, the
door of the cubicle swung open, and there appeared in the door-
way a peering pair of spectacles perched on a large, prominent
nose. The spectacles were as thick as the bottoms of tumblers,
and the quaintly questing head belonged to Li Yu-ting. He was
apparently still trying to make out how many people were there
and who they were. His sudden appearance took Chang Su-su
unawares, and she fidgeted uneasily. When Tu Hsin-to saw him
he put down the chopstick and rose to greet him, at the same
time casting a meaningful glance at Chang Su-su.

“What brings you here, Professor Li?” he asked. “Have vou
been here long?—-Perhaps you’re taking lessons in detective-story
writing from Fan Po-wen?”

“You're asking for it, Hsin-to!” said Fan Po-wen, shooting Tu
Hsin-to a reproachful look. He noticed that Chang Su-su was

looking rather ill at ease now that Li Yu-ting had appeared.
Unconscious of all this, the short-sighted professor groped his
way across to the table and beamed at the others.

“Ah, so there are five of you! All taking refuge in here, eh?
The streets are just packed—and the police are being rather
rough. And what with my bad eyesight, I had rather a job
making my way through the crowds. In fact, I had a narrowish
escape a moment ago—”

“Eh? D’you mean to say the demonstration is still on?” asked
Wu Chih-sheng hastily through a mouthful of dumpling.

“Yes, it is, indeed. I was going along Tung Hsin Bridge Street
in a rickshaw, when I ran into a procession of several hundred
people, armed with bottles and stones, fighting with the police.
While I was there somebody must have thrown some leaflets
into my rickshaw—I was too busy telling the rickshaw boy to
get a move on to notice at the time. Just as we were coming
into Ta Hsin Street, we ran into another lot of policemen round-
ing up demonstrators. They happened to see the leaflets on me,
and stopped me on the spot. I showed them my card, but they
still wouldn’t let me go. I appealed to a sergeant, but that wasn’t
any use, either. In the end they took me off to the police station
—rickshaw and rickshaw boy as well. They treated me very well
at the station, and after some explanation they soon let me go
again. Even now, the atmosphere in Nanking Road’s still very
tense—big crowds everywhere, milling round and round. And all
the big shops are bolted and barred—”

Li Yu-ting suddenly broke off, whereupon Fan Po-wen threw
back his head and roared with laughter, pointing at Wu Chih-
sheng with one hand and at Chang Su-su with the other. He
was just going to regale Li Yu-ting with an account of their
“adventures” in the demonstration, enlivening it with a few
brilliant shafts of wit which he had just thought up, when a
sudden uproar was heard in the street just under their window,
and there was a rush of feet as people in the restaurant stam-
peded to the head of the stairs. Fan Po-wen, pale and speechless
with fright, ducked his head as if he was going to dive under
the table, while Chang Su-su and Wu Chih-sheng rushed to the
window to see what was happening. Li Yu-ting stood there

wringing his hands in agitation, and Lin Pei-shan cowered in
the corner, her eyes and mouth wide with fear.

Only Tu Hsin-to seemed unperturbed; though the colour had
left his cheeks, he still managed to force a smile to his lips.

“Huh! Not worth going to look—it’s all over now,” said Chang
Su-su disappointedly as she came back from the window. When
she looked round and saw the agitated expression on Lin Pei-
shan’s face, she could not help laughing at her. Lin Pei-shan
peered apprehensively around and asked:

“What happened? Oh, Su-su! Weren’t you afraid of being
hit by a stray bullet?”

Chang Su-su shook her head, but it was not clear whether this
meant she was not afraid of stray bullets, or whether it meant
she did not know what all the noise in the street had been about.
Still in need of reassurance, Lin Pei-shan glanced at Tu Hsin-to
inquiringly. She had noticed just now that he seemed perfectly
calm as if he had known all along that everything would be
all right.

“Who cares what happened, anyway?” exclaimed Tu Hsin-to
with an air of utter nonchalance and a sidelong glance at the
two girls. “In any case, it couldn’t be serious. I’ve every con-
fidence in the ability of the foreigners to keep order! As a
matter of fact, I don’t see why the authorities in the settlement
should get in such a stew and take such strict precautions—they
only cause a panic doing that.”

Li Yu-ting shook his head as he listened to Tu Hsin-to. He
was more certain than ever now that Tu Hsin-to was nothing
more than a frivolous young hedonist. Unable to restrain him-
self any longer, he took a step forward and rasped, “Don’t be too
optimistic! At this moment Shanghai’s heading for a crisis, too.
Just look at the way rice has gone up to twenty dollars a picul
and the way prices in general are shooting up. Since March
there’s been one strike after another—the trams, the buses, the
cotton mills. They say the Communists are planning a general
strike for some time in May—”

“Well, have they done it? Today is May the thirtieth, isn’t
it?”

“Yes, I suppose May is practically over—but that doesn’t mean
to say that the danger of a crisis has passed! In the North, the

war is getting bloodier and bloodier, and in the South, Chang
Fa-kuei’s Kwangsi Army is marching on Hunan Province; the
whole country will soon be drawn into the maelstrom of civil
war. Everywhere the peasants are rioting, and there’s no tell-
ing how many groups of bandits are taking advantage of the
situation to give themselves out as Communists and hoist the
red flag. Only a few days ago something happened in your part
of the country: out of one battalion of the local garrison two
companies mutinied and went over to the Communists. The
Communists will expand their activities every day that the
civil war drags on. June and July will be worse still, so the
worst is yet to come—”

“But Shanghai—”

“ven in Shanghai the situation is getting worse day by day.
Only these last few days they discovered that Communists had
infiltrated into units stationed around Shanghai, and they even
found Communist leaflets and groups in the city garrison itself.
They say that quite a large proportion of the troops are un-
reliable now. Even the workers at the arsenal have got a secret
organization. And this morning, despite all the precautions of
the Settlement police, the workers and students held the demon-
stration just the same and even broke through the police cordon.
How can you blame the Settlement authorities for ‘getting in a
stew’ about it?”

Li Yu-ting’s voice gradually dropped lower and lower as he
spoke, but his words were like thunder in the ears of his lis-
teners. Tu Hsin-to’s frown deepened, but he said nothing. Chang
Su-su’s face was flushed and her eyes alight with excitement.
Wu Chih-sheng tugged at Fan Po-wen’s jacket and said half
in jest and half in earnest:

“Just wait, Po-wen! It won’t be long now before you have
something to write about!”

Fan Po-wen nodded quite seriously, then turned to Li Yu-ting;
he was just going to say something, when Lin Pei-shan cut him
short, “Anyway, Shanghai should be safe enough. We can al-
ways pop across into the International Settlement or the French
Concession!”

Before Li Yu-ting had time to reply, Tu Hsin-to put in, “Oh,
yes, Shanghai is safe for one or two days at least yet, perhaps

for another week, another month, or two months, even. Apart
from Shanghai, a few other large ports like Tientsin, Hankow,
Canton, Macao and so on are also safe for a few months yet.
And after that we have Japan, France and America that are even
safer. Yes, there are still plenty of places in the world safe
for our leisure and pleasure. Why should we worry about it?”

Relieved by his assurances, Lin Pei-shan giggled. She was a
gay, lively girl, and did not see why she should allow the pros-
pect of unknown dangers looming ahead stop her from enjoying
herself while she could. Yet the others apparently felt quite
differently about it: Li Yu-ting gazed in amazement at Tu Hsin-
to for a while, then looked at Wu Chih-sheng, then at Fan Po-
wen. He seemed to be looking for someone to join him in a
serious conversation. At length, he went on with a sigh:

“If the war goes on and on like this, and if the politicians,
the businessmen and the students here at home all split up into
quarrelling groups and factions, like the people fighting at the
front, I can see the total collapse of the nation just round the
corner. When the Tsarists were removed from power, they
could flee the country and live abroad, but when our turn comes,
we shan’t be so lucky, I fear, because by that time revolutions
will be breaking out all over the world, and the propertied
classes in every country—”

He broke off and bent his head in thought, heart-broken be-
cause the government, the party leaders, and the heads of so-
ciety could not sink their differences and stop squabbling among
themselves. This thing he had on hand now, for instance: Wu
Sun-fu had entrusted him with the job of going along and nego-
tiating with Chao Po-tao on his behalf—patching up a quarrel
between them, actually. Ever since he had run into the demon-
stration in Tung Hsin Bridge Street, he had been turning a prov-
erb over in his mind: “A powerful enemy is not so much to
be feared as dissension in one’s own camp.” What grieved him
now was to see the enemy’s inroads widening and deepening the
split in his own camp.

He was startled abruptly out of his gloomy musings by a laugh.
It was Tu Hsin-to, leaning against the doorpost, a cynical smile
on his lips. When Li Yu-ting looked round, he began reciting
a poem quietly as if to himself:

Make merry, and take no heed for the morrow:
With women and wine forget your sorrow,
Drown your cares in sparkling wine,
And in soft arms yourself entwine.

Then he suddenly raised his voice: “I say, everybody, why
do we have to bury ourselves in this god-forsaken hole on such
a glorious day? I know of a wonderful new pleasure-garden run
by a White Russian émigré—Rio Rita’s. They’ve got good wine
and good music, and there are White Russian princesses, princes’
daughters, imperial concubines and ladies-in-waiting to dance
attendance on you. Green, shady trees and lawns as smooth
as velvet. And then there’s a little lake for boating... ah,
jt reminds me of the happy hours I spent on the banks of the
Seine ... lily-white bosoms and thighs... and the burning
passions of the French girls!”

As he said this, he turned and took his hat and stick from a
hook on the partition. He seemed surprised that his suggestion
brought no response from the others. Nevertheless he smiled
calmly as he went across to Lin Pei-shan, held out his hand to
her, and said with a slight bow:

“Miss Lin, if you were going home, perhaps Miss Chang would
go with you for company—”

With a puzzled smile, Lin Pei-shan darted a glance at Chang
Su-su and the others, then, as if she had made up her mind, she
nodded and departed arm in arm with Tu Hsin-to.

At this Wu Chih-sheng gave Fan Po-wen a meaning look, but
the poet passed it off with a careless laugh and proceeded to take
it out on Li Yu-ting:

“You may be a professor, Yu-ting, but you do talk a lot of rot!
All your preaching and theorizing runs off Tu Hsin-to like water
off a duck’s back—it just makes him all the more determined to
enjoy himself while he can. ‘Tonight we have wine, so tonight
we get drunk! He doesn’t give two hoots for all your weeping
and wailing and gnashing of teeth!”

“Oh, give it a rest!” exclaimed Chang Su-su. “Let’s go up
to North Szechuan Road. Chih-sheng, didn’t Pai Ching say the
procession would break up somewhere around there?”

So saying, she threw a note on the table and turned to go,
followed by Wu Chih-sheng. Fan Po-wen hesitated a second,

then shouted “Just a minute,” and, with a fleeting smile at Li
Yu-ting, ran down the stairs after them.

Left alone in the cubicle, Li Yu-ting leaned out of the window
and strained his eyes to see what was happening in the street.
The crowds had begun to melt away and he could see the three
of them walking abreast with Chang Su-su in the middle, chat-
ting and gesticulating gaily. A doubt assailed his mind as he
watched them out of sight: What were they going to North Sze-
chuan Road for?—Although he had not quite caught Chang Su-
su’s last few words, he had a shrewd idea of her intentions from
her expression; in any case, he was well enough acquainted with
her temperament and ideas to be able to guess. And isn’t this
just another indication of the inevitable disintegration of the pres-
ent time? With this pessimistic thought, and a growing sense
of despondency, he shook his head, and, with one last look down
into the street, he made his way out of the restaurant.

*

Once out in the street, he walked westward. Arriving at the
Hua An Building, he glanced at his wrist watch: half past ten.
He went in and took the lift to the fourth floor. In the corridor
he scribbled a few words on his card and gave it to a page.
After a considerable wait, the white-liveried page returned and
showed him to a luxurious suite—two rooms and a bathroom—
looking out over the race course. The bathroom door stood ajar,
and the other two rooms were filled with scent-laden steam.
Since his glasses had immediately misted over, Li Yu-ting saw
everything through a white haze. Suddenly, he seemed to see
the blurred outline of a white figure flash past him and disappear
into the bedroom, leaving behind a trail of heady perfume and
the echo of a woman’s silvery laughter. Li Yu-ting quickly wiped
his glasses with his finger and peered round again. He saw Chao
Po-tao curled up on his side on a sofa, wearing a cream-coloured
flannel bathrobe, his hairy legs propped up on one arm of the
sofa. He was, of course, resting after a bath.

Chao Po-tao did not get up: he just nodded casually, vaguely
waved a hand at Li Yu-ting, and then turned his head and called
towards the bedroom:

“Yu-ying! Come on out! Come and meet Mr. Li here. He’s
near-sighted, and I don’t think he saw you when you went past

him just now.—No, you needn’t dress up: come out just as you
are.”

Li Yu-ting gaped in wonder, wondering what the purpose of
this move was. Almost immediately, the woman appeared in a
haze of perfume, giggling and swaying her hips. A large, snowy
bath-towel was draped round her like a monk’s robe, and as she
tripped across the room with her shoulders thrown back, her
unusually prominent breasts could be seen bobbing up and down
beneath the towel. Her face was small and oval, and her vivid
lips were curved in a persistent smile. Glancing sharply at Li
Yu-ting with a faint grin, Chao Po-tao reached out and pinched
the woman’s plump seat.

“Ouch!” she yelped coquettishly. Chao Po-tao laughed bois-
terously and touched her thigh so that she spun round to avoid
him. He made her twirl round once again, then shoved her
roughly away and grunted:

“That’s enough! Now go back and get dressed—and shut the
door behind you!”

It was as if he had displayed his treasure for a moment and
then quickly locked it away in its casket again. When she had
gone, he turned to Li Yu-ting:

“why! What’s the matter with you, Yu-ting? You’re blush-
ing! Look at yourself in the mirror! Ha! Ha! You're a proper
greenhorn, aren’t you! They say I’m fond of the women: yes,
I certainly do, and I make no secret of it. Hf I do anything,
I do it straight out. I don’t like having people guessing about
me as if I were not an ordinary human being but a fiend —You
yourself, for instance: the moment you came in just now, you
saw I had a woman here, but because of your bad eyesight you
couldn’t quite see her properly. That set you guessing—I could
see it. But now you’ve had a good look at her, and you may
even have recognized her. Not bad, eh? She has the figure and
skin of a European!”

With this, Chao Po-tao suddenly swung his feet to the floor
and stood up. He took a cigar from the case on the table and
stuck it between his teeth, then slid the cigar-case towards Li
Yu-ting with a gesture of invitation to help himself. He settled
himself on the sofa again, propped up his legs, slowly struck a
match, and began lighting his cigar. He looked as if he had not

a care in the world and was now settling down for a good loaf.
Instead of taking a cigar, Li Yu-ting ran his fingers lightly and
absently along the edge of the cigar-case: he was wrestling with
the problem of how to carry out the task entrusted to him by
Wu Sun-fu without bungling and at the same time without offend-
ing Chao Po-tao. He was waiting for Chao Po-tao to broach the
subject first, for he wanted to avoid giving the impression that
he had been specially sent as a negotiator, and he did not want
to appear to be one of the “Wu clique.” But Chao Po-tao smoked
on without a word and hardly glanced at Li Yu-ting. After five
minutes like this, Li Yu-ting could hold out no longer, and
decided to put out a feeler.

“Did you see Sun-fu yesterday, Mr. Chao?”

Chao Po-tao shook his head and took the cigar out of his
mouth as if he was going to speak at last. But, after flicking
off the ash, he put it back into his mouth.

“Sun-iu’s home town’s been plundered by the bandits,” Li Yu-
ting went on, “and he’s lost quite a bit there, so of course he’s
not in a very good mood—in fact, he gets quite short-tempered
sometimes.—For example, there are a couple of things he can’t
agree with you about: the Exchange settlement and the loan to
Chu Yin-chiu. As a matter of fact... .”

Li Yu-ting held on to the “fact” while he watched Chao Po-
tao’s expression closely. He had intended to say “As a matter
of fact, this is a mere trifle” but thought better of it. He decided
to change it to “As a matter of fact, we can easily find a solu-
tion,” but before he could get the words out of his mouth, Chao
Po-tao broke in.

“Oh, it’s that that’s upsetting him, is it? Ah, well, we can
easily find a way round that. But tell me, Yu-ting, have you
come here to talk terms with me on behalf of Wu Sun-fu, or
just to pump me?”

This sudden blow, straight from the shoulder, caught Li Yu-
ting off his guard. True, he had Wu Sun-fu’s terms with him
and also the intention of sounding Chao Po-tao; but now that
Chao Po-tao had called his bluff, he was in a quandary how to
proceed. Not wishing to be caught between two fires, he decided
it would be in his best interests to tread warily and try to please

both of them. He accordingly smiled and hastened to assure
Chao Po-tao.

“Oh, no! Far from it! You and Wu Sun-fu are old friends;
if you had anything to discuss you could do it yourselves with-
out going through me—”

“Of course!” interrupted Chao Po-tao, fixing Li Yu-ting with
a sharp look. “From which we may assume that you’re here to
pump me! All right, then, I'll be quite frank with you. I like
to do things the straightforward way!”

“J quite agree, Mr. Chao; the straightforward way's always the
best,” replied Li Yu-ting. Cornered as he was, there was not
much else he could say. Much as he resented Chao Po-tao’s
merciless directness, he realized it would be the height of folly
for him to attempt any sort of double-dealing with a man like
this. He would have to change his tactics. But Chao Po-tao,
as if he had read Li Yu-ting’s thoughts, threw back his head and
laughed. He stood up and clapped Li Yu-ting on the shoulder.

“vou and I are old friends, too, Yu-ting, so there’s no need
for us to beat about the bush. I don’t believe in having secrets,
myself. In the matter of women, for instance: if Wu Sun-fu
had a mistress, can you see him parading her in public?—Like
to have another look at her, Yu-ting? See what she’s like when
she’s dressed up?—Damn it all, she’s a widow you know! I
don’t usually go in for second-hand stuff, as you know, but this
one’s an exception: she’s not like all the rest—she’s a real houri!”

“Ah, but then you’re a well-known collector and connoisseur,”
said Li Yu-ting, feeling that he had to say something, “so of
course you have to have a specimen of every species!”

He was getting rather worried for he feared Chao Po-tao was
deliberately digressing, but his anxiety was unnecessary, for
Chao Po-tao chuckled his acknowledgement, then returned to the
sofa and began of his own accord to explain his attitude towards
his disagreement with Wu Sun-fu.

“we can skip all the developments to date, as you’re well
enough acquainted with them. Well, to put it in a nutshell, Wu
Sun-fu needn’t worry about the Exchange settlement—I’m will-
ing to accept Tu Chu-chai’s original proposals and let it go at
that. But in the matter of the loan to Chu Yin-chiu, I’ve already

given him my promise, so I can’t go back on it—unless, of course,
Chu Yin-chiu should want to call it off himself.”

As Chao Po-tao spoke, Li Yu-ting scanned his face carefully
and weighed his every word. He was beginning to fear that he
was running his mission on the rocks, for the one thing Chao
Po-tao was insisting on was the very thing Wu Sun-fu was not
prepared to give way on. Wu Sun-fu was determined to com-
pensate himself for his losses in his home town not only by
swallowing Chu Yin-chiu’s factory but also by acquiring the lat-
ter’s large stock of cocoons at the cheapest possible price, then
rush them through his filatures to fill his orders in time. If he
succeeded in pulling off this scheme quickly, he could make
something out of it even while the price of silk was dropping.
Li Yu-ting knew all this only too well, but Chao Po-tao’s shrewd
eyes told him that he had seen through the scheme as well, and
now intended to nip Wu Sun-fu where it hurt most. He would
rather lose twenty or thirty thousand dollars to Wu Sun-fu over
the government bonds transaction than let him get his hands on
Chu Yin-chiu’s factory and cocoons. After a moment’s hesita-
tion, Li Yu-ting sighed lightly and said:

“But it’s just this question of the loan to Chu Yin-chiu that
Wu Sun-fu’s so concerned about. If you’d like my own opinion
as an independent observer—”

“Ah, I know why he’s so interested in the loan,” interrupted
Chao Po-tao, slapping his thigh and laughing triumphantly: “It’s
because there are some clauses about Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons in
the agreement!”

Shaken by this unexpected thrust, Li Yu-ting broke out into
a cold sweat. He was anxious for Wu Sun-fu and miserable at
his own failure. Nevertheless, his anxiety made him abandon
his humming and hawing. He smiled wryly and said in a dif-
ferent tone of voice, “You’re a sharp one, and no mistake! What
stumps me, though, is what use the cocoons are to you. After
all, you and Sun-fu are old friends, so why do you have to
tease him like this? If he doesn’t get Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons,
he’ll be in a bit of a jam—”

Li Yu-ting broke off helplessly here, for Chao Po-tao suddenly
gave a derisive laugh; he tilted back his head and blew a cloud
of cigar smoke, his flabby face wrinkling with amusement. Li

Yu-ting’s scalp prickled at Chao Po-tao’s steely voice when he
next spoke, “You don’t understand? Come now, you're joking!
—Now, I like to keep everything I do above-board, and if a man’s
perfectly frank with me, then I’ll be perfectly frank with him.
Now, Yu-ting, since you’re here as Wu Sun-fu’s deputy, I may
as well put forward a proposal for him to consider: I recommend
Shang Chung-li as manager of Wu Sun-fu’s Yi Chung Trust
Company.”

“Oh, but—er—will, I’ve heard that they’ve already decided to
have Mr. Tang for manager.”

“Yes, so I hear—but I also hear that he belongs to the Wang
Ching-wei clique.”

At this reply Li Yu-ting’s heart missed a beat; he saw it all
now: the tussle between Chao Po-tao and Wu Sun-fu was not of
a purely commercial nature. The realization of this fact made
him despair of ever effecting a rapprochement between the two
sides. Staring at Chao Po-tao with eyes wide with anxiety, he
asked imploringly, “Haven’t you any other ideas, Mr. Chao? What
about—what about having Tu Chu-chai for manager? He’s above
politics, you see.”

Chao Po-tao smiled. “So’s Shang Chung-li!” came his swift
reply.

Li Yu-ting smiled uncomfortably, realizing suddenly that he
had gone a little too far for an allegedly neutral observer, and
decided to put on the brake. He glanced at Chao Po-tao, and
was about to declare that his position was that of loyal friend
to both sides, when the former stretched and said in a more
casual voice:

“So far as Wu Sun-fu’s ability and initiative are concerned,
I take my hat off to him; but I must say that he’s too confident
of his own capabilities, and that, I’m afraid, is where he’ll come
unstuck. That idea of his about forming the Yi Chung Company
was quite a good one, but he didn’t talk it over with me first,
whereas if I’ve got a good plan up my sleeve I always give him
a chance of coming in on it—like our recent venture on the
Exchange, for instance. And if I now suggest Shang Chung-li
as manager of his company, it’s just because I’d like to co-
operate with him. Now, I’m a plain-spoken man, Yu-ting, and
I don’t mind telling you if Wu Sun-fu’s going to be so obstinate

and refuses to come to his senses, that’s quite all right with me.
I only hope he’ll be able to weather all the storms he’s going to
run into. If he can make a go of it, I’ll be the first to congrat-
ulate him!”

Chao Po-tao rounded off his ultimatum with a hearty laugh
as he swung himself to his feet. He flexed his arms and stretched,
then went across to open the bedroom door. Realizing that he
was going to let out his precious nymph once more, Li Yu-ting
hurriedly stood up and made a last appeal:

“Mr, Chao—”

Chao Po-tao turned and looked impatiently at Li Yu-ting, who
started forward and invited with an ingratiating smile:

“Come and have dinner with me tonight. Sun-fu and Chu-
chai’ll be there, so if you’d care to come along, you can talk it
over with Sun-fu himself.”

Chao Po-tao let his gaze wander thoughtfully over Li Yu-ting’s
face for a moment, then replied with a ghost of a smile:

“But if Sun-fu refuses to see sense, I’m afraid your hospitality
would be wasted.”

“Not at all: I’m sure there’s every possibility that he’ll soon
realize that it’s better to play a part in a big show than try to run
a one-man show.”

Li Yu-ting spoke with great assurance, though in his heart of
hearts he feared the result would be exactly the opposite: the
odds were that Wu Sun-fu would refuse to give way to Chao
Po-tao.

Chao Po-tao’s reaction was a guffaw of amusement. He clapped
Li Yu-ting heavily on the shoulder, muttered something in Can-
tonese, then roared in common Chinese, “What? Did you say
he will soon realize it? Oh no, Yu-ting, don’t think you can fool
me—Chao Po-tao! Unless, of course, by ‘soon’ you mean a good
six months. I happen to know a thing or two about Sun-fu’s
tactics. I say six months because I know that if he’s set on
promoting this company of his itll give him a clear six months’
grace. For the first three months he’ll have a fairly free hand,
but after that he’ll begin to feel the strain—he’ll find that lack
of money is cramping his style. And then, if his bankers draw
in the rope a little, he’ll really start feeling the pinch! Just
now, he’s sitting pretty, so he expects the other fellow to come

round to his point of view. As for him coming round to the
other fellow’s—well, another three months and we'll see! Per-
haps sooner!”

“Ah, but you’re taking a long-term view of things, Mr. Chao,
whereas I’m looking at the more immediate problems. Say, for
instance, this problem of getting Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons as a
pledge can’t be resolved the way Wu Sun-fu wants it, then he’s
going to be in a fix: if he hasn’t got the cocoons, he can't keep
his factory running; and if he has to close down—”

Chao Po-tao shrugged and smiled grimly, but Li Yu-ting went
on doggedly:

“Then there’ll be more unemployed. Mr. Chao, you know
as well as I do that since January labour troubles in Shanghai
have been getting worse and worse, so that they’re a serious
menace to public order and safety. In the interest of all con-
cerned, Sun-fu should, of course, make some concessions. But it
would make things a lot easier if you, for your part, would be
good enough to forget about Chu Yin-ch u’s cocoons just this once.”

Having delivered himself of this final appeal, Li Yu-ting felt
easier in his mind. He had done his level best as a mediator,
and had taken care not to pour oil on the flames. He looked
closely at Chao Po-tao’s triangular face, hoping to find there some
sign of assent, but found none. Chao Po-tao shook his head
contemptuously and returned to the sofa. He propped his legs,
and said briefly and without a trace of emotion:

“You're overdoing it.”

This was worse than a slap in the face for Li Yu-ting, and he
flushed hotly. He felt hurt that Chao Po-tao should reject his
good offices so scornfully, and he sat in morose silence for a
while. Nevertheless he decided to brave the storm once more.
He squared his shoulders and was just going to put everything
he knew and all the skill at his command into one last effort
at persuading Chao Po-tao, when suddenly the bedroom door
opened an inch or so, and through the crack a pair of little red
lips chirped:

“Did you want me? I thought you called.”

The lips were replaced by a gleaming black eye. Chao Po-tao
smiled and beckoned. The door swung open and in floated the
woman as daintily as lotus-blossom on the water. She smiled

first at Chao Po-tao, her head on one side, then turned her head
and nodded to Li Yu-ting. Chao Po-tao stretched out his hand
to give her snow-white arm a playful pinch, then burst out:

“Yu-ying, Mr. Li here says the Communists are coming to
Shanghai soon! Are you afraid?”

“What, those little Reds who’re always chalking up slogans
everywhere? Oh, I saw one the other night as I was going
along Chang Pang Road in a rickshaw. When he saw someone
coming, he scuttled away, just like a rat.”

“But when you’re off your guard,” Li Yu-ting put in quickly,
“a Communist can change himself from a rat into a tiger. Youll
find some of these tigers in Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi, and also in
Kiangsu and Chekiang!”

He said this hoping that he would be able to steer the con-
versation back to Wu Sun-fu, but, to his disappointment, the
woman’s lips parted in a smile and she twittered ostentatiously:

“Dear, dear! Tigers, are they? You're kidding!—Well, if they
are tigers, there are always tiger-killers like Wu Sung!”

Chao Po-tao glanced at Li Yu-ting and wound up grimly, “Well,
Yu-ting, you’d better go back and tell Sun-fu what I think about
it. I hope he’ll think it over carefully and let me know what he
intends to do. If there are tigers running amok, I’ll take pre-
cautions, but that’s no reason why I should give in to Wu Sun-
fu completely. Are you free tomorrow evening? Come to the
Great China and we’ll have dinner together and watch the
dancing.”

As he spoke, he stood up and they shook hands, then he saw
Li Yu-ting out into the corridor with a great show of politeness.

Out in the street once more, Li Yu-ting straightened up and
heaved a sigh of relief, then started back the way he had come.
He began turning over in his mind what Chao Po-tao had said,
then suddenly remembered he still had to go to the police station
to bail out the rickshaw boy and his rickshaw. In the Nanking
Road area the police were still taking strict precautions, and the
pavements were still littered with leaflets. A car sped past, mak-
ing a wind which sent the leaflets whirling in all directions. One
of them blew against Li Yu-ting’s chest; he grabbed at it and ran
his eye over it. The few sentences that he read appalled him:

... Under the direction of the imperialists, a con-
certed attack is being launched by the warlords, bureau-
crats, landlords, depraved gentry and compradore-capital-
ists upon the Chinese revolutionary forces in an attempt
to put an end to the revolution once and for all. But the
imperialists and the Chinese ruling classes are divided
among themselves and the divisions are daily widening.
The present mélée between the Southern and Northern
warlords is an indication that their disagreements are com-
ing to a head. At such a time as this, revolutionary
Chinese people must intensify—

Li Yu-ting quickly threw the piece of paper away and fied
in a panic as if he had the devil at his heels. A veil of darkness
seemed to fall before his eyes, and a macabre scene took shape:
Wu Sun-fu was strangling Chu Yin-chiu while Chao Po-tao was
clutching at Wu Sun-fu’s hair from behind. The three of them
were struggling frantically together, heedless of the man who
stood beside them, sword in hand, waiting to strike them down.

“We're doomed, doomed!” his tortured mind cried. His very
bones seemed to turn to water, and his heart was a dead weight

within him.
Xx

AT length, the Dragon-boat Festival came and went in an at-
mosphere of unrest. Merchants found they had to break the old
rule and leave the settlement of their first quarter’s accounts
until the end of the next quarter—the Mid-Autumn Festival.
The war was changing the normal pattern of their life.

“Eat your moon-cakes in Peking!”—So said the government’s
military authorities, meaning that they expected to bring the war
to an end by the Mid-Autumn Festival at the very latest.

Nevertheless, at the present moment, there were still no signs
of the war being brought to an end. Along the Lunghai line the
situation was fluid and both sides were said to be in more or
less the same positions as at the outbreak of the war, while
around Hankow, up the Yangtse, events were moving more
rapidly day by day. It came as a surprise when the combined
forces of Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi suddenly captured
Changsha! That was on June the 4th, two days after the Dragon-
boat Festival. The news threw the Shanghai stock market into
an immediate turmoil of excitement. All sorts of rumours were
rife, and the speculators attached to the Shanghai Stock and
Bond Exchange swallowed these rumours eagerly, while at the
same time they themselves manufactured and circulated new
rumours.

Then came a bombshell: Yochow, a city not far from Hankow,
had been taken by the Red Army commanded by Peng Teh-huai.

Li Yu-ting had been to a Japanese friend to confirm the news
and had come home in an ague of anxiety. For a while he was so
stunned that he could only keep polishing his tumbler-bottom
spectacles with a handkerchief over and over again; then he
decided to go and see Wu Sun-fu and offer him some more ad-
vice. Ever since his visit to Chao Po-tao on the day of the

demonstration he had been very careful not to involve himself
in their controversy, but he was always ready to play the peace-
maker should a suitable opportunity present itself. He had
already made a private attempt to persuade Tu Chu-chai to
exert some pressure on his brother-in-law Wu Sun-fu “in the
public interest,” so that there would be at least some possibility
of a rapprochement between the latter and Chao Po-tao. He had
told Tu Chu-chai that Wu Sun-fu’s obstinacy and over-confidence
would be his downfall.

So Li Yu-ting hurried off to Wu Sun-fu’s house and arrived to
find he had visitors—in the drawing-room were several people
hovering about, seemingly waiting with bated breath to see
whether Wu Sun-fu would smile or frown. They were strangers
to Li Yu-ting, though he seemed to remember seeing one of them
before—a man of about fifty with a little wisp of a beard.

Wu Sun-fu was standing with his back to them, an unusually
tense expression on his face. As he caught sight of Li Yu-ting
coming in, he waved a hand in greeting and called out, “I’m
sorry, Yu-ting, but I wonder if you’d mind waiting a moment in
the small drawing-room?”

He found someone ahead of him in the small drawing-room—
Chiu Chun, the lawyer. He was sitting there with a large port-
folio open on his lap, fiddling with the corner of a sheaf of
documents with one hand and stroking his chin with the other.
He seemed deep in thought, so Li Yu-ting sat down quietly
without disturbing him and began wondering what was afoot:
what with the strangers in the other room, he thought, and a
legal adviser in here, Sun-fu must have something important on
his hands.

In the large drawing-room Wu Sun-fu was pacing up and down
like a caged lion, glancing fiercely every now and then at the
man with the straggly beard and then at the other three men
standing there in awed silence. He suddenly stopped with a
snort and asked the bearded one in an incredulous voice, “Hsiao-
sheng, did you say the provincial government advised us to keep
the Hung Chang Pawnshop open for business?”

“Yes, I did,” replied Fei Little Beard, his eyes fixed on the
floor. “And they said that the local bank, the oil-refinery, the
power-house and the rice-mill must also carry on, The man from

the county council said that the prosperity of the town depended
on your shops and factories and that it would be a terrible blow
to the town if you decided to close them down altogether.”

He himself secretly hoped that the shops and so on would
remain open, but this hope was not motivated by any concern
for the welfare of the town, but rather for the welfare of Fei
Little Beard. Although he was quite sure of being offered another
job in the event of Wu Sun-fu’s closing down all his shops
in the town—a job in the Shanghai factory, say—he much pre-
ferred to remain as Wu Sun-fu’s agent in the town, a position
which afforded him a comfortable living and a certain amount
of prestige. Besides, he had boasted confidently to the county
official that he could easily persuade Wu Sun-fu to change his
mind.

“Huh!” Wu Sun-fu snorted, and grimaced. “It’s all very well
for them to talk about the prosperity of the town, but what
protection can they give us?”

Despite his cynical tone, he was inwardly rather pleased to
hear that the people at home looked up to him as the leader
of the business circles in the town. Shrewdly guessing what
was going on in his mind, Fei Little Beard pursued:

“Just now, everything’s quiet in the town—very quiet indeed.
The new garrison that’s recently taken over is in a different class
altogether to Colonel Ho’s lot that we had before.”

“Tt wouldn’t be too sure about that!” one of the three men
suddenly interrupted. “You don’t need to go half a mile outside
the town to find vourself in Communist territory. They hold all
the villages round about, and they send their patrols right in as
far as West End Market. Oh yes, it’s quiet enough in the town
itself, but the town’s surrounded! The most our one battalion
can manage is to keep the road to the county town open. And
I’ve heard that when they’re sent out on patrol they very often
desert and take their guns with them. The Communists have
got twice as many men and weapons as they had before!”

The speaker was Wu Wei-cheng, a man in his thirties and a
distant nephew of Wu Sun-fu’s who had come in from their home
town with Fei Little Beard.

“And they say they’ve set up some of these Soviets in the vil-
lages!” added a youngster of about twenty who was standing

next to Wu Wei-cheng. He was Ma Ching-shan, a brother-in-law
of Tseng Chia-chu—who had already been staying with Wu Sun-
fu for two weeks—and he had also just arrived with Fei Little
Beard. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him was Tseng Chia-
chu, gaping wide-eyed.

Wu Sun-fu scowled as he glanced at Wu Wei-cheng and nodded
curtly. At this brief nod Fei Little Beard’s heart missed a beat,
for it hurt him more than a good dressing down would have
done. He hastily tried to explain it all away. “Yes, yes, that’s
as may be, but the provincial government’s sending troops down
to surround the Communists and finish them off, so there won't
be any more trouble in the town.”

Wu Wei-cheng gave a cynical laugh and was just going to con-
tradict Fei Little Beard again, when they heard the blare of a
motorcar horn outside the main gate. Wu Sun-fu dismissed them
with an impatient wave of the hand and strode out on to the
front steps to meet the visitor. The slanting rays of the setting
sun threw the shadows of trees on the stone steps, and as the
trees swayed in the breeze, a pattern of light and shade danced
over the five steps. Wu Sun-fu glanced down at the shadows,
then stamped on them in his vexation.

The car drew up in front of the house and Kao Sheng, the
butler, dashed across to open the car door, Tu Chu-chai hurriedly
squeezed out, and when he looked up and saw Wu Sun-fu stand-
ing on the steps, he made a grimace and shook his head. Wu
Sun-fu’s face darkened when he saw that his visitor was the
bearer of ill tidings, but he managed to force a smile of greeting.

“It’s fantastic!’ gasped Tu Chu-chai as he came up the steps,
mopping his face with a snowy cambric handkerchief. “Ter-
rific rise—trading nearly closed!”

Wu Sun-fu said nothing, but just knit his brows in a puzzled
frown. With no more than a glance at Tu Chu-chai, he turned
and went back into the drawing-room. The scowl immediately
returned to his face as he said to Fei Little Beard:

“Now look here! I couldn’t care less whether everything’s
peaceful in the town or not. I opened my shops in the first
place, and if I choose to close them down, then closed down they
will be! I’m not a charitable institution, and it’s no concern of
mine whether trade’s slack in the town or not. I don’t care who

asks me, county council or provincial government or whoever
they are, that’s my answer, and it’s final!”

“Yes, of course, Mr. Wu. That’s just what I told them, but
they—”

But Wu Sun-fu’s patience was exhausted. His lips twisted in
a sneer as he cut Fei Little Beard short. ‘Yes, I know all about
their bluff and nonsense! You still haven’t told me how much
you've collected on the loans that fell due at the Dragon-boat
Festival. You told me last time you could count on sixty per
cent, though I expected more than that, of course. Well, how
much did you collect after all? I suppose you’ve brought the
money with you?”

“Er—no, I haven’t. You see, the people in the town are leaving
last quarter’s accounts over to next quarter-day, the same as
here.”

“What!” roared Wu Sun-fu angrily. This setback was the last
thing he had expected. Although it was only a matter of seventy
or eighty thousand dollars, he was very short of ready cash just
at the moment, and even seventy or eighty thousand would have
come in very handy. He set his face in a scowl and paced up
and down, then paused to look at Tu Chu-chai, who was sitting
on a sofa taking snuff. The sight of Tu Chu-chai reminded him
painfully of the sudden steep rise in government bonds.

His nostrils full of snuff, his eyes closed and his mouth wide
open, Tu Chu-chai was waiting for a sneeze to come.

“If you do close down all your shops, including the local bank,”
murmured Fei Little Beard, coming closer, “it'll mean that we
won't be able to get back the loans even at the Mid-Autumn
Festival.”

Wu Sun-fu shrugged his shoulders; after a moment’s pause he
laughed and spat out, “Hah! the Mid-Autumn Festival, eh?
Well, perhaps by that time I shan’t need to call in my money
from that quarter!”

“Is it just that you’re afraid the town’s still in danger, then,
Mr. Wu?” said Fei Little Beard, seeing an opportunity of deliv-
ering a little speech he had prepared. His eyes shifted uncom-
fortably from side to side as he went on.

“Well, of course, Wei-cheng was exaggerating a bit just now.
—And the provincial government really is sending down a strong

detachment of troops to surround the Communists and finish
them off. As I said before, both the provincial and county
authorities are hoping that you will agree to play your part in
maintaining the prosperity of the town. After all, it is your
home town. And besides, if you close down your businesses
you'll never be able to collect your loans. Under the circum-
stances, I think you’d best give in to them just for the time
being. If you'll just wait till the Mid-Autumn Festival you'll
see that everything will turn out all right in the end. Of course,
the pawnshop is another matter altogether, since it was gutted
in the fire.”

Wu Sun-fu smiled non-committally, then turned and sat down
on a chair. He now had the whole picture: the bandit trouble
had not only lost him fifty or sixty thousand dollars outright,
but it had also pinned down his loans for twice that amount, and
he had no way of touching the money. He began to feel that it
was impossible to make everything under the sun go just the
way one wished. On the other hand, he consoled himself, the
reason things had gone wrong was that it was all happening
miles away down in the country, where he had very little say
in the doings of the troops. Well, just look at the enterprises
he was managing personally: there, everything was running as
smoothly as you like. For instance, the Yi Chung Trust Com-
pany was proceeding according to plan, and Chen Chun-yi’s silk
goods manufactory and a number of smaller factories were about
to fall into his hands.

Thus encouraged, he rapped out his orders to Fei Little Beard
in a brisk, decisive voice:

“I think you’re right, Hsiao-sheng: I ought to do my duty by
the old town. Apart from the pawnshop, which is out of com-
mission, I shall do my best to keep all my factories and shops
going until the Mid-Autumn Festival. But you must get on to
the battalion commander and make sure he’s going to keep a
close watch on the Communists in the surrounding villages.”

Fei Little Beard, his eyes still on the floor, replied with a string
of deferential yeses. Suddenly, he said, “The local bank still
has more than ten thousand dollars in cash left. I was wonder-
ing whether we should leave it where it is—”

“lll leave it there for use in an emergency,” said Wu Sun-fu
quickly, “—for my own shops only. Mind you don’t let anybody
else touch it!”

He dismissed him with a wave of the hand, then stood up and
went over to attend to Tu Chu-chai. Fei Little Beard said “Very
good” and, realizing that that was all, was just going to take
himself off when he saw the wild-looking Tseng Chia-chu still
standing stiffly between Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan near
the window, and he suddenly remembered there was something
else to discuss. He hurried across to Wu Sun-fu again before
the latter had begun talking with Tu Chu-chai and hastily called
him from behind:

“Mr. Wu! There’s just one other thing—”

Wu Sun-fu turned round and glowered impatiently at him.

“It’s about Wei-cheng and Ching-shan,” he said timidly. “They'd
both like to come and work for you in Shanghai. They’re put-
ting up in the hotel with me today, but I’ll be going back home
tomorrow, so I wonder if you could tell me what to do with
them?”

As he spoke he contrived to tip the young men a wink to come
across but they did not budge. Just then, Tu Chu-chai startled
them all with a sudden deafening sneeze. When he had re-
covered, he rubbed his nose and muttered as he did so: “Every-
body’s coming to Shanghai to find work, but they don’t realize
that the people who’ve already got jobs in Shanghai are losing
them! The banks, the factories, the big firms—they’re all laying
off staff and cutting down wages. There are tens of thousands
of unemployed walking the streets with no hope of finding a
job. When the post office advertised for only sixty clerks, more
than a thousand applicants sat for the examinations. People
down in the country just don’t realize what conditions are like
here, and so they keep flocking into Shanghai. I’ve got seven or
eight people down for a job when I can find them one, myself.”

Wu Sun-fu made no comment. He frowned and narrowed his
eyes to scan the two new arrivals. As they stood there beside
Tseng Chia-chu, they struck him as rather more promising than
this young man: Wu Wei-cheng’s square features promised in-
telligence and ability, and Ma Ching-shan was no fool, he judged.
Yes, they both looked quite a bit brighter than Tseng Chia-chu.

It occurred to him that he might be able to make something of
them yet....

Wu Sun-fu beckoned the two young men over and asked them
a few questions about their schooling and past experience.

Meanwhile, Fei Little Beard was hovering around Tu Chu-chai
and regaling him with a few well-chosen honeyed words. When
he saw Tseng Chia-chu still standing there with a vacant expres-
sion on his face, he drew him outside and whispered, “Your
wife asked me to give you a message: she wants you to go back
home as soon as possible.”

“I know. Ma Ching-shan just told me. But I’m not going.
I’m getting cousin Sun-fu to find me a job in Shanghai.”

“Has he found you one? What sort of work are you going to
do? I'd like to know, so that I can tell your wife when I get
back.”

“Tt’s not settled yet. But with my party card I can easily find
a job in a government office.”

Fei Little Beard could not help laughing at this. It struck him
that this self-important young greenhorn must have been rather
a headache for Wu Sun-fu all this time.

*

Meanwhile, the silence had been broken in the small drawing-
room. Chiu Chun, the lawyer, put the sheaf of documents back
into the portfolio, stretched his limbs, and lit a cigarette before
he replied to Li Yu-ting’s last remark,

“Now look,” he argued, “it’s the way of the world—you always
get the big fish swallowing the little fish. Even if what you say
is true about certain Chinese bankers joining forces with the
Americans with a view to bringing Chinese industry under their
control and making the manufacturers their managers, even so,
factory-owners like Wu Sun-fu are still swallowing up their
smaller competitors. As a matter of fact, the fate of seven or
eight such victims has just been sealed, and the papers are in
my case here. In a day or two I'll be going along to see them
as representative of the Yi Chung Trust Company and they'll be
signing contracts handing over the management of their fac-
tories to the trust company—actually, it amounts to making
them into the Wu Sun Company, the Sun Chi Company, or the

Wang Ho Company!... No, Yu-ting, I don’t believe all this
talk about an American-financed trust in Shanghai. In fact, I
rather suspect it’s a rumour put about by Wu Sun-fu and the
rest of them to pull the wool over people’s eyes. I think the
Americans are making enough out of selling their products
here; they’re hardly likely to want to run factories in this coun-
try as well, especially when the country’s in such a bad way.”

“Oh, no, I’m sure Wu Sun-fu isn’t up to anything like that!”
Li Yu-ting assured him confidently. “No. I know all about the
trouble he’s having with Chao Po-tao.”

Chiu Chun laughed and drew hard at his cigarette, then tilted
back his head to look up at the fine workmanship of the grape-
vine-patterned plaster mouldings on the ceiling. Li Yu-ting fol-
lowed the direction of his eyes, then glanced down again at Chiu
Chun and said quietly, “Seven or eight factories at one fell
swoop, eh? Well, you can’t say Wu Sun-fu’s letting the grass
grow under his feet! What sort of factories are they?”

“Oh, all sorts: there’s an electric light bulb factory, a thermos
flask factory, a glass factory, a rubber goods factory, a sunshade
factory, a soap factory, a celluloid factory—none of any size,
though.”

“All bought on the cheap, I suppose?” asked Li Yu-ting quickly;
but Chiu Chun was not to be drawn. Although Li Yu-ting was
a close friend of the family, Chiu Chun felt it would be a breach
of professional honour to give away a client’s business secrets.
He chuckled and changed the subject.

“There'll have to be peace in the country before factories can
prosper.” *

So saying, he tucked his portfolio under his arm and walked
out of the room, closing the door behind him.

The slam of the door made Li Yu-ting jump. He glanced at
his watch and saw that it was just on five o’clock. He had only
been waiting here for ten minutes, but it seemed much longer
than that. Now that he was alone, he felt like someone kick-
ing his heels waiting to be called to an interview. He was be-
ginning to feel thoroughly bored and restless. He stood up and
went across to look at a silk-embroidered picture on the wall—
The Imperial Concubine Chao-chun Leaving the Frontier. Then
he wandered over to the window and stared out at the trees

in the garden. Recognizing Tu Chu-chai’s car parked out in
the drive, he suddenly became more restless than ever: there
were strangers in the other room, then there was Wu Sun-fu’s
legal adviser, who had just left the room, and now there was
Tu Chu-chai’s car parked outside. Yes, it all pointed to some-
thing big in the air, And when Li Yu-ting comes along, it’s
not convenient to see him, so they leave him here to cool his
heels alone—apparently Wu Sun-fu did not trust him any longer!
After all, he thought, he was the same old Li Yu-ting that he
always had been—he had not changed in any way. There was
just that little matter of the dinner he had been invited to by
Chao Po-tao the other night—just the two of them, alone. They
had, it’s true, talked about Wu Sun-fu, but what of it?

A cold shiver ran down Li Yu-ting’s spine. He was under
suspicion—wrongly—and it made him feel frightened and hurt.
He felt he had only himself to blame: he had been too enthusias-
tic about helping his friends, whose interests he had at heart
and whose reconciliation was his one aim. If the truth were
known, Tu Chu-chai had probably let on to Wu Sun-fu that he,
Li Yu-ting, had suggested (though with the best will in the
world) that Tu Chu-chai should try to curb Wu Sun-fu’s insistency
on paddling his own canoe. They probably thought he was a
petty creature trying to make bad blood between them! Perhaps
they were keeping things from him like this because they re-
garded him as a sneaking spy in the service of Chao Po-tao!

There was a side-door leading out into the garden; he was
tempted to slip out quietly that way and have done with Wu
Sun-fu, but on second thoughts he decided that he could not
very well leave without saying goodbye. Suddenly, he heard a
roar of laughter from the people in the other room. He inter-
preted the laughter as meaning “He’s a spy—and he’s shut away
in there!” is heart pounded, and his finger-tips felt suddenly
cold. On an impulse, he gritted his teeth and muttered: “Since
they suspect me of being a spy, I may as well be one for once!”
He tiptoed to the door and had just bent down to put his ear
to the keyhole to listen, when thought better of it. “What's the
use!” he thought. “Even if I play the spy for Chao Po-tao, he
won’t necessarily want me for one!” He straightened up, took
a deep breath, and sank back into a chair. Just at that moment

the door opened, and in came Wu Sun-fu, a smile on his lips.
Behind him came Tu Chu-chai, carrying his snuff-box in one
hand and rubbing his nose with the other.

“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Yu-ting!”’ smiled Wu Sun-fu.
“Just had some people up from home—some slight business I
had to attend to.”

Tu Chu-chai vaguely waved a hand in greeting and was im-
mediately convulsed by one of his sneezes.

“Oh ...Isee...” Li Yu-ting muttered, forcing a smile. He
felt more like crying, for Wu Sun-fu’s smile cut him to the quick.
He stole another glance at Tu Chu-chai, and saw that he was
fiddling with his snuff-box and looking extremely worried.

The three men sat down facing each other and began casually
chatting. Seeing that Wu Sun-fu looked his usual self, Li Yu-
ting felt slightly relieved. He slowly began to feel himself
once more, and decided he would continue his role as the impar-
tial mediator with everyone’s interests at heart. Accordingly,
when Tu Chu-chai mentioned the increased activity of bandits
in the countryside, Li Yu-ting turned to Wu Sun-fu and said
earnestly:

“The news that Yochow has fallen is not a rumour, after all:
it’s true!”

“So it’s true, is it?” smiled Wu Sun-fu casually. “Well, it’s
no more than we expected. Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi
must have Yochow in order to protect Changsha, which is other-
wise isolated and difficult to hold.”

Tu Chu-chai nodded his agreement. Li Yu-ting was puzzled
for a second, then burst out:

“No, it’s not Chang and Pai that have captured Yochow—it’s
Peng Teh-huai’s Red Army! Surely you must have heard the
news, Sun-fu?”

“It’s just a rumour!” said Wu Sun-fu calmly. “Trying to lay
all the blame on the Communists!”

He looked up at the parrot, which was shelling a peanut, and
Li Yu-ting followed his eyes to the bird. Li Yu-ting was rather
nonplussed for the moment, but, his faith in reports from Japa-
nese sources being as unshakable as it was, he decided that Wu
Sun-fu had been misled by propaganda from some other source.
Turning to Tu Chu-chai, he repeated obstinately:

“But it is the Red Army! I’m afraid Sun-fu’s version comes
from someone with an axe to grind. The fact is, while Chang
Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi were attacking Changsha the Red
Army was already storming Yochow. The two cities fell almost
simultaneously. Frankly, Sun-fu, I think all this fighting in
Hunan is giving the Communists a rare opportunity. Really,
Chu-chai, I don’t see why they can’t be satisfied with a final
showdown along the Lunghai line, instead of carrying the war
into Hunan as well, when they know quite well that the whole
province is just riddled with Communists.”

Tu Chu-chai nodded again, but made no comment. Wu Sun-fu
was still smiling, but a slight frown was beginning to appear
on his face. Seeing that he had an audience, Li Yu-ting went
on excitedly, “Just now the situation’s going from bad to worse.
There’s fighting everywhere on both sides of the Yangtse, and
there’s trouble brewing from the Communists in Kiangsi. The
Hankow area is very badly garrisoned, and there are Commu-
nist guerrilla bands operating within twenty miles of Hankow it-
self. In Shasi and Ichang, the local troops and the Reds get
on famously together—like cats and mice living in the same
hole!—”

“That’s right enough!” interrupted Wu Sun-fu. “Only the other
day one of Sun Chi-jen’s down-river boats was commandeered
near Shasi, and he still hasn’t found out whether the troops
who took it were some of the local riff-raff or whether they were
the Reds!”

He stood up restlessly, but sat down again without doing more
than stretch his legs.

“yes, Sun Chi-jen’s certainly had a run of bad luck this month!”
put in Tu Chu-chai, stroking his chin, “First they requisition
his buses, and now one of his steam-launches has vanished. They
tell me it was new last year—hasn’t been in service six months.
It cost him three hundred thousand taels of silver, too!”

Although he seemed to be taking part in the conversation, his
mind was elsewhere: he was worried by the unaccountable move-
ment of the stock market—the whole country was in chaos, yet
government bonds were going up instead of down! He could
make neither head nor tail of it.

Meanwhile, Wu Sun-fu had stood up again and was pacing
round the table, now and then glancing casually or deliberately
at Li Yu-ting, but the latter did not notice his glances at all,
for he was still wondering how he could make Wu Sun-fu realize
that in the present crisis it was his duty to co-operate with Chao
Po-tao. But he was not to have an opportunity to bring the
subject up again, for just then the butler came in to tell Wu
Sun-fu that Chu Yin-chiu was on the telephone. Wu Sun-fu’s
eyebrows shot up and he and Tu Chu-chai exchanged a glance
of surprise. Seeing that he could not very well stay on now, Li
Yu-ting took his leave and departed miserable and frustrated.

A cigar in his mouth, Tu Chu-chai wandered aimlessly up-
stairs. He was trying to puzzle out why Chu Yin-chiu should
have rung. He found the ladies playing mahjong under an
awning on the small roof-garden. Mrs. Wu, her sister Lin Pei-
shan and Wu Sun-fu’s sisters, Fu-fang and Huei-fang, made up
a foursome, while Ah-hsuan and Tu Hsin-to looked on, and the
tiles clicked and rattled drowsily. Seeing her husband approach-
ing, Fu-fang called out:

“Come and take my place for a game, Chu-chai!”

Tu Chu-chai smiled and shook his head, then slowly took the
cigar out of his mouth and wandered over to the table to have
a look.

“Tired?” he asked. “Why not let Hsin-to take over? Anyway,
how much a game are you playing for?”

“T don’t think you could be bothered to play for half-pennies,
Dad!” Tu Hsin-to challenged his father good-humouredly, wink-
ing at Lin Pei-shan,

“Come and join us if you want to, Chu-chai,” invited Mrs, Wu.
“I know you don’t look at mahjong the way Sun-fu does—he
says it’s a slow-moving and tedious game and that if he gambles
at all he prefers fast dice games!”

She gave a pleasant little laugh, but it struck one as rather
vague and absent-minded. But then she was always vague and
absent-minded these days—in fact, while speaking to Tu Chu-
chai just now, she had missed making a pair of “blank tiles.”
They had only played six rounds, and she had already lost her
stake twice. No one seemed to notice her inattention except Tu

Hsin-to. He had noticed it quite casually, but had no idea what
the reason for it was.

His mother had now left her seat, and he sat down in her
place, opposite Lin Pei-shan. Mrs. Wu had also stood up and
was making Ah-hsuan take her place.

“Now,” she laughed, “let’s see you and Huei-fang, the two
amateurs, beat the two experts!” The laugh died away and the
worried look returned to her face. She glanced absent-mindedly
up at the sky and slipped away.

Tu Chu-chai and his wife, Fu-fang, strolled away to the other
end of the roof, away from the mahjong table, and leaned on
the parapet, looking out over the garden. Behind them the game
was now in full swing, and they could hear Ah-hsuan and Lin
Pei-shan above the voices of the other two. Fu-fang turned to
watch them a moment, then said in a low voice, “There’s some-
thing you ought to know: Pei-yao whispered to me just now
that our Hsin-to and her sister Pei-shan seem to be very keen
on each other. He’s always coming round to take her out!”

“Well, what’s wrong with that? Everybody does it these days.”

“Oh, dear! You are slow! Don’t you realize they belong to
two different generations in the family? Pei-shan is a genera-
tion senior to Hsin-to!”

Tu Chu-chai frowned and stretched his hand out over the
parapet to flick the ash off his cigar. He took a deep breath, but
remained silent. With another backward glance at the mahjong
table, his wife went on:

“Pei-yao’s also rather worried about it all, Someone else is
asking for Pei-shan’s hand, and she thinks he’d make a good
match for her.”

“Who is it? Fan Po-wen, I suppose?”

“No: it’s Colonel Lei.”

“Oho, Colonel Lei, is it? But he’s away fighting at the front.
There’s no telling whether he’ll come out of it alive or not.”

“But he’s coming back soon, so Pei-yao tells me.”

Looking rather embarrassed, Tu Chu-chai glanced over his
shoulder at Hsin-to and Pei-shan. After a while, he mumbled,
“After all, they are related, so there’s no harm in their going
around together. The only snag is that morals are so slack these
days, and young people take to the new ways so easily—-anyway,

Hsin-to isn’t a child any longer, and you can’t very well keep
him in check. There’s not really very much you can do about
it, my dear.”

“Fiddlesticks! If anything should happen, both families would
lose face!”

“Well, what do you think we should do, then?”

“Don’t you ever listen to what I say? I wanted all along to
make a match between your brother Hsueh-shih and Pei-shan,
but you wouldn’t hear of it because you said the Lins had no
money—”

“All right, all right, my dear! There’s no need to go bringing
up old scores! I'll speak to Hsin-to later on. Though of course
it all depends on the girl. If she’s really made up her mind and
knows where she stands, I don’t think you need be afraid of
anything going wrong.”

“But her sister says she’s still only a child and doesn’t know
what’s—”

“Humph!”

Tu Chu-chai shook his head as if he did not believe it, but
said nothing more. Just then Mrs. Wu came up to the roof-
garden again, and when she saw Tu Chu-chai and his wife talk-
ing together, she guessed what it was about and shot them a
knowing smile. She went over to the mahjong table to see how
the game was going, then turned and moved daintily towards
Tu Chu-chai and his wife. She was just going to speak, when
suddenly Kao Sheng, the butler, called up from the garden, “Mr.
Tu! Mr. Wu wants to speak to you!”

Tu Chu-chai escaped, and Mrs. Wu, looking hard at her sister-
in-law, asked her, “Did you mention it to him, Fu-fang?”

For answer, Mrs. Tu smiled; then the two women stood with
their heads together and conversed in an undertone for
a while. Only a few words had passed between them when
Mrs. Wu burst out laughing. Afterwards they turned and walked
back to the table to watch the game.

*

When Tu Chu-chai hurried into the study, he found Wu Sun-
fu on the telephone, and the voice at the other end sounded like
Tang Yun-shan’s, They were talking about “the news leaking
out after the Hamburg had loaded and sailed” or some such thing,

but it did not mean anything to him. Finally, Wu Sun-fu said:
“Anyway, come round straight away,” and rang off.

His face tense and excited, Wu Sun-fu sat down opposite Tu
Chu-chai and picked up the list of the day’s opening and closing
prices on the Stock Exchange, which his broker Lu Kuang-shih
sent him every day. He glanced at it, then tossed it aside and
said, “Chu-chai, can you raise five hundred thousand dollars
tomorrow?”

Tu Chu-chai looked at Wu Sun-fu in amazement, but before he
could reply the latter went on:

“The price went up one dollar yesterday, and today it almost
reached the limit: it’s just incredible! I suspected all along that
Chao Po-tao was behind it, and now Tang Yun-shan’s just told
me it’s true. He says Wang Ho-fu has discovered that Chao
Po-tao and some of his Cantonese colleagues are bulling again:
they buy in whenever a low price appears, but not a large quan-
tity—they just buy enough to peg the price and hold it at what
it was before the fourth of this month—”

“In that case we're sunk!” broke in Tu Chu-chai agitatedly,
throwing away his cigar stub. “We should have covered yester-
day!” Tiny beads of sweat began to appear on his forehead.

“Eyen if we had covered yesterday, we should still have made
a loss. The situation’s quite clear: what with the Hankow area
being threatened and the fighting along the Lunghai line drag-
ging on, prices are bound to drop sooner or later. If only we
can stop the rise and keep the price down, we've got nothing to
fear. It’s now a battle of wits between Chao Po-tao and us! If
they’re really set on buying in whenever the quotation goes down
and if they keep it up till the end of the month, then they "ll win.
If, on the other hand, we have sufficient reserves—”

“Tf we've sufficient reserves, and if we sell every time there’s
a rise, and keep it up till the end of this month, then we'll win—
is that what you mean?” As he said this, Tu Chu-chai looked
hard at Wu Sun-fu, and there was a note of incredulity in his
voice.

Wu Sun-fu smiled and nodded.

“But that’s gambling, pure and simple! Now, Sun-fu! We're
in the stock-jobbing game to make a profit, and it’s too risky
to do things like that!”

Though he felt he had to turn the idea down bluntly like this,
Tu Chu-chai preserved his customary calm. Wu Sun-fu was
silent for a while, his eyes fixed upwards as if he was engaged
in some calculation or other. Suddenly he smacked the flat of
his hand on the corner of the table and said in an earnest voice:

“There’s no risk attached to it, Chu-chai; you can rest assured
of that. If you can let me have five hundred thousand dollars,
I’ll put the pressure on tomorrow, then prices will come down
again, and there’ll be a panic among the small investors. This,
coupled with the fresh advances that Chang Fa-kuei and Pai
Chung-hsi are bound to make on the Changsha front within the
next few days, will act as a sort of pincer movement, so to speak,
with the result that there'll be a rush to sell government issues,
and however hard he tries, Chao Po-tao won’t be able to stop
the rot! I tell you, Chu-chai, we wouldn’t be running any risk,
we'd be winning by means of a surprise attack!”

Tu Chu-chai closed his eyes and shook his head, but said noth-
ing. He remembered what Li Yu-ting had said about Wu Sun-
fu’s pig-headed independence, and decided he would have to
part company with him. He saw clearly that there was no talk-
ing him round. After a while he opened his eyes and answered
unhurriedly:

“Whether there’s any risk or not remains to be seen, but I
still can’t manage five hundred thousand. If you’re so set on it,
and you’re sure of pulling it off, you can always draw on the
four or five hundred thousand in the Yi Chung Trust Company.
I don’t see why you shouldn't take the whole lot for stock-
jobbing.”

“Nothing doing there, I’m afraid. All the money was allocated
to various uses at the board meeting the day before yesterday.
Chiu Chun has just brought me the contracts and I’ve already
signed them. We decided to take over the small factories, and
I’m afraid the company couldn’t spare what little money is left—
there’s hardly enough left to put the factories on their feet
again!”

As Wu Sun-fu spoke, his eyes gleamed with elation at the
thought that he had succeeded in buying out the factories on
extremely favourable terms. It was his first victory since his
trust company had come into being a short while ago—a highly

gratifying coup, in his opinion. Tu Chu-chai, on the other hand,
was none too happy about it. When he recalled how they argued
at the board meeting, he was exasperated and retorted bitterly:

“What did you expect? The company’s only just been
launched, and it’s crying out for capital already! If you must
go in for stock-jobbing, you'll have to drop the factories. And
anyway, to go throwing our capital into factories which have al-
ready gone broke once, and where you’ve no guarantee of suc-
cess—no, honestly, I just don’t see how it adds up—”

“Now, Chu-chai—” cried Wu Sun-fu, trying to interrupt Tu
Chu-chai’s tale of woe; but Tu Chu-chai brushed the interruption
firmly aside:

“Just let me finish! I haven’t forgotten what you and the
others said at the time. You all said that the factories had
failed because they were short of capital or because they had been
badly managed. You also said that they owed the company more
than a hundred thousand dollars before we took it over, and that
the old Yi Chung Company was being dragged down by this bad
debt. Then we went and bought over this bad debt from the
old Yi Chung Company for a mere forty per cent of its estimated
value—we got the best of the bargain there—so in actual fact
we bought out eight factories, valued at three hundred thousand
dollars, for a mere fifty or sixty thousand. Oh, yes, it looks a
bargain to get control of eight factories for an outlay of a mere
fifty thousand or so—at present—but then—”

Tu Chu-chai paused, and Wu Sun-fu burst out laughing. Still
laughing, he broke in, “So you think we'd lose by putting in
another five hundred thousand dollars, eh, Chu-chai? Well, if
we don’t, the first fifty thousand will have been thrown away. If
a horse has lost flesh, you have to feed it well before it’ll be
any use to you; in the same way, these factories have got to be
supplied with new capital if they’re going to bring in profits.
Besides, if we hadn’t spent that fifty thousand on taking over
these factories, the forty per cent that we paid for the bad debt
would have been thrown away as well!”

“So in order to retrieve the bad debt you propose to throw
in ten times as much again, eh? Seems to me you’re putting
too much spice into your bean-curd and making it cost as much
as meat.”

“Not on your life!” Wu Sun-fu retorted emphatically and some-
what irritably. He rose abruptly from his seat and paced up and
down, smiling grimly to himself. He had never expected that,
far from winning Tu Chu-chai round and persuading him to
finance his stock-~jobbing, he would make matters worse by an-
noying him with his transactions through the Yi Chung Trust
Company. As a matter of fact, ever since they had disagreed
at the company meeting over the purchase of the factories, he
had noticed that Tu Chu-chai seemed to be losing interest in
the future of the company, and he was beginning to fear that Tu
Chu-chai might decide to drop out or refuse to pay up when the
second instalment on the shares fell due. If that should happen,
it would be a serious blow to the company. It was no use try-
ing to interest Tu Chu-chai in anything which involved long-term
plans: all he was interested in was “get-rich-quick” schemes
which brought him profits tomorrow on today’s investments—
and even then he needed a lot of coaxing. The other day, when
the purchase of the factories was being discussed at the com-
pany meeting, Tu Chu-chai had hotly contested it until Wang
Ho-fu had said jokingly that buying these factories was like
buying second-hand goods cheap, an idea which appealed to Tu
Chu-chai. Wu Sun-fu now realized that if he was to hold Tu
Chu-chai, he must exploit this weakness of his. Once he had
Tu Chu-chai’s support he could at least negotiate loans with the
banks more easily. But first he must make sure of this man.
He continued to pace up and down, trying to think up some-
thing which would appeal to Tu Chu-chai. Presently, he smiled
and turned to his glum companion.

“Now, look, Chu-chai,” he said quietly, “there are two things
we've got to consider: the financing of the eight factories that the
company’s bought, and the one million bonds we sold out on the
third. It’s a case of ‘in for a penny, in for a pound,’ and the best
thing we can do is to put a bold face on it and do what we can.
It’s rather like pushing a wheelbarrow up a steep hill—you can’t
turn round, so you have to keep on. And that’s why I must
have five hundred thousand dollars more—to enable me to go on
bearing in the stock market, and to finance the company’s eight
factories.”

“No, it’s too risky for me,” Tu Chu-chai answered shortly,
shaking his head sadly.

So, for all his stirring speeches, Wu Sun-fu had failed to strike
even a spark of enthusiasm from Tu Chu-chai. Knitting his
brows, Wu Sun-fu pressed him further:

“Tf that’s your attitude, we may as well say goodbye to the
money we've put into the company!”

“No: we can still cut our losses and salvage something from
the wreck. Sorry, but my mind’s made up!”

An unusual note had crept into Tu Chu-chai’s voice, and his
face was set.

Wu Sun-fu’s heart sank. Nevertheless, he managed a careless
laugh as he took a step forward and patted Tu Chu-chai on
the shoulder.

“Come, now, Chu-chai!” he cried heartily. “Never say die!
Nobody wants you to speculate recklessly. We can always find
another way out. Now, you know there are certain fly individ-
uals in Shanghai who take a tumble-down house, redecorate
it and patch it up, and then let it for a nice fat sum of key-
money. If the worst comes to the worst, we can always fol-
low their example and do the same with the factories—though
of course in our case we do need to be more patient.”

“Don’t forget you’ve got to find a customer who’s willing to
take your reconditioned house!”

“Oh, there’ll be plenty of customers!” laughed Wu Sun-fu.
“If we can patch it up and decorate it so that it looks fairly
decent, there’s one man at least who'd be willing to pay a good
price: the great Chao Po-tao himself!”

He squared his shoulders and began pacing up and down the
study with confident strides.

Half-convinced, Tu Chu-chai sat watching Wu Sun-fu as he
paced to and fro. He said nothing, but his face betrayed a hint
of animation. He remembered Wu Sun-fu saying something about
Chao Po-tao forming a trust company, and was inclined to be-
lieve that Chao Po-tao might actually have something like that
up his sleeve; the fact that Chao Po-tao would not give way
over Chu Yin-chiu’s loan seemed to confirm the rumour. He
suddenly remembered that Chu Yin-chiu had just rung Wu Sun-
fu up—perhaps it was about the loan. He was just going to ask

Wu Sun-fu about it when the latter paced back, planted himself
in front of Tu Chu-chai, and began enthusiastically:

“Now about our speculation in government bonds: we may
have lost twenty thousand dollars or so to date, but there’s
twenty days and more to go before settlement day, and we’ve
plenty of time to turn our defeat into a victory. If we work it
the way I suggested just now we can’t go far wrong. If there
were any money left in the Yi Chung Trust Company, we could
do it through the company; I’m sure Wang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-
jen wouldn’t object to it. But as the company’s money’s already
tied up, it seems we'll have to do it on our own. Though of
course, our personal interests are closely bound up with those
of the company. The trouble is, what with one thing and an-
other, I haven’t much left to play with. Even Fei Little Beard’s
let me down, blast him! Tell you what, Chu-chai, let’s go halves
on raising this five hundred thousand! We can’t just sit back
and watch while Chao Po-tao rigs the market as he pleases!”

Again Tu Chu-chai closed his eyes and shook his head, but
said nothing. The more enthusiastic Wu Sun-fu became, the
less he felt like having a hand in it. He feared that the news
that changes were imminent in the Hankow area was simply
a piece of bluff on the part of Tang Yun-shan, and, what was
more to the point, he had not the courage to cross swords with
Chao Po-tao—he realized that Chao Po-tao knew too many tricks
and was much more ruthless than he was.

Well as he was acquainted with Tu Chu-chai’s character, Wu
Sun-fu was groping in the dark this time and had failed com-
pletely to see the working of his brother-in-law’s mind. He had
tried everything from persuasion to goading, but Tu Chu-chai
was adamant. The only response he could get was closed eyes
and a shake of the head—not even a word of refusal. Wu Sun-
fu’s patience was running out. Finally, however, Tu Chu-chai
said in a voice which implied that he was making a great con-
cession:

“Look, why not wait a day or two so that we can get a clearer
picture of the market before we do anything: we can’t rush
these things.”

“There’s no time to be lost!” Wu Sun-fu burst out impatiently,
and the pimples on his face turned an angry red. “Specula-

tion’s like fighting a battle—you must seize the bull by the horns,
and move fast! Especially when you’re up against an unpredict-
able devil like Chao Po-tao!”

Tu Chu-chai’s face was paling, and he felt as though his blood
was rushing to his heart and choking it to a stop. As a mat-
ter of fact, he was lending only half an ear to what Wu Sun-fu
was saying, for he was busy considering ways and means of pro-
tecting his own interests. His ideas were no more than a vague
outline at first, but gradually they became stronger and clearer,
until they converged into one single thought: he had two hundred
thousand dollars tied up in the Yi Chung Trust Company. He
had put this money into the company under the impression that
he was supplying some “floating capital” which was to be used
for investment in government bonds and for providing loans
against securities. He now realized that he was wrong, and that
he had been tricked into parting with his money. He had better
withdraw his capital while he could, before the company went
broke. Whatever the prospects of the eight factories, he was
determined to go while the going was good. It would probably
upset the others, but then you can’t please everybody!—And
then there’s Wu Sun-fu here still nattering on about government
bonds and the rest of it. Well, yes, admittedly, so far as today’s
closing prices went they had lost some twenty thousand
on government bonds, but, since the transaction had been in the
name of the Yi Chung Company, the loss would be stood by the
four of them—a mere five thousand dollars each; why,
he might easily have lost that much on eight rounds of mahjong
at the stakes he usually played for! ... Tu Chu-chai smiled
unconsciously to himself as he decided that it was far better to
say goodbye to his five thousand than to worry himself to death
day in day out over the fate of another hundred and ninety-five
thousand. Nevertheless, he could not find it in his heart to spring
this decision of his on Wu Sun-fu without warning: he ought
to break it gently to him, really. Slowly stroking his chin, he
gazed thoughtfully at the excited face of Wu Sun-fu.

Wu Sun-fu’s expression was rather frightening just now, and
he seemed torn by some inner conflict. He would probably have
looked worse if he had known what was going on in Tu Chu-
chai’s mind. As a matter of fact, far from suspecting the truth,

he was wondering how he could approach his sister—Tu Chu-
chai’s wife—and get her to instil a little courage into her hus-
band. What more could he do single-handed with a man who
sat there with his eyes closed, shaking his head and never say-
ing a word?

Suddenly, the man in question stood up, stretched, and broke
the silence of his own accord. “Sun-fu! If you’re quite set on
trying to outwit Chao Po-tao, just be careful you don’t come a
cropper in the process! I’ve known a lot of people trip up at
that game!”

Wu Sun-fu’s eyebrows shot up and he laughed. He imagined
that Tu Chu-chai was coming round to his point of view. After
a pause, the latter went on, “Another thing: when Li Yu-ting was
reporting back about his conversation with Chao Po-tao the other
day, he said something rather significant—”

“What was that?” Wu Sun-fu asked hastily, rising from his
seat and going across to Tu Chu-chai.

“When he said that Tang Yu-shan had political connections!
It’s true that Chao Po-tao has political connections himself, but,
Sun-fu, what’s the use of dragging ourselves into politics? Chao
Po-tao doesn’t want to let you have Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons,
and it’s more than likely that he’ll use this as an excuse to make
trouble for you—”

Tu Chu-chai paused again to fish out a handkerchief and mop
his forehead triumphantly. He thought the moment was now
ripe to break the news gently that he was finished with the Yi
Chung Trust Company, but before he could begin Wu Sun-fu
suddenly stamped his foot and laughed grimly.

“Don’t worry about that!—Oh, yes, Chu-chai, I forgot to tell
you: Chu Yin-chiu rang me up just now to tell me that he’s going
to sell me his cocoons and his factory as well!”

“Well I’m damned! But why?”

“I suppose Chao Po-tao’s heard that I’ve managed to get hold
of some cocoons, and realizes there’s no point in keeping Chu
Yin-chiu’s from me any longer, so he’s changed his tactics: he
knows I’m short of cash and he knows I’ve already got enough
cocoons, so he’s deliberately trying to push Chu Yin-chiu’s co-
coons on to me so as to leave me with no cash and more co-
coons than I need. In short, he’s doing everything he can pos-

sibly think of to get me in a tight corner. But I don’t think
he bargained for Chu Yin-chiu selling me his factory as well!”

Wu Sun-fu’s voice was calm as he said this, and he showed no
sign of vexation, for, though he was short of cash for the mo-
ment, his mind was still seething with ambitious plans for ex-
panding his business, and this served to soften the blow of all
his other misfortunes. Tu Chu-chai, on the other hand, looked
worried, for he was rather concerned on Wu Sun-fu’s account
and was more convinced than ever that Wu Sun-fu was playing
with fire pitting his wits against Chao Po-tao. His voice was
anxious as he asked, “Have you made up your mind to buy Chu
Yin-chiu’s factory, then?”

“I'l see tomorrow when I’ve had a talk with him—”

He broke off as the door opened and the butler, Kao Sheng,
showed in a visitor. It was Tang Yun-shan, and he looked dis-
traught: clearly, something serious had happened. Wu Sun-fu
and Tu Chu-chai were rather startled.

“Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi are retreating from Chang-
sha!”

Having delivered himself of this announcement, Tang Yun-
shan dropped on to a sofa and sat open-mouthed, scratching his
head.

There was a deathly silence in the room. Wu Sun-fu narrowed
his eyes and glanced from Tang Yun-shan to the day’s list of
opening and closing prices which lay on the table. Could the
military situation really be turning against him like this? It
was too fantastic! Tu Chu-chai let out a faint sigh: he was to-
talling up his probable losses—no longer five thousand dollars,
but ten, fifteen, even twenty thousand. He had just resigned
himself to losing five thousand, which he could do without too
much mental anguish, but now it looked as if he might have to
lose anything up to twenty thousand, which was quite another
matter!

After a moment or two, Wu Sun-fu grated through clenched
teeth, “Is this just a rumour, Yun-shan, or is it inside informa-
tion? Didn’t you tell me this morning that Chang Fa-kuei’s
Ironsides were marching east towards the Kiangsi border?”

“yes, but it now turns out that they’re actually retreating.
They kept away from the Wuchang-Changsha Railway so as to

avoid any unnecessary losses. Just after I phoned you this
morning, Huang Fen rang me up and told me about it—he’d
only just heard about it himself. I suppose he’d had a telegram
in code from his intelligence agent in Hankow. Ten to one the
information’s reliable.”

“Then if nobody else besides us knows about it, we can still
save the situation,” Wu Sun-fu muttered as if to himself, and
the wrinkles on his forehead relaxed slightly. Tu Chu-chai
heaved another sigh and resigned himself to a clear loss of twen-
ty thousand dollars. He swallowed and mechanically fished out
his snuff-box. Wu Sun-fu was rubbing his hands and staring
thoughtfully at the floor. Suddenly, he looked up and turned to
Tu Chu-chai:

“We must do what we can. Do you think there’s still a way
out, Chu-chai? Yun-shan’s news is a secret, and it’s real in-
side information. In all probability Changsha’s still in the hands
of the Kwangsi Army, and the movement of Chang Fa-kuei’s
Ironsides towards Kiangsi is sure to be taken by the public to
be a drive on Nanchang. We must strike while the iron’s hot
and get to work this very evening. You, Chu-chai, can put it
round among your banker friends that you’re going to demand
additional collaterals for all loans made on government bonds
as the only security. That’ll depress the market tomorrow morn-
ing, and then we’ll begin covering in separate lots—”

“TI guarantee Changsha will still be in our hands the day after
tomorrow!” interrupted Tang Yun-shan with great assurance,
laughing boisterously for no particular reason.

Tu Chu-chai nodded his head in silence. For the sake of his
twenty thousand dollars, he was warming once more to the affairs
of the Yi Chung Trust Company—he even forgot his snuff-box.
He glanced at his watch: it was ten to six; he could not afford
to lose a minute, so, pausing only to tell Wu Sun-fu to make the
necessary arrangements with the brokers, he hurried off. Left
alone, Wu Sun-fu and Tang Yun-shan turned to some other busi-
ness. Wu Sun-fu was the first to speak:

“Since the secret about the shipment has leaked out, I’m afraid
we can’t land it at Chefoo as the navy might intercept it off the
Shantung coast. I’ve just been thinking about it, and so far as
I can see the only way out is to nip down to Hongkong and try

to make arrangements on the spot to have the stuff shipped some-
where else.”

“Just what I was thinking. I’d better leave tomorrow. I hope
you can take over from me as general manager of the company
while I’m away.”

“Out of the question. You’d better ask Wang Ho-fu to do it.”

“Suppose I’ll have to. But—oh, I don’t know, the last fortnight’s
been just one setback after another. We've just fixed everything
up nicely with the odds and ends of local troops along the upper
Yangtse, and then at the last minute they go and change their
mind and let us down—they just stand by and watch. Result:
the armies under Chang Fa-kuei and Pai Chung-hsi are forced to
retreat when they’re within an ace of beating the Central Army.
Well, that wasn’t so serious: what’s worse is that the Shansi
Army hasn’t been putting everything they’ve got into it, while
the Northwestern Army has been really hard pushed for the last
month, with heavy casualties and ammunition running short.
And now even this little business of the arms shipment that we'd
got so well planned suddenly leaks out!”

Tang Yun-shan seemed to be in despair as he scratched his
head and looked first at Wu Sun-fu and then out of the window.
Behind the pavilion overlooking the pond the evening sky glowed
a deep red, and the trees around were splashed with gold.

Wu Sun-fu sat with bent head, his left hand on his hip and
his right describing circles on the desk. His expression gradual-
ly changed from one of contemptuous hauteur to one of gloomy
indecision. Presently, the gloom gave way to a flush of excite-
ment and he looked up abruptly.

“So the outlook is still a bit hazy, eh, Yun-shan? You don’t
think there’ll be any change in Shantung before the end of the
month, do you?”

“As things are now I daren’t say anything for certain,” replied
Tang Yun-shan miserably. “We'll just have to wait and see.
—Oh, it’s enough to make one give up!”

Wu Sun-fu broke into sudden, bitter laugh, then slumped back
in his revolving chair and closed his eyes. His face was ashen
now, and beads of sweat broke out on his temples. For the first
time in his life he felt utterly incapable and insignificant. His
business would run into heavy seas before long, and he would be

floundering helplessly—there was absolutely nothing he could do
about it!

After he had seen Tang Yun-shan off, he took a turn in the
garden. The last gleam had faded in the west, and night was
creeping out from among the shadowy trees. Lights blazed from
every window in the front of the house. As if repelled by the
glare, Wu Sun-fu made for the edge of the pond, where he sat
down in a cane-chair which happened to be left there, and heav-
ed a deep sigh.

He tried once more to take stock of his business. This was not
the first time he had faced wave upon wave of crises, and he had
always managed to weather the storm and afterwards hoist his
sails again and carry on, so that today he was all set for such
large-scale enterprise as he had never before attempted. He,
Sun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu shared the right to control eight
factories, all manufacturing household commodities. They had
also advanced new capital—over four hundred thousand dollars—
to develop these factories and increase the production of elec-
tric light bulbs, thermos flasks, parasols, soap and galoshes, mak-
ing these things available even to the most out-of-the-way village
in the country, and so dealing a fatal blow to the Japanese fac-
tories which had recently been transplanted in Shanghai! Apart
from all this, he was going to take over and run on his own ac-
count both Chen Chun-yi’s silk goods manufactory and Chu Yin-
chiu’s filature. He had achieved all this only after a bitter strug-
gle, and the struggle he would have to face to keep and increase
his gains would be no less bitter. Heavy seas were only to be
expected: “While the priest climbs a foot, the devil climbs ten!”
Was the way it went, but he and his partners were battle-scarred
veterans, so what had he to fear?

When he reached this point in his mental stock-taking, he
could not help smiling to himself. A cool evening breeze ruffled
his gown and he raised his head and looked about him, feeling
insignificant no longer and far from being helpless and alone.
He had noticed that among the old managers of the eight factories
they had taken over were several who would make useful as-
sistants: with training, they would make quite an efficient team
of executives. The only trouble was that there was a shortage of
clerical staff. He remembered his two relatives, Wu Wei-cheng

and Ma Ching-shan, who had been to him fora job that day. He
could probably find a use for them. Even though they would not
be a patch on Tu Wei-yueh, they would probably be miles bet-
ter than that old dodderer Mo Kan-cheng.

Suddenly he realized that someone was approaching, and a
breath of perfume came to his nostrils. He quickly turned his
head and recognized the tall, graceful figure that emerged from
the gloom as that of his wife.

“we've just had a telegram from Colonel Lei,” she said softly,
leaning on the back of his chair. There was a very slight shake
in her voice as she said this. “The funny thing is, it was sent
from Tientsin.”

“From Tientsin, eh? What does it say?”

“It says he’ll soon be finished up there and then he’ll be com-
ing back to Shanghai,” she replied in a strange voice, as if she
was happy and afraid at the same time; but her husband noticed
nothing. At the mention of Tientsin a swarm of doubts had as-
sailed his over-wrought mind. What could Colonel Lei be do-
ing in Tientsin? He was commanding a brigade on active service
—surely they couldn’t have fought their way right up to Tientsin?
If they had, then think of the effect the news would have on the
stock market tomorrow! His momentary optimism and elation
had deserted him now. He felt hot all over, and his wife’s per-
fume made him feel sick. He stood up and snapped at her:

“That’s some queer scent you’ve got on, Pei-yao!—Come on,
let’s go back in. Fu-fang still here?”

Without waiting for her answer, he walked off. All the way
back to the house his mind was seething with questions and
answers. Should he switch over to bulling? No, he couldn’t do
that if Tu Chu-chai wouldn’t fork out and help him, Should he
write off his eighty thousand dollars as a dead loss and give up
speculating in government bonds for good? No, he could not
very well do that: eighty thousand dollars was enough to start a
decent rubber goods factory. And besides, if he failed to get
the better of Chao Po-tao in the matter of government bonds,
his rival would be in a position to throw a spanner in the works
of the Yi Chung Company... .

He found his sister Fu-fang—Tu Chu-chai’s wife—chatting with
Wu Wei-cheng in the drawing-room. He went straight up to her
and said with a smile, “Can I have a word with you, Fu-fang?”

Fu-fang seemed taken aback for a moment. She glanced at
her son Hsin-to and Lin Pei-shan who were sitting side by side
at the piano and leafing through some scores, then nodded and
smiled. As he held open the door of the small drawing-room
for her, he turned to Wu Wei-cheng:

“You and Ma Ching-shan had better come down to the factory
tomorrow and when I see how you get on the first few days I'll
be able to decide what to do with you.”

“Oh, Sun-fu, there’s the young man from the Tsengs as well,”
hurriedly added Mrs. Wu, who had just that moment come into
the room. “He’s been waiting here a fortnight, you know.
Couldn’t you give him a try-out at the same time?” Wu Sun-fu
winced at the mention of Tseng Chia-chu, but nodded his head
all the same. He beckoned his wife aside and whispered in her
ear, “I want to get Fu-fang to talk Chu-chai into plucking up
courage and having another go at government bonds with me.
I want you to tell her that Colonel Lei’s been taken prisoner and
sent to Tientsin after losing a battle and getting wounded—Now,
make it sound as convincing as you can, and be careful you
don’t let the cat out of the bag!”

She was bewildered and could not make out what he meant.
For some reason she felt a pang of grief as the picture of a
wounded, captured Colonel Lei appeared before her. Wu Sun-
fu smiled and followed her into the next room, where his sister
was waiting. Just as he was about to close the door, he sud-
denly remembered something and put his head back round the
door to call out to the butler:

“Kao Sheng, ring up Mr. Lu Kuang-shih and ask him to pop
round before nine o'clock.”
XI

It was nine o'clock in the morning, and half a gale was howl-
ing along the Bund. At high tide during the night the level
of the Whangpoo had topped the landing-stages, and although
the river was beginning to drop now, the water was still rough
and choppy, and several black cones had been hoisted above the
towering meteorological observatory in Edward VII Road.

This was the opening attack of the season by one of the storms
with which Shanghai was favoured each summer.

A No. 1 tram running eastward towards the Bund to the end
of Nanking Road was battling with the powerful head-wind,
and its windows rattled noisily as if trembling with fear. It
finally came to a halt at the stop in front of the Cathay Hotel,
and a fashionably-dressed young woman got off. She ran straight
across the road as if driven forward by the wind and flew up
the stone steps in front of the hotel. At this moment a young
man in smart European dress, with a walking-stick hanging from
the crook of his arm, dashed out through the hotel entrance.
The skirt of the woman’s dress, which had very long side-slits,
flapped in the high wind, and as they passed it became entangled
with the young man’s walking-stick and the thin silk tore with
a pfft!

“Blast you!” the woman swore under her breath as she turned
to see who it was. A smile immediately appeared on her lips,
for the man was an acquaintance of hers: it was Han Meng-
hsiang, a stockbroker. The young woman herself, a beauty
a VPeuropéenne, was Liu Yu-ying, the widowed daughter-in-law
of Han Meng-hsiang’s colleague, Lu Kuang-shih.

“Hullo, you’re out early!” he said, smiling and giving her a
wink. “Not much fun for you leaving your warm bed and run-

ning into a gale like this!”

He stepped back to the side of the semi-circular steps and she
followed him, glaring at him with pretended indignation. Sud-
denly she smiled and said softly, “Now stop ragging, Meng-hsiang,
and tell me the number of Chao Po-tao’s room—I can’t remem-
ber it for the moment.”

A gust of wind raised the front flap of her dress so that it
wrapped itself round his leg and blew her long hair over her
eyes.

Han Meng-hsiang grunted and put up a hand to stop his
Panama hat being blown away. After a moment he sighed and
said, “What a wind!—It’s rising like government bonds! I sup-
pose you’ve bought ten or twenty thousand this time, haven’t
you, Yu-ying?”

“I haven’t the money—Now come on, do tell me the number
of his room.”

“If you really want to see him, it’s room number four—”

Just then a more violent gust still caught him full in the face,
and he quickly turned his back to the wind without finishing
what he was saying. Liu Yu-ying muttered a brief “Thank you,”
pushed her hair back and, hips a-sway, disappeared into the
hotel. He turned and watched her retreating figure with a smile,
then went slowly down the steps and across the road to look at
the North-China Daily News placard on the corner. “Reds
Threaten Hankow, Reported!” screamed the headlines, but Han
Meng-hsiang shrugged unconcernedly at the news. Glancing
back at the hotel entrance, he caught sight of Liu Yu-ying com-
ing out again with a look of mortification on her face. Pausing
at the top of the steps, she looked all round and seemed to have
spotted Han Meng-hsiang across the road, when suddenly a tram
pulled up at the stop, blotting them out from each other’s view.
When it moved off again, she ran across to him and, stamping
her foot, she exclaimed:

“You’re a fine one, Han Meng-hsiang!”

“Well, if you must dash off in such a hurry before I can finish
what I’m saying .. .” he replied with a sly grin, then turned away
down the street, swinging his stick, though he was careful not
to walk too fast. When she had recovered her temper, she strag-
gled behind him for a while, then caught up with him and
walked along beside him, though she did not speak. She was

sure that he knew where Chao Po-tao had gone, and she was
thinking of some way of worming the truth out of this sly young
fellow. The wind was blowing with a vengeance, damp and cold,
and Liu Yu-ying’s dress was of the flimsiest; she gradually edged
closer to him, until her long, perfumed hair was blowing against
his face and tickling his ear.

“But surely he went to the Great China Hotel,” he said, as
they were approaching the Custorns House Building. He turned
towards her as he spoke, and his leg brushed against hers.

“J waited there till daybreak but he didn’t turn up——” she be-
gan with a shake of her head, but just then a gust of wind took
her breath away and she broke off in the middle of what she
was saying. She turned her back to the wind and the flap of
her dress flew up to reveal a bare white thigh. She bit her lip
and shot the young man a coquettish smile, then exclaimed
peevishly:

“Oh, what a beast of a wind!”

“But I tell you it’s a ‘rising’ wind, so it’s a good omen for bulls
like Chao Po-tao!”

“Ts that so? Well, perhaps you can tell me where he spent the
night. I never forget a good turn, you know!”

“Oho! Let’s arrange it like this, then, Yu-ying! I'll go and find
out all about it, and then we'll meet again somewhere—”

“Shut up... .”

“Oh, I’m sorry if I’ve said more than I needed. I was forget-
ting you’re an old hand at the game. You naturally prefer to
give me your tacit consent. Am I right?”

“Oh, all right, then: now tell me!”

She rolled her eyes at him and smiled seductively. He hesi-
tated a moment and looked up at the patches of white cloud
scudding across the sky, then squared his shoulders as if he had
made up his mind and bent over to whisper something in Liv
Yu-ying’s ear. She immediately frowned and her eyes blazed
angrily. As she parted her lips in a mirthless smile, her even
white teeth were bared as if ready to bite. He shuddered in
spite of himself, for he had never imagined that a woman with
such a soft, creamy skin could look so ghastly when she was
angry! Almost immediately, however, her expression returned
to normal, and she pursed her lips into a smile. Just then an-

other fierce gust of wind threatened to sweep her off her feet,
and she grasped his arm for support.

“Thanks!” she exclaimed. “But I think I’ll go and see him
all the same.”

“Now don’t go upsetting yourself over it,” he urged her candidly
as he armed her along. “You’d best wait until he wants you and
asks for you, rather than go rushing in. I can tell, he can be
really nasty sometimes. When he doesn’t want you, he cuts you
dead. The only exception is Hsu Man-li, and he can’t afford to
ignore her!”

The wind was flercer than ever now, and its howling completely
drowned the roar of the city. Grey and white clouds raced
helter-skelter across the sky, and the wind blew damper and
chillier still. Yet Liu Yu-ying felt it was still not bracing enough,
and her thoughts raced faster than the clouds overhead. As
they reached Hankow Road she stopped dead and pulled her arm
out of his, then stepped back with a disarming smile, blew him
a kiss, and jumped into a rickshaw. Han Meng-hsiang stood
rooted to the ground, gaping after her receding figure.

The words “Ring you later!” and a tinkling laugh came back
to him on the wind.

*

Half an hour later, Liu Yu-ying found herself embarking on
a little adventure in a five-storeyed building in Avenue Joffre.
She wrote the name “Hsu Man-li” on a slip of paper and gave it
to a page. As she followed him up to the room, she went over
once more in her mind the three sets of tactics she had worked
out for her coming encounter with Chao Po-tao.

The door opened, and she slipped in, smiling, but was taken
aback when she found that Chao Po-tao’s companion was not a
woman at all: it was his crony Shang Chung-li! She immediately
decided that none of her carefully-planned tactics would be of
any use now. His face dark with anger, Chao Po-tao leapt to
his feet and barked:

“So it’s you! Who sent you here?”

“Hsu Man-li,” she said, on the spur of the moment. She was
beginning to fear that she was going to fail in her adventure this
time. But, not forgetting she still had her “woman’s armoury,”
she put on her brightest smile, greeted Shang Chung-li and sat

down with her back to the window. She was sitting in a strong
draught, but she was too busy to notice it—closely watching Chao
Po-tao’s face, calming her own mind, and working out a new
plan of attack.

“Nonsense!” snorted Chao Po-tao, shrugging his shoulders and
smiling sardonically. “Hsu Man-li doesn’t know I’m here—
unless she’s got second sight! You must have wheedled it out
of young Han Meng-hsiang!”

So her bluff was called, just like that, Her heart was pound-
ing, but suddenly she guessed that he had not seen Hsu Man-li
during the last few days. It was worth the risk to tell another
lie to cover up the first one—and she was a skilful liar, too. In
no time at all she had concocted her story—based on what Han
Meng-hsiang had told her about Chao Po-tao’s relations with
Hsu Man-li and on other scraps of hearsay she had picked up
about her. Her smile vanished, and she assumed a look of in-
jured innocence.

“Now that’s hardly fair: you’ve got it all wrong! Asa matter
of fact, I came here of my own accord but it was from Hsu Man-
li that I found out where you were. I waited for you last night
in the Great China Hotel, but you didn’t come and I was feeling
fed up, so I went into the ballroom to have a look round, and
there she was; but she didn’t recognize me. She was muttering
away to some man, and I happened to overhear what she was
saying—nobody else would have guessed who it was she was
talking about, but I knew straight away it was you she meant.
She—she—”

She stopped, not knowing quite how to go on. As luck would
have it, a gust of wind blew her hair over her eyes; seizing
her opportunity, she stood up and closed the window, and so was
able to disguise her hesitation.

“Did she tell him I was staying here?” Chao Po-tao asked im-
patiently.

“Yes, she told him that you were staying here and that you
had some new dodge up your sleeve—”

“Eh! Do you know who the man was?” Chao Po-tao inter-
rupted, wide-eyed. “What does he look like?”

Something in his look told her that he was not only anxious
to know who the man was, but also that he had made a con-

fident guess about his identity already. She had hardly expected
this, and her heart began pounding again. She frowned and put
her head on one side, then suddenly smiled and said, “Oh, I
think he must be a friend of yours! He’s not all that tall, and
not particularly good-looking ...I think I’ve met him some-
where before.”

Chao Po-tao winced and looked significantly at Shang Chung-
li, who pulled at his beard and smiled.

Liu Yu-ying felt suddenly hot. She stood up and opened the
window again, then remained standing there, looking out. A
gust of wind struck her in the face, carrying with it a tiny leaf.
The trees lining the street were swaying drunkenly, and the wind
seemed to be blowing as hard as ever.

“It must be Wu Sun-fu!l’ Chao Po-tao muttered to Shang
Chung-li, bringing the flat of his hand down with an agitated
thwack on the arm of the sofa. ‘Damn it, she’s gone and hooked
him too!”

“Wu Sun-fu?” Yes, she knew who that was. So she really
had met him, after all. She remembered her father-in-law, Lu
Kuang-shih, mentioning Wu Sun-fu just recently in connection
with some political party or other. She also remembered Han
Meng-hsiang dropping a remark about Wu Sun-fu and Chao Po-
tao falling out over something. She was so overjoyed that she
nearly burst out laughing. Her makeshift lie had done the trick,
and she now felt perfectly at ease. She decided she would em-
broider her masterpiece of deception still further. She was ready
to lie the devil out of countenance today!

“I expected something like this all along,” replied Shang
Chung-li in an undertone, slowly stroking his beard and shooting
Liu Yu-ying an appraising glance. ‘“‘That’s why I advised you
to keep a firm grip on Hsu Man-li.”

Chao Po-tao turned to Liu Yu-ying again and asked icily,
“What else were they talking about?”

“Well, I didn’t understand a lot of it, so I can’t really re-
member, but it seemed to be something about the stock market
and that sort of thing. And then I heard the word ‘gun’—I sup-
pose they meant that somebody ought to be shot—and then the
man pulled a face and made a gesture as if—”

She had got as far as this with her fairy-tale, and was feeling
quite pleased with herself, when Chao Po-tao suddenly threw
back his head and roared with laughter, while Shang Chung-li
narrowed his eyes at her and shook his head. Didn’t they
believe her, then? Her heart began pounding again. Chao Po-
tao’s laughter subsided, and his face became quite stern. Sud-
denly he sprang to his feet, clapped her sharply on the shoulder,
and cried:

“yu-ying, your heart’s in the right place! You've told us quite
enough! Now, there’s somebody in the other room, an acquain-
tance of yours. You can go and keep her company for a while!”

As he spoke, he waved towards the door on the left, then
grasped her by the arm, shoved her into the room, and closed the
door behind her.

She found herself in a luxuriously-furnished bedroom with
French windows opening on to a baleony. A double bed occupied
the centre of the room, with one end against the wall and the
other towards the windows. On the bed lay a woman in a white
silk night-dress, her face to the other side of the room. Liu Yu-
ying just stood there in a trance, wondering what it had all
meant: why had Chao Po-tao suddenly burst out laughing like
that, and then shoved her into this room? She could not make
up her mind for the moment whether it was a good sign or a
bad one. She strained her ears to hear what was going on in
the next room: not a sound! She peeped through the keyhole
and saw that Chao Po-tao was smoking a cigar, while Shang
Chung-li was stroking his beard.

One of the French windows was open, and the wind was blow-
ing in in intermittent gusts. Now and then the woman’s silk
night-dress puffed up like a soft, translucent shell, and her newly-
waved hair fluttered on the pillow. Yet the woman slept on.
Feeling calmer now, Liu Yu-ying tiptoed across to the bed; when
she saw who it was she all but shrieked with surprise. Who
should it be but her bosom friend Feng Mei-ching! So it was
this little girl of sixteen or seventeen who had been the cause
of her waiting all night in vain for Chao Po-tao at the Great
China Hotel! Although Liu Yu-ying had often told herself that,
so long as she could tap him for money from time to time, she
could not care less how many girls Chao Po-tao picked up to

sleep witn, nevertheless, just at this moment, she was consumed
with jealousy, and had half a mind to wake Feng Mei-ching up
and ask her what the devil she thought she was doing. It was
at that moment that the girl woke up of her own accord. She
rubbed her eyes, turned on to her back, and languidly raised her
legs, so that her night-dress slipped down to her waist, leaving
her thighs unashamedly bare.

Liu Yu-ying smiled to herself and slipped out on to the balcony.
She was thinking of playing a joke on Feng Mei-ching, just to
get her own back, but she suddenly caught a snatch of conversa-
tion, and the voice was Chao Po-tao’s:

“You’re quite right: the ‘guns’ they were talking about must
mean the shipment of arms. Oh, hell! It was just my bad luck
that Hsu Man-li should still have been hanging about at my place
the day that German came to see me; I forgot for the moment
that she knew a few words of English....”

“Cherchez la femme,” came Shang Chung-li’s voice. “Your
trouble is, you’re too fond of ’em—you’ve got two here this very
minute!”

When Liu Yu-ying heard this, she swore under her breath:
“Oh, go to hell, you old—!” Then she heard a roar of laughter
from Chao Po-tao.

“It doesn’t look as if we can trust that German. He’s prob-
ably buttering his bread on both sides. He gets fifty thousand
dollars from us and then goes and blabs to Wu Sun-fu!”

“Blast him! The bribe is a small matter— we could get it
back if it came to that. The point is, our reputation’s at stake!
If we let our people down this time, they’ll never trust us again.
We must stop the shipment falling into their hands at all costs!”

“Well, what about taking the matter up with the broker?. . .”

Suddenly a plane-tree in front of the balcony rustled in the
wind, so that it was impossible to hear any more of the con-
versation. The wind, which slackened off some time since, now
suddenly rose again. Liu Yu-ying was standing with her face
to the east, and was forced to close her eyes, so strong was the
wind. A sudden bang startled her as the window blew to and
immediately swung open again. She looked round to find that
Feng Mei-ching had raised her head and was staring in wide-
eyed amazement. The two women’s eyes met for a second, then

looked away again. Feng Mel-ching blushed but Liu Yu-ying
bit her lip and smiled.

“What are you doing here, Yu-ying?” asked the embarrassed
Feng Mei-ching, clambering off the bed and shaking down her
night-dress. She joined Liu Yu-ying on the balcony, where the
wind first made her full-bottomed night-dress belly out, then
whisked it up to reveal her plump white buttocks. Liu Yu-ying
tittered and exclaimed:

“Mei-ching! Somebody down in the street is looking up at you

“Where’s Fatty? Oh, bother the wind! Looks like rain. Have
you been to my place, Yu-ying? And what are you doing here?”

While she rambled on like this, she held down her night-dress
with her hand, and her eyes never left Liu Yu-ying’s face. The
look in her eyes was a mixture of apprehension, disgust, shame
and jealousy. But Liu Yu-ying paid no attention whatsoever to
all this, for she was too busy eavesdropping on the conversation
going on in the next room. A moment ago she had happened to
catch a phrase or two which had aroused her curiosity, and which
made her realize suddenly why Chao Po-tao could not afford to
slight Hsu Man-li.

“Oh, bother the wind!” she muttered as if to herself, instead of
answering Feng Mei-ching’s string of questions. She frowned
and strained her ears, but she could only catch a few blurred,
disjointed words of which she could make neither head nor tail.
Nothing could be heard clearly above the noise of the wind, and
she imagined that the wind was blowing all sound of the con-
versation next door away in the opposite direction. She heaved
a sigh of disappointment.

“Who are you so angry with, Yu-ying? I haven’t done any-
thing to you—”

Feng Mei-ching seemed unable to contain herself any longer.
Her face was pale and she was looking daggers at Liu Yu-ying.
Liu Yu-ying had not expected this; it made her blood boil, and
she flushed to the tips of her ears. She was on the verge of
flaring up, but thought better of it and beat her anger back, then
took Feng Mei-ching’s hand gently in hers and said with a smile:

“well, well! It’s only a few days since I saw you last, but
you've changed completely! You’re more sure of yourself—no
one could help noticing the difference. I came today to offer

?

you my congratulations, so how could I possibly be angry with
you?”

At this Feng Mei-ching crimsoned and jerked her hand out of
Liu Yu-ying’s grip. Without a word, she ran back into the room
and flung herself on the bed. Liu Yu-ying smiled with satisfac-
tion, and was just going to go back into the room again, when
suddenly Chao Po-tao’s voice could be heard once more; this
time it was loud and excited, ringing with optimism and con-
Adence.

“Just you wait and see! Wu Sun-fu is overreaching himself
this time, and he’ll soon find himself in hot water! Any Chinese
who runs industrial enterprises without foreign capital behind
him is doomed to failure. And then look at the way he speculates
in government bonds: huh! This month he started off as a
bear; then, when he saw that the situation in Changsha was
quite peaceful, he changed over to bulling, and at the moment
he’s probably holding six or seven million. If my guess is cor-
rect, he’s got a tidy lot of futures booked for delivery next month.
What he’s banking on is that the Shansi Army won't start any
large-scale operations, and that there won’t be any major battles
on the Tientsin-Pukow line, until about the tenth of next month,
ha ha! Wu Sun-fu’s very shrewd in his calculations, but, un-
fortunately for him, Chao Po-tao is going to have a bit of fun
at his expense! I’ll wait until he’s got halfway up the hill, and
then I'll pull him down by his leg!”

After a moment’s silence there was a rapid exchange of ques-
tions and answers, and the two men’s voices were so jumbled
together that Liu Yu-ying could make nothing of it. She stood
lost in thought, wondering just how Chao Po-tao proposed to
“pull Wu Sun-fu down by his leg”; anyway, she wasn’t really
interested when they just talked shop: she was just listening in
case there should be any more interesting bits about Hsu Man-
li. Meanwhile, Feng Mei-ching was giving Liu Yu-ying ven-
omous looks and working off her feelings by biting the corner of
her handkerchief. Liu Yu-ying smiled and deliberately turned
her back on her as if she were put out. Just then she heard
Shang Chung-li’s voice again:

“So you’ve decided to fight it out with them, eh?... How
much are you going to get rid of?”

“tt all depends. As the prices go up, I’ll unload, and lll con-
tinue unloading until Wu Sun-fu collapses and the Yi Chung
Trust Company folds up! And what’s more, Chung-li, I had the
tip-off some time ago that a strategic withdrawal has been
planned from the northern section of the Tientsin-Pukow lne—
it'll only be a matter of time. Today’s the seventeenth, and
there’s still ten days to go before the settlement. If our plan
hasn’t been successful by then, and Wu Sun-fu looks like getting
the better of us, we can always resort to the old method which
proved so effective last month, can’t we? . . 2

Then came roars of laughter which seemed to come nearer
and nearer, until Chao Po-tao’s head suddenly popped out of the
window of the next room. Fortunately for Liu Yu-ying, he
looked straight down at the street. She started with surprise
and slipped back hastily into the room. She bounded across the
room and sat down on the bed beside Feng Mei-ching with her
hand pressed against her chest.

Feng Mei-ching angrily straightened her legs and rolled over
so that she put a foot or so between Liu Yu-ying and herself,
as if her friend were covered with prickles.

“Oh, don’t be so childish, Mei-ching!” smiled Liu Yu-ying,
who had now recovered her composure. “What's it all about,
eh? Like good sisters, we should bare our hearts to each other.”

She sat staring at Feng Mei-ching’s back as she spoke, but
her attention was otherwise engaged: she was turning over and
over in her mind the scraps of conversation which she had just
overheard. Of course, she was perfectly well aware what Feng
Mei-ching was cross about, but she had not the time to bother
herself with her petty jealousies. Encouraged by the unexpected
progress she had made in the course of her “adventure,” she
was now busy planning how best she might become a second Hsu
Man-li and then get Chao Po-tao under her thumb even more
skilfully than Hsu Man-li herself had done. As she racked her
brains, she reached out and rolled Feng Mei-ching over again.

“Now listen, Mei-ching, you must believe what I say,” she
urged. “I didn’t come here to pick a quarrel with you, and I
didn’t come to talk to Chao Po-tao. I happened to be passing
by and I just popped in to see you. You must know by now what
I’m really like: ever since my husband died, I’ve had no heart

for anything, and I just go on from day to day enjoying myself
when I can. I don’t want to fight anybody. We’re good friends,
and all I want to do is to help you. You don’t imagine I came to
spoil your little game?”

“All right, then, tell me the truth: did Fatty ask you to come
here?”

“No; I came here for something else,” Liu Yu-ying answered
offhandedly, and smiled. She was trying to make up her mind
whether to leave without more ado, or whether to wait until
she had a chance to tell Chao Po-tao some more lies.

“Fatty in the next room?” asked Feng Mei-ching. She smiled
and gazed into Liu Yu-ying’s face, waiting for an answer, her
eyes betraying a childish naivety, that was quite ludicrous.

“He’s out there with a visitor—surely you knew?” Liu Yu-
ying replied quietly, resting her chin on Feng Mei-ching’s shoulder.
She was still trying to make up her mind what to do. Feng Mei-
ching shook her head without a word and smiled languidly. Now
that she had got over her jealousy, her head was beginning to
feel heavy and her limbs weak. She had rather overdone it dur-
ing the night.

For a while there was silence in the room, broken only by the
whistling and moaning of the wind outside the windows.

“Well, I must be off now, Mei-ching. Fatty’s still busy with
his visitor. Come to the pictures with me tomorrow.”

As she said this, Liu Yu-ying opened the door and slipped into
the other room. Her plans were laid. To her surprise, she found
Shang Chung-li sitting there alone with a cigar in his mouth,
lost in thought. Their eyes met, but the old man just stroked
his beard and smiled vaguely as if only half aware of her. Liu
Yu-ying decided she would have to abandon her plan. Glancing
at Shang Chung-li and pointing towards the door of the bedroom,
she tittered and went out.

When she reached the street, she went into a shop to ring
for a taxi. She was going to see Han Meng-hsiang and make
sure she had him under her thumb before she did anything
else. In a few moments she was sitting in the car, which battled
forward against the howling gale, and as she sat there the thoughts
raced through her head faster than the wind outside. She bit
her lip and smiled as she thought: “Chao Po-tao, my lad, if

you don’t agree to my terms, all right: then we part company
for good. Wu Sun-fu would be only too glad to pay me a good
price for that little secret of yours! Well, whoever pays me a
fair price can have it!”

*

Liu Yu-ying was a clever girl. She had been to school for
several years until she was seventeen, and she knew more
Chinese than her friend Feng Mei-ching. She had had a thorough
grounding in all the intricacies of stock exchange business and
was quite at home in it. About ten years before, her father had
gone bankrupt and committed suicide after a great upheaval
on the Exchange. Her brother had made a living on the merry-
go-round of get-rich-quick gambles and moonlight flits until last
year, when he had lost heavily on his speculations in gold bars
and had then received a prison sentence for embezzlement; he
was still in prison at that time. Her father-in-law, Lu Kuang-
shih, and her late husband had talked of nothing else but gold
bars and government bonds every time they opened their mouths.
She herself had lately come to use the floor of the Exchange
as her “home” during the day, and there, guided by some sixth
sense, she would buy or sell anything up to ten thousand at a
time, though she always took great care not to involve herself
too deeply. She had learned a lesson from the failures of her
father, her brother, her father-in-law and her husband, and pre-
ferred to play safe and be satisfied with making of fifty or sixty
dollars on ten thousand government bonds.

Being a woman, she realized that men and women had different
ways of making money: men used money as capital, whereas
women used themselves as capital. This was why, although she
played safe where government ponds were concerned, she was
prepared to gamble recklessly in her relations with Chao Po-tao.
When, a month or so ago, she had first got to know him through
Han Meng-hsiang, she had decided at once that he was just
another kind of “speculation.” And out of this speculation she
was expecting to make quite a packet!

And now her “harvest” was ready for reaping. Every nerve
in her body was tensed, and her brain piled up one plan after
another, one cunning move after another. When she reached

the Exchange, she thought to herself: “It might be a good idea
to sell my secret retail. For the last month everybody here has
been snooping around trying to find out the secret of Chao Po-
tao’s success!” She had employed her wits to analyse and sift
everything she had overheard and had come to the conclusion
that the “shipment of munitions” and “the German” would be of
interest only to Wu Sun-fu. So far as speculation in government
bonds was concerned, she concluded that Chao Po-tao was not
only intending to turn bear, but also had up his sleeve what
he called “the old method,” which guaranteed him success every
time. She was not very clear what this “old method” was, but
she firmly believed that Chao Po-tao had a whole bag of tricks
at his disposal and could do what he said.

The floor of the Stock Exchange was even more crowded and
noisy than a busy market-place. The air was suffocating and
reeked of sweat. Unable to squeeze through the crowd to the
front, Liu Yu-ying craned her neck above the sea of heads until
she caught sight of Han Meng-hsiang’s glossy black head of hair,
but he was too far away for her to be able to attract his attention.
Up on the platform the announcer and the telephonists were all
red in the face as they gesticulated and shouted, but it was im-
possible to hear a word they were saying. Seventy or eighty
brokers, together with their hundred-odd assistants and innu-
merable speculators, produced between them such a deafening
pandemonium of shouting and bidding that no ordinary ear could
have made anything of it.

When “Reorganization and Disbandment for This Month” was
posted on the board above the platform, an even louder and
longer roar of figures thundered through the Exchange, and the
sea of excited faces surged right and left as they fought to get
to the front. Unable to keep even the place she had got, Liu
Yu-ying was forced back to the door. After a pause for breath,
she returned to the attack and eventually managed to fight her
way through the crowd and get a seat on the benches between
the entrance and the exit, against the wall where the Exchange
notices and lists of brokers’ names and numbers were posted
up. This was a sort of “rear hospital” where those who had been
put hors de combat at the front came to sit and pant. Here it
was impossible to see even the head of the announcer on the

platform, though one could just see his hand held up in the
distance.

When Liu Yu-ying looked down and saw that her dress of
pale blue gauze was soaked with sweat and that her nipples
showed through as two round, rosy blurs, she could not help
smiling. How comical it all was, she thought: here in the
Exchange was the “madding crowd,” while somewhere outside
away from it all Chao Po-tao and Wu Sun-fu were lounging on
their sofas with their cigars and pulling the strings that made
these puppets dance! As for herself, she now held the secrets
of the two string-pullers in the palm of her hand. All these
men here were fighting in the dark, and she alone knew what
was going on: what an immense joke it all was!

She wriggled her hips and twisted her lips into a smile.
How little did the men sitting around her realize what a fabulous
secret she had! Red-faced, their bloodshot eyes staring, they
sat there jabbering and arguing, while the veins stood out like
cords on their temples. The odd one or two sat alone, their
heads bent in silence; you knew at once that they had fought
and lost. Their lack-lustre eyes stared hopelessly into a wretched
future as they contemplated selling their property, or abscond-
ing, leaving their debts unpaid.

On a bench opposite Liu Yu-ying two men, one with a droop-
ing moustache and the other with a toothbrush moustache, were
conversing in conspiratorial whispers. She recognized the first as
Feng Mei-ching’s father, Feng Yun-ching. The old man’s blotchy
face wore a hang-dog look as he listened in silence to his com-
panion whispering on and on. Suddenly, a round-faced man in
his forties squeezed his way out of the crowd and staggered into
the “rear hospital” area. He rushed up to Feng Yun-ching and
yelled:

“yun-ching, Yun-ching! They’re going up now! Ten cents,
fifteen cents, twenty cents! A steady rise! How about it? Shall
we buy in ten thousand?”

“Ha ha ha!’ Feng Yun-ching’s companion chimed in. “ ‘Buy,’
he says! I’m for selling out twenty or thirty thousand, myself!”

He stood up with the intention of squeezing his way through
to the “front” again. He was in his thirties and had a fashionable
toothbrush moustache, and his face seemed familiar to Liu Yu-

ying. While Feng Yun-ching was hesitating what to do, the
round-faced man squeezed back into the crowd and craned his
neck to see the quotations flashing out one after another on the
board in the distance. The man with a toothbrush moustache
urged Feng Yun-ching:

“Well, now, what about selling out twenty thousand? The
prices have been rising steadily for three days now—they must
turn and come down again soon!”

“Oh dear! You say they’re going to drop, and Shen-an says
they’re going to keep rising. I think I’ll give them another day
and see what happens then.”

Feng Yun-ching’s face was flushed as he hastily made this
reply. Now the raund-faced was squeezing his way back again,
his mouth awry.

“They’re falling again!” he shouted. “They’re back to the open-
ing price again!”

Immediately, the man with the toothbrush moustache snorted
with exasperation, sprang to his feet and fought his way fran-
tically into the crowd. Feng Yun-ching sat speechless, his eyes
staring. The round-faced man edged up to him and panted,
“It’s a queer go, Yun-ching! It looks as if two strong groups
of bulls and bears are fighting tooth and nail!”

“You're telling me! That’s why I prefer to wait and see for
a while. But you know, Shen-an, Chuang-fei’s been complaining
that I didn’t have the courage to sell short on the fourth. Now
he’s even more annoyed that I won’t unload a few. He says
I’m making a big mistake. ... As a matter of fact, since we
three are in it together, I’m ready to do what the majority want.
If you and Chuang-fei are agreed, there’s nothing I can say!”

“Oh, no, it’s not like that at all!” protested the man they
called Shen-an, knitting his brows and sitting down in the empty
space beside Feng Yun-ching. “Since the prices keep fluctuating
like this, I agree with you that it would be better to wait and
see,”

Having heard and understood all that passed between them,
Liu Yu-ying could not help smiling again. She looked down
at the hollow of her palm, in which she seemed to be holding
the fate of three men with three different hearts but bound
together in a common endeavour. But no, they were not the

only three! She held in the palm of her hand the fates of every
one of these men who were sweating and fighting over “Reor-
ganization and Disbandment” in a seething mass before her!
She stood up impulsively, moved unselfconsciously across to
Feng Yun-ching, and greeted him in a crystal-clear voice.

“Good morning, Mr. Feng! How’s your luck today?”

“Ah! Miss Liu!—Ah, I knew there was something I wanted
to ask you: have you seen Mei-ching about? The day before
yesterday she—”

“Ah, I’M tell you all about it later on,” replied Liu Yu-ying
with a winning smile, casually flashing a sideway glance at
Ho Shen-an. “The market’s gone mad today, hasn’t it? I hope
you're not going to miss this chance of making a fortune, Mr.
Feng!”

All of a sudden, an uproar arose in the centre of the scrimmage
—not an ordinary one following a new quotation, but a deafening
roar that rose above the usual hubbub. Immediately, those at
the “front” surged backwards like a tidal wave, while many in
the tightly crowded “rear hospital” sprang to their feet and tried
to make their way forward and some stood on the benches to
see what was happening. Feng Yun-ching and Ho Shen-an were
scared to death.

“The barrier’s given way!” shouted someone up in the gallery
above the platform, cupping his hands around his mouth and
leaning out over the balustrade. “Keep calm, there’s nothing to
worry about! It’s only the barrier collapsed!”

“Oh, they’re off their heads—it’s worse than a battlefield!”
sighed Liu Yu-ying. She laid her hand on her chest, and found
that her gauze dress, which had half dried out while she had
been sitting there, had suddenly become wet through with per-
spiration again. The panic soon passed and the Exchange resumed
its normal round of struggle and turmoil, with every man fighting
desperately to snatch a victory before the close of the session.
Ho Shen-an turned to Liu Yu-ying and said with a smile:

“I’m sure I’ve met you before, Miss Liu. Do you come here
often? Are you expecting a rise or a drop? I think it’s going
to be a rise.”

“And some people are expecting a slump! But tell me,
Mr. Feng, how much are you in for? All going well, I hope?”

“Ch, nothing big, nothing big. There’s three of us in it—just
two hundred thousand dollars or so between us. At the moment
we're neither gaining nor losing anything. We're waiting to see
which way things go in the next ten days.”

“Are you buying?”

“Surely. Mr, Feng thinks that for the last six months the
bears have been out of luck, and I must say I agree with him.
When we had that big drop around the middle of last month,
everybody thought that government issues were heading for a
slump, so it came as a great surprise when the prices shot up
again at the end of the month.—I say, Miss Liu, have you heard
about that fellow Chao Po-tao? He’s never made a mistake yet,
and they say he’s buying again this time!”

Ho Shen-an lowered his voice to a whisper as he said this,
and stretched out his neck and put his mouth to Liu Yu-ying’s
ear—perhaps because he thought it was a secret, or perhaps
because she was so attractive and he could not resist doing it.
All this left her quite unmoved, but she glanced sideways at
him and acknowledged the tip with a smile. She suddenly
remembered her plan for “selling her secret retail.” Here was an
opportunity, so why shouldn’t she try it out? After all, Feng
Yun-ching was not a stranger. She decided to drop a hint straight
away.

“Yes, that’s quite right. But I’ve heard something else—”

“Er, Miss Liu, what about Mei-ching?” interrupted Feng Yun-
ching just at the crucial moment. His dark face flushed slightly,
and Liu Yu-ying noticed it at once. An idea suddenly struck
her. She tugged at his sleeve and whispered in his ear:

“Didn’t you know? She’s busy with some little scheme or other!
I met her at Chao Po-tao’s place only a short while ago. It looks
as if he’s making a pot of money again this month—several
hundred thousand dollars, I expect! I know him, he—oh, Mr.
Feng, you didn’t say you were buying, did you? oh dear—”

She suddenly stopped and turned to smile at him. She had
said as much as she dared, and the hint was as plain as a hint
could be, but Feng Yun-ching just sat there, flushed and silent,
with not a glimmer of response in his eyes. When he heard that
his daughter was actually at Chao Po-tao’s, his mind had been
plunged into an absolute turmoil: his hopes of her success, his

sense of shame, which had not yet been completely crushed, and
his fear that the prize might slip from his grasp—all these emo-
tions made a simultaneous impact on his mind at that moment,
and he had just not taken in the rest of what Liu Yu-ying had
said.

“Now I want you to get this straight, Mr. Feng,” she said,
still in a whisper. She had decided to stop beating about the
bush, and to come directly to the point. “Liu Yu-ying has never
yet been known to double-cross anybody, and I don’t ask much:
a very small reward will do the trick!”

This time he heard every word, but, having lost the thread
of what she was saying, he had no idea what she meant and just
sat staring at her blankly. Just then, their conversation was
interrupted.

A sudden change had taken place on the floor of the Exchange.
The hubbub of business transactions, a deafening roar of voices
consisting almost wholly of shouted figures—such as five thousand,
ten thousand, fifty thousand, a hundred thousand, or it might
be ten cents, fifteen cents, one dollar—had given way to the sort
of babel of voices, interspersed with roars of laughter and sighs,
that one hears in a theatre. Those at the “front” drifted away,
and some left the floor altogether. Trading in “Reorganization
and Disbandment” had closed with a rise of half a dollar.

“The Seventh-Year Long Term” appeared on the board above
the platform. This old government loan was followed by others
issued by the former régime in Peking, none of them attracting
much interest from speculators or forming the main line of
business of the Exchange. The warlike “thunder of figures” had
abated and quite a number of people had left. Li Chuang-fei,
the man with a toothbrush moustache, now hurried elatedly
back, his face bathed in sweat. He glanced at Ho Shen-an, slapped
Feng Yun-ching on the back, and bellowed:

“The closing price was half a dollar up! Whatever you say
about it, I’ve got rid of ten thousand!”

“Good heavens, man! What on earth possessed you to do that?”
shrieked Ho Shen-an, leaping to his feet. One would have
thought Li Chuang-fei had just sliced a hunk of flesh off him.
Feng Yun-ching said nothing but just sat staring blankly.

“What's the matter with that? You know me: all straight and
above-board! If it goes up again, I’ stand the loss. If it drops,
will you pay the difference?”

“That's all right by me, but what are we going by: tomorrow’s
closing price or the last price before the settlement?”

Ho Shen-an and Li Chuang-fei threw themselves into a heated
argument. Feng Yun-ching was still engrossed in his own wor-
ries. He had decided on his plan of campaign; once he had
questioned his daughter and discovered Chao Po-tao’s secret,
he would know just how to proceed. When that time came,
apart from the joint buying out of the pool of two hundred
thousand dollars, he was going to launch out on his own without
Jetting on to his two partners.

Liu Yu-ying had been listening in to Ho Shen-an and Li
Chuang-fei with a deal of amusement.

“Now, Chuang-fei! Surely you don’t believe all these so-called
stop-press reports? They’re rumours pure and simple! All these
clerks and assistants that you keep in your hotel, now they’re
the sort of people who write these reports! You just show me
any one of their telegrams that they didn’t cook up out of their
own heads! How can you be so certain that the market’s going
bearish?”

“It’s no good arguing with you. Time will tell who’s right.”

Li Chuang-fei’s voice betrayed a slight uncertainty. Ho Shen-
an was about to press home his argument when someone squeezed
through the crowd and broke in:

“Holding a court debate between a new and old magistrate?”

It was Han Meng-hsiang, the very man Liu Yu-ying had come
to see. He must have just caught sight of her in the distance
and come across.

The announcer on the platform banged with his gavel to open
“September the Sixth Loan,” which had long been worth hardly
more than the paper it was printed on. Some business was
done on it, nevertheless. The floor was quieter now than it had
been for a long time.

“Ah! Yu-ying!” Han Meng-hsiang exclaimed, catching sight of
her and manoeuvring his way through to her. “So here you are!
Have you found Fatty yet? What a girl!—”

Liu Yu-ying immediately tipped him a wink and motioned
towards the others. Han Meng-hsiang smiled, and Liu Yu-ying
casually moved towards him.

“Have you any idea how much changed hands altogether this
session?” Li Chuang-fei inquired of Han Meng-hsiang in a low
voice, and shifted closer to him. The pair of them then drifted
away from the others and began conferring together in whispers,
while Feng Yun-ching and Ho Shen-an also settled down to a
private conversation. Suddenly Li Chuang-fei burst out laughing,
scurried past Han Meng-hsiang, and went across to talk with
someone by the platform.

The morning session was now over, only a dozen or so brokers
and customers remained, chatting in twos and threes. The
cleaners were sprinkling water on the floor and sweeping up the
cigarette-ends, From time to time a telephone would ring in the
brokers’ offices. One man stood with notebook and pencil, peer-
ing up at the quotation boards and jotting down the price-
changes. These blackboards, chalked with figures, hung in a
neat row all along the latticed balustrade of the gallery. All
was peaceful and calm—except the minds of the speculators,
which were still as tense as ever; during this short lull in the
fighting they were preparing for another fierce battle in the
afternoon.

“I say!” whispered Li Chuang-fei to his two partners when he
returned from his conversation with the man by the platform.
“Tu Kuang-shih says that Wu Sun-fu’s buying! I don’t understand
it at all! What do you make of it?”

His face, which had been glowing with elation before, was now
pale with chagrin.

Feng Yun-ching and Ho Shen-an exchanged glances but made
no comment. After a moment a whispered dispute broke out
between the three of them. It was short and sharp, and ended
with Li Chuang-fei stalking out in high dudgeon. After he had
gone, first Feng Yun-ching and then Ho Shen-an left the Ex-
change. As he passed through the main entrance Feng Yun-
ching saw Liu Yu-ying and Han Meng-hsiang standing there
in conversation, and he had a sudden vision of his daughter Mei-
ching, his “ray of hope” and the one “beacon” in the dark sea
of his bewilderment.

Liu Yu-ying watched his retreating figure, her lips compressed
into a contemptuous line.

*

Feng Yun-ching took a rickshaw home. He rode with closed
eyes, for the wind, which was now flercer than ever, was blowing
straight into his face, The trees lining the streets added their
strident voices to the noise of the wind, and it seemed to Feng
Yun-ching as he bowled along in the rickshaw that he could
still hear the pandemonium on the floor of the Exchange. As
he neared home he experienced an overwhelming anxiety. He
began to ask himself what he should do if Mei-ching had failed
in her mission, or if she had misunderstood. It had become a
matter of life or death for him.

Once he was home, however, his anxiety passed. He had
faith in his daughter, and faith also in the aid and protection
for which he had prayed so earnestly to the spirits of his ancestors
the night before last.

The first thing he asked the servant when he got in was:
“Has Mei-ching come home yet?” He had already decided that
if the answer was yes, it would be a good omen and the odds
were that his luck had held. After all, Heaven helps those who
help themselves! As it turned out, his daughter had just re-
turned and was now asleep in her room. When he heard this,
his pale, haggard face lit up with delight. Forgetting that he
was tired and hungry, he immediately dashed upstairs.

Finding the door of her room closed, he pulled up abruptly
and hesitated. He could not decide whether to knock and go in
or wait a while untif she was ready. He was naturally agog
to hear the precious news as soon as possible so that he would
be free to get things going; but then she had only just got
back and her door was shut, so perhaps she wanted a little
privacy—she might be changing or having a wash. If he butted
in at this inopportune moment he would most probably offend
the God of Good Luck, and then his good luck would be changed
to bad!

While he was standing there hesitating, his concubine suddenly
appeared with a bulging handbag in her hand, evidently just
off out.

“Aht Just the man I want!” she shrilled. “I've got a bone to
pick with you!”

So saying, she grabbed him by the ear and hauled him into
her room.

A sheaf of bills was thrust into his hand: fortnight-old bills
from the rice-shop, the coal merchant, the car-hire people, the
greengrocer, the tailor, and the confectioner. There were a
couple of receipts among them — one from the Electricity Com-
pany and one for last month’s rent. His eyes opened wide as he
went through them one by one, and when he came to tot them
up in his head he found they came to about four hundred dollars.

“But, Chiu, didn’t you tell the rice-shop, the coal merchant
and the car-hire people that we’ll settle up in full next quarter-
day?”

“Bah! It's all very well you standing there and saying that,
but do you expect me to have the cheek to go and say it to them,
too? Let me tell you this: Ive paid all the pbills--every one
of them! Four hundred and thirty-one dollars odd—and I want
it back today!—I had to borrow the money of one of my friends!”

“Oh, dear! Look, Chiu, give me a few days and I can let you
have it. I’m hanged if I’ve got even a hundred dollars on me
today!”

He smiled placatingly and tucked the bills away in his pocket.

“All right, then: if you can’t pay me in cash you can give
me the passbook for that ten thousand dollars in the Yuan Feng
Bank and we'll leave it at that.—Just as a pledge.”

“Oh no, Chiu! I couldn’t do that! It wouldn’t be right! In
any case, it’s only a matter of four hundred dollars or so. You
can’t expect a passbook for ten thousand dollars as a pledge
for that amount—”

“What do you mean ‘only four hundred dollars!’ You're off
your head! What about the five thousand dollars I borrowed for
you from Wu? Four hundred indeed! She lent us that money
out of the kindness of her heart. She trusted us and didn’t
even ask for a security. The month will soon be up: I hope you’re
not thinking of letting us down!”

As she spoke, the concubine arched her pencilled eyebrows,
and with every word she became angrier and more fearsome.

Feng Yun-ching was doing his best to hold his apologetic smile.
So far as the five-thousand-dollar loan was concerned, he had a
shrewd idea that all this talk about having borrowed the money
from Mr. Pai’s concubine Wu was just not true. He strongly
suspected that it had come out of Chiu’s own savings, though it
was more than he dared do to let on that he knew.

She gave him a few more lashes with the end of her tongue,
then, realizing that it was getting late, she took herself off.

When she had gone, Feng Yun-ching jumped up and stretched
as if he had just been granted an amnesty. He thought for a
moment, then strode back to the door of his daughter’s room.
It was now standing ajar. He gave a warning cough, then pushed
the door open and walked in. Feng Mei-ching was sitting at her
dressing-table by the window, gazing into the mirror with a
faraway look in her eyes. She turned and when she saw it was
her father she giggled and quickly buried her face in her arms
on the dressing-table.

Outside the window, the wind was whistling and blowing
against the bamboo screen, so that it tapped against the glass.

As he stood beside his daughter, Feng Yun-ching’s eyes moved
from her head of black hair and her snowy neck down over
to her slender, half-turned waist to her shapely legs, which were
stretched out sideways outside the leg of the dressing-table. Pres-
ently, he heaved a satisfied-sounding sigh and asked quietly:

“Well, Mei-ching, have you found out all about it?”

“About what?” Mei-ching asked, lifting her head abruptly
and starting as if with surprise—no, not “as if’: her surprise
was genuine, for she had clean forgotten about all her father’s
careful instructions about finding an opportunity to get the re-
quired information from Chao Po-tao. It was not until her father
asked her about it that she suddenly remembered it.

“Oh, Mei-ching, about government bonds, of course! Is he bull
after all, or is he a bear?—”

“Oh ... that!’ Mei-ching answered hesitantly, looking into her
father’s face. “But Daddy, I don’t quite understand what you
mean.” Her mind was in a turmoil: should she tell her father
straight out that she had not yet tried to find out, or should she
just beat about the bush and hope she could muddle through?

Or should she simply make something up to put him off? She
decided to try and muddle through.

“you don’t understand what I mean? What don’t you under-
stand?”

“Well, all this about ‘bulls’ and ‘bears.’ I've heard people
talking about them, but I’m not quite sure what they mean.”

“Ha ha! You must have found out about it, then! You silly
girl! A ‘bull’ is a man who buys government bonds, and a ‘bear’
is a man who sells government bonds.”

“Oh, then he must be a bull!” she said without hesitation, then
giggled. She was not consciously telling a lie: after all, wasn’t
Chao Po-tao a rich man? Only a rich man could afford to buy
things, and anyone who had to sell things must be poor! Being
still but a child at heart, she reasoned that if Chao Po-tao were
reduced to selling things, he would cease to be Chao Po-tao—at
least, he would cease to be the Chao Po-tao that the women
were fond of!

“Er—are you quite sure? ‘You're sure he’s a bull?” Feng Yun-
ching insisted, fearing that he might have misheard. Even as he
spoke his leathery old face was beaming with delight and his
heart was pounding violently.

“Yes, I’m certain of it!” she replied after a moment’s thought,
then burst out giggling again and buried her face in her arms
on the dressing-table as if to hide her embarrassment.

Just then a sudden gust of wind lifted the bamboo screen out-
side the window. and banged it against the eaves. Then came a
fiercer gust still, which made the window rattle loudly.

Feng Yun-ching was startled for the moment, but immediately
decided this was a good omen; he remembered there was a prov-
erb which went something like this: “When a bamboo screen
flies up on to the roof, the master of the house is going to make
a fortune.” Thereupon he decided to stake his all on one throw
of the dice: he was going in as a bull! He would even appro-
priate that sacred ten-thousand-dollar deposit which was set
aside as his daughter’s dowry. He hurried out of her room and
went straight out into the street.
XII

Wu Sun-fu’s careless smile was fading and giving way to a
brooding expression; his purplish, pimpled face twitched
slightly, and tiny beads of sweat gradually appeared on his tem-
ples. Avoiding Liu Yu-ying’s eye, he sat looking sideways out
of the window and drawing crosses on the table-top with the mid-
dle finger of his right hand.

A passer-by had apparently stopped just outside, for the
shadow of the top of a head had appeared on the patterned
window pane. The shadow moved away, and another one ap-
peared. Suddenly, there came the voice of a newsboy running
Past the window: “‘Stop-press News!’ Read all about it! Yen
Hsi-shan orders his troops to the front! Big battle at Tehchow!
Tsinan threatened! Read all about it! Circular telegram from
the other side of the Great Wall!” Then came the voice of an-
other newsboy selling the “Stop-press News,” bawling as he ran
past.

Wu Sun-fu’s eyebrows jerked up, and he suddenly sprang to
his feet and began pacing round the room. He stopped in front
of Liu Yu-ying and stood quite close to her, his piercing eyes
searching her made-up face and boring into her eyes, which had
a suspicion of dark rings under them, as if he hoped to see
through into the recesses of her mind.

She submitted to this scrutiny in unsmiling silence, patiently
waiting for his next move.

“Yu-ying, you must do as I tell you—” he said slowly and
quite firmly, without withdrawing his piercing gaze. Then he
paused as if to arrange his ideas in proper order before telling
her just what it was she was to do. Liu Yu-ying’s lips twisted
into a smile as she realized she was “getting results.” Her heart
pulsed with excitement and she could not help breaking in:

“But Uncle, I hope you realize the difficulties of my position.”

“Yes, I fully realize your position. You want to be sure you’ve
got something to fall back on in case Chao Po-tao should find
you out, don’t you? Well, you can leave that to me to take care
of. After all, we’re relations, and we ought to stand by one
another. Now, listen, Yu-ying: first of all you must make sure
of Han Meng-hsiang. I’m sure you'll be able to manage that
all right. And don’t—”

Liu Yu-ying smiled again and blushed.

“And don’t go ringing round everywhere trying to find me
in future, and don’t come to see me at the Yi Chung Trust
Company! If you do, Chao Po-tao will soon find out that you're
in touch with me and then he’ll be on his guard against you—”

“Oh, I quite realize that. I was trying to get in touch with you
for the first time today, and the only way I could do it was to
ring up the different places. V’ll be very careful in future.”

“Ah, I can see you’ve got your wits about you! Right, now
the other thing is this: I want you to take a room in a nice
quiet hotel so that we'll have somewhere to meet and talk things
over. I’ll come round to see you every evening about six o'clock,
so you be there waiting for me—can you manage it all right?”

“Tm afraid I can’t make it every evening. I can never tell when
I’m going to be busy.”

“Oh, that’s all right—So long as you just give me a ring at
the Yi Chung Company if you find you can’t get away.”

“And what if you’re not there?”

“Ym always there from four to five. If by any chance I’m
not there, ask for Mr. Wang—Wang Ho-fu, H-o-f-u. You can
always give him a message. You can’t mistake him: he’s a
northerner and he always shouts.”

Liu Yu-ying nodded and smiled understandingly. Suddenly
the shadow of a head flashed across the patterned window-panes
again, and then there was a thud as the head bumped against
the window, almost knocking it open. Wu Sun-fu turned his head
sharply towards the window and looked slightly annoyed. By
now, the shadows of two heads were visible, one higher than the
other, jerking to and fro. Suddenly suspicious, Wu Sun-fu moved
quickly over to the window and snatched it open to reveal two
angry faces glaring at each other with a fierce determination to

fight it out if necessary. A couple of tramps quarrelling. Wu
Sun-fu shrugged and closed the window, then returned to his seat
at the table and wrote out a cheque. As he handed it to Liu
Yu-ying he said quietly:

“And mind you don’t take a room like this: it’s too noisy! You
want one upstairs and without a passage under the window.”

“Don’t worry, Ill arrange everything just right. Is that all,
Uncle? There’s just one thing I’d like to mention—”

“What's that?” asked Wu Sun-fu, tilting his head and raising
his eyebrows slightly.

“You'll have to get round Hsu Man-li and stick close to her
so that Chao Po-tao will go on suspecting her and giving her
the cold shoulder. That’s the only way we can make sure that
she doesn’t give me the lie and ruin my chances of seeing him
frequently and finding out anything more. If you don’t know
her very well, you'll have to hurry up and get to know her.”

Wu Sun-fu puckered up his brows, but nodded all the same.

Outside the window, the two tramps suddenly burst into streams
of abuse. They were apparently quarrelling about money. “Think
you can double-cross me, eh? I’ll show you a thing or two!’’ The
voice rose clear and loud, and when Wu Sun-fu heard it his frown
deepened. Glancing at Liu Yu-ying, he shook himself and stood
up, but she was already making a second request.

“One thing more, Uncle: I think I can manage Han Meng-
hsiang all right, but not if I have to rely on just talking him
round—we’ll have to make it worth his while. Chao Po-tao’s very
fond of ‘dollar diplomacy,’ you know! If you’re prepared to give
Han Meng-hsiang some encouragement, you must give me some
idea of how far you can go so that I can get to work on him at
the first opportunity.”

“Er—well, I can’t say for certain straight away—I’ll let you
know in a day or two.”

“Oh, and one other thing—” she began, then stopped and
giggled. She blushed and flashed a glance at him.

“Well, come on, let’s hear what it is,” he said hesitantly, notic-
ing something peculiar about her smile and the look she gave
him. He could not help feeling that this woman detective was
proving rather too much of a stickler for detail for his liking;
and, with things going the way they were, he was beginning

to have his doubts about her—at least, he was not so sure he
could handle her easily.

“Well, it’s this: what shall I call you when you come to see me
in our private room?” she said softly. She made an apparent
effort to stop giggling, and her dark eyes gleamed seductively.

When he heard what it was she wanted to know, he smiled
briefly, but failed to notice her blatantly suggestive look. He drew
a sigh of relief, then stood up and said indifferently, “We're
relations, so I shall still be ‘Uncle.’”

So saying, he waved her a perfunctory good-bye and hurried
off. As he drove away from the hotel, he became suddenly con-
scious of the suggestion implicit in her smile, her blushes and
the look she had given him a moment ago, and his heart leapt
wildly; but the emotional disturbance was purely momentary,
and his thoughts returned immediately to Chao Po-tao and the
subject of government bonds. When the chauffeur turned his
head inquiringly, he just snapped:

“The Stock Exchange—and fast!”

It was getting on for three o’clock, and a scorching sun had
softened the asphalted roadways, so that each passing car left
its pattern of tyre-marks imprinted on the surface. In the streets,
grimy, perspiring tramps and urchins were hawking the various
“Stop-press editions,” bawling a bewildering variety of mutually
contradictory headlines in an equal variety of voices.

Wu Sun-fu had flashed in and out of the Exchange and was
driving to the Yi Chung Company offices. His mind was totally
absorbed in plans for his various businesses, when suddenly he
realized that he was full of serious contradictions himself. As an
industrialist whose one great ambition was to help develop
China’s own industry, he had all along objected on principle to
the way financiers like Tu Chu-chai employed their large capital
solely in speculation in real estate, gold bars, and government
bonds; yet he himself was now head over ears in government
ponds! He had been hoping that a truly democratic régime would
soon materialize in China, and so he had also hoped for a speedy
and successful conclusion of the military campaign being waged
by the Enlarged Conference of the North; but, now that he had

heard from Liu Yu-ying that his rival Chao Po-tao was turning
bear and was preparing to resort to his “old methods” to snatch
a victory, his main fear was that the campaign might be develop-
ing too rapidly for his present purposes! The last thing he
wanted was to see any changes in the military situation in
Shantung during the present month—that is to say, within the
next five or six days. On top of this contradiction he had another:
he had to use the limited capital in the Yi Chung Trust Company
both for speculation in government bonds and for developing the
eight recently-purchased factories. A month ago he had spared
no effort to lay his hands on Chu Yin-chiu’s cocoons and up-to-
date filatures, but now that he had succeeded, and had taken one
more factory into his “iron hand,” he found it was something of
a white elephant without the capital to run it, and was more
trouble than it was worth.

All these contradictions had come upon him all at once and
so quickly that he had become deeply involved without realizing
what was happening. Although he was now fully aware of their
existence, it was already too late to pull out. He knit his brows
in a tight frown and smiled wryly to himself.

But he was not a man to be easily daunted, for he had enough
confidence in himself to see him through. Difficulties, he reas-
sured himself, were only stepping-stones to success, only hurdles
to be jumped. Was it not for the sake of foiling Chao Po-tao's
conspiracy to establish a “finance trust” that he, Wu Sun-fu, was
determined to wrestle with him on the Exchange floor and defeat
him there? This was the chief cause of all the trouble. Such
was the “rational” interpretation Wu Sun-fu put on his contradic-
tions. There was just one problem that still worried him—that
of the Yi Chung Trust Company: he still had to find a practical
solution to the problem of how to speculate in government bonds
and expand the eight factories at the same time. To make things
worse, there was not the slightest hope of dissuading Tu Chu-
chai from backing out of the company, and the loss of his support
would prejudice the company’s chances of getting the help they
had hoped to get from the banks. This presented the biggest
difficulty of all at the moment: until he had cleared this obstacle,
there was no point in considering his next step!

The car stopped and his train of thought stopped with it for
the time being. As he hurried into the company building he was
worried, though not to the extent of despairing.

As he passed the counter, he noticed someone withdrawing a
deposit and arguing heatedly with the cashier. What was the
matter? he wondered. Was there anything wrong with the seal?
Or was the figure incorrect? Whatever it was, it could not
warrant such a red-faced display of anger! Wu Sun-fu glanced at
the customer with a frown, then dashed straight up the stairs
and burst into the general manager’s office. Although it was
called an office, it was furnished like a conference room, and
the general manager’s actual office was a “private den” next
door to it. At that moment Wang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-jen were
engaged in a téte-a-téte in the conference room; when Wu Sun-
fu dashed in looking rather distraught, they sprang to their feet
in wide-eyed surprise. Wu Sun-fu smiled reassuringly, but was
in for a shock himself, for Wang Ho-fu immediately burst out:

“So you’ve come, Sun-fu! We've run into a bit of trouble!
We've been on the phone hunting for you high and low but
couldn’t find you anywhere!”

“He had a job chasing me up, too,” added Sun Chi-jen. His
voice was as calm and unhurried as usual, but his face betrayed
a certain anxiety. “We were just discussing what to do about
it. It’s not as serious as all that, but it’s come just at a time
when we’re pressed for money, so it’s a bit of a nuisance! The
point is you know that loan of a hundred thousand dollars that
the Yuan Ta Native Bank promised us last week? Well, now
they’ve changed their minds—though they were very nice about
it, of course! Well, that’s the score.”

Wu Sun-fu was calmer now. Although the blow had fallen
rather earlier than he had counted on, it was not altogether
unexpected. Since the loan had been arranged through the good
offices of Tu Chu-chai, it was only natural that it would fall
through now that Tu Chu-chai had dropped out of the company.
Calming himself with an effort and temporarily dismissing from
his mind the question of government bonds, Wu Sun-fu con-
centrated his attention on the problem of bridging this sudden gap.

The loan had been intended to defray the payment of the wages
of the two thousand six hundred workers in the eight factories
and to buy new stocks of raw materials.

Wang Ho-fu brought out a pile of books and papers for Wu
Sun-fu and Sun Chi-jen to look over, and gave them a brief
summing-up:

“The wages total a little over fifty thousand dollars. They’re
paid at the end of the month, which gives us five or six days’
grace, so it’s not all that urgent. What really does matter is
that we’ve taken delivery of certain raw materials—rubber,
umbrella-rrames, electrical goods, turps and sulphuric acid—which
come to over seventy thousand dollars altogether; and all the
goods must be paid for within two or three days.”

Wu Sun-fu, who had been deep in thought, stroking his chin
absent-mindedly, glanced up at Sun Chi-jen. With the end of
the month only a few days away, he himself had to find the
money to pay the workers in his own silk factory and also the
one recently taken over from Chu Yin-chiu. “This meant he would
have to do some fast thinking on his own account. His enterprises,
it was true, had multiplied, but never before had he found himself
so short of ready money. The total value of his assets had gone
up by leaps and bounds—at a conservative estimate, he put the
increase at two hundred thousand dollars—but a hundred thou-
sand of this was locked up in the cocoons stowed away in a
warehouse. On top of that, there had recently been a sharp
drop in silk prices, so that he just could not afford to sell off his
stock of silk, which meant another one hundred thousand tied
up. To crown it all, more than a hundred thousand was frozen
down in the country as a result of the peasant rising. Con-
sequently, the company’s present deficit, though it amounted to
no more than a hundred thousand, was proving an insurmountable
difficulty however hard he racked his brains.

“So we must have seventy thousand dollars within two or
three days, eh? Well, just you leave it to me!—” This cheerful
offer to find the money came from Sun Chi-jen. As he said this,
he glanced at Wu Sun-fu, for he was well aware of the latter’s
financial straits. He paused a moment to flick through the books
and papers, then went on:

“Though of course all this robbing Peter to pay Paul won't
provide a permanent solution to the problem, even though it'll
tide us over. Apart from the eight factories, we've got Chen
Chun-yi’s silk goods manufactory on our hands on a one-year con-
tract, so that although you can’t say we're going in for things
in a really big way, we’ve still got our hands full. This means
we must have an over-all plan. We started with a paid-up
capital of eight hundred thousand dollars, which we laid out
on buying the old Yi Chung Trust Company together with the
eight factories. Now that Tu Chu-chai’s withdrawn his share
of the capital, we’ve only got about four hundred thousand left,
and this has gradually become locked up in government bonds.
I was thinking, this small amount of capital is just not enough
to run the factories and speculate on the stock market, both at
the same time. We'll just have to drop one or the other of them.
The trouble is, we’re in both things right up to the neck, and we
can’t easily give up any one of them.”

“Tf it’s just a question of keeping the eight factories running as
they are now,” said Wang Ho-fu, “I think we might be able to
scrape through on four hundred thousand dollars; but I thought
we'd decided to expand them? Besides, we've still got Chen
Chun-yi’s silk goods manufactory to think about. No, I don’t
think four hundred thousand would be enough! And what with
the war disrupting communications, there’s no way of shipping
our products anywhere. We haven’t even been able to cover our
overheads this month. Yes, I agree with Chi-jen that we must
have an over-all plan!”

The factories were Wang Ho-fu’s special responsibility, so it
was the factories that he emphasized.

While listening to his partners, Wu Sun-fu had been thinking
things over, and now his face suddenly took on a look of deter-
mination. He glanced up at them, his eyes alight with courage
and optimism. The look in his eyes was the one which could
always inspire his colleagues with enthusiasm, fire their im-
agination and steel their will; it was that look of compelling
intensity which came into his eyes whenever he was drawing
up some great plan or making an important decision, a look that
made lesser mortals quake.

Just as he was going to speak, however, there was suddenly
a tap on the door.

“Who’s that? Come in!” called Wang Ho-fu, turning towards
the door and then rising from his seat with an air of impatience.

The head of the business department downstairs appeared.
Hunched forward, he tiptoed lightly and swiftly across to Wang
Ho-fu, and said in a low voice:

“There’s someone else here who wants to withdraw his deposit
before the time’s up. We showed him our new regulations, but
he wouldn’t take any notice. He said he was quite willing to
forfeit his four months’ interest. We suggested that he might
discount it, but he wouldn’t hear of it. He’s making a great deal
of noise at the counter. What should I do about it, sir?”

Wang Ho-fu snorted, and instead of replying he glanced round
at his two partners. Wu Sun-fu frowned, while Sun Chi-jen
rubbed his chin and smiled wryly. Wang Ho-fu turned to the
head of the business department again and asked, “How much
is it?”

“Ten thousand dollars.”

“Oh, ten thousand, eh?—Oh, all right, let him have it. And
don’t insist on discounting it, either. Oh, damn!”

The man nodded with a respectful smile and quickly tiptoed out
again. The door, which was fitted with a Yale automatic closing
device, closed slowly and lightly behind him; there was a slight
thud, after which a deathly hush suddenly filed the room.

“What a nuisance! It happens almost every day!’ muttered
Wang Ho-fu to himself as he sat down again. Lighting a Garrick
and blowing out a cloud of smoke, he went on, “All these odds
and ends of deposits were passed over to us by our predecessors.
Now about sixty per cent of the total amount has been with-
drawn.”

“Oh!—What about the deposits we’ve taken in ourselves?”
asked Sun Chi-jen.

“Oh, there’s enough to see us through,’”’ Wang Ho-fu replied,
leafing through the books. “Tang Yun-shan has roped in over a
hundred thousand dollars in deposits, some fixed and some cur-
rent. 1 think we have quite good prospects of absorbing more.”

Wu Sun-fu smiled, then suddenly his eyes smouldered. He
looked from Wang Ho-fu to Sun Chi-jen, then said firmly:

“ret’s send round a circular tomorrow informing the old de-
positors that we'll accommodate them by permitting them to with-
draw their deposits prior to maturity within the next fortnight
with interest calculated on a daily basis. What do you say to that,
Chi-jen? We're just wasting our time messing about with these
odds and ends. There must be a reason for all these old deposi-
tors rushing to withdraw their money, and it’s my conviction that
they’ve heard rumours that our credit isn’t good. And you know
who our champion rumour-monger is—Chao Po-tao! Just now
he’s doing everything he can to put a spoke in our wheel. He
said once that if the banks tightened their credit a little, we'd
be done for. That was no idle threat: he’s up to his tricks
already!”

“you're quite right!” Wang Ho-fu hurriedly put in. “The way
the Yuan Ta Native Bank let us down today must have been
Chao Po-tao’s work, too. I detected it in the way the manager
spoke this morning.”

“And then again, look at this business of Tu Chu-chai. It ap-
peared on the face of it that the reason why he backed out of
the company was that he couldn’t agree to the purchase of the
eight factories. If the truth were known, it was because Chao
Po-tao had put the wind up him with his rumours. Tu Chu-
chai wouldn’t admit that to me, but it stood out a mile. When
he found that Tang Yun-shan had left for Hongkong, he kept
on at me to bring Shang Chung-li into the company, but I abso-
lutely refused, and the next day he decides to withdraw!”

“sta ha! He’s rather timid, Tu Chu-chai is rather timid,” said
Wang Ho-fu. “But, in all justice to him, he’s never shown any
great interest in running factories.”

He glanced at Sun Chi-jen, who nodded abstractedly. At this
moment, a dark cloud was gradually settling on Sun Chi-jen’s
mind: he was no more keen on stock speculation than Tu Chu-
chai was on factories. Not that he was averse to speculation on
principle, but he already had quite enough to cope with, and felt
he was not equal to speculation on top of his industrial enter-
prises. As it was, the company was deeply involved in both things,
and at every turn new dangers were looming up: it was becoming
more and more evident that Chao Po-tao’s projected “financial
blockade” against the company had already been put into opera-

tion. Things were so disheartening that he had come to the
conclusion that there was not much chance of their succeeding
in running the blockade. Still, they had no alternative but to
press on.

In spite of everything, Sun Chi-jen remained calm. Realizing
that Wu Sun-fu was waiting for him to express his opinion and
that Wang Ho-fu had no definite views of his own, he looked
calmly into Wu Sun-fu’s purplish face, which now looked alert
and excited, and said in his usual unhurried way:

“If we put our own house in order, we’ve got nothing to
be afraid of. Credit is credit, and rumours are only rumours:
we mustn’t let ourselves get flustered. I quite agree with Sun-
fu that we shouldn’t waste our time on trifles, and that since the
old depositors have been swallowing rumours we ought to send
out the circular and make them sit up with a jerk. But the first
thing we must do is to put ourselves in a strong position by re-
organizing the factories and putting them on a firm footing. Now,
let’s get it clear in our minds which of the factories can be over-
hauled so as to cut down costs, and which of them should be
expanded and the minimum amount of extra capital that would
take. Ho-fu’s just said that four or five hundred thousand dollars
won’t be enough, so even if we withdraw the capital now in-
vested in government bonds we’ll still be short and we'll have to
find some way of making it up. But just how much is needed for
expansion? How much can be saved on overheads? And how
much must we be prepared to lose during the next two or three
months due to a possible dull market? We must work out re-
alistic figures to cover all these things.”

“The cost of expansion has already been worked out in detail,”
replied Wang Ho-fu, for the factories were principally his re-
sponsibility. “It comes to a total of three hundred thousand
dollars for the eight factories together. And that’s an absolute
minimum!”

As he said this he was wondering to himself how their govern-
ment bonds were faring, since all the company’s ready money
of three hundred thousand dollars was invested in bonds. He
turned to Wu Sun-fu and was just going to ask about the state
of the stock market, when Wu Sun-fu forestalled him:

“As for the whole of the company’s capital going into govern-
ment bonds, we just had no choice in the matter: on the third
we just bought a million, in the hope of making a bit while the
going was good, but when the situation changed after that, we
had to hold out in spite of ourselves until we actually turned
bulls. At the moment we're holding ten million in bonds. At
this morning’s closing price we ought to be able to net around
three hundred thousand dollars, which isn’t too bad. Before I
came round here I told our broker to sell five million first thing
this afternoon.”

The light of victory shone in Wu Sun-fu’s eyes, and he rubbed
his hands with glee.

“But Sun-fu,” Wang Ho-fu chimed in hastily, looking as gleeful
as Wu Sun-fu, “don’t you think the rise will probably continue?
Ever since the fifteenth prices have been rising steadily, even
though it’s only been a matter of twenty or thirty cents a day.”

“Tt wouldn’t be too sure about that!” Wu Sun-fu replied. He
was smiling, but his voice was perfectly serious. He turned and
looked at Sun Chi-jen with such a look of determination and
confidence in his eyes as would have made the most hesitant of
men decide there and then to follow him. He now spoke rapidly
and clearly, and every word went home:

“Yes, the first thing we must do is to make sure our feet are
on firm ground! We're fighting a battle, a battle against two
enemies, one in front and one behind. Our enemy to the front
is competition from the Japanese factories in Shanghai; the
enemy to our rear is Chao Po-tao; and before we can get our
feet on firm ground, we'll have to beat both of them! As soon
as we possibly can we must put the eight new factories into
decent shape by tightening up on the management, putting really
efficient men in key positions, drastically cutting down waste of
materials, getting rid of redundant office staff and sacking any
undesirable elements among the workers! I don’t doubt for one
moment that the budget for every one of these factories could
be cut by twenty per cent!”

“Right-o, then,” said Sun Chi-jen calmly, apparently ignoring
the first and more important part of Wu Sun-fu's remarks, “let’s
cut their budgets by twenty per cent as from next month! So
far as the present office staff is concerned, I’ve thought all along

that they’re practically useless, but it’s so difficult to get hold
of competent people just now that we’ve had to keep them on;
but now we must come down on them hard. Ho-fu, you’re down
inspecting the factories practically every day, so you must have
some idea who should be the first to go.”

The gleam in Wu Sun-fu’s eyes—the gleam of optimism and
determination to fight it out with Chao Po-tao—was now re-
flected in Sun Chi-jen’s eyes. This was not lost on Wu Sun-fu,
who seized the opportunity to press his argument home:

“T was telling you just now that we had got rid of half of our
ten-million holding of bonds. Even so, it’s going to be a close
thing, because Chao Po-tao’s all set to ‘kill the bulls.’ For-
tunately for us, his secret leaked out today—-someone who's
well in with him sold me the information for a mere two thousand
dollars and promised to keep us informed of his activities into
the bargain! Chao Po-tao’s plan is to knock the bottom out
of the market just before the settlement at the end of the
month, But he little thought that we should unload half of
our holdings today! Tomorrow we'll get rid of the rest, and
Chao Po-tao’s little scheme will be knocked for six!”

As he was speaking, Wu Sun-fu sprang to his feet. He looked
for all the world like some great general telling the story of a
decisive battle he had won, and he was almost watering at the
eyes with excitement. He smiled at his two partners and added,
“We've got a better chance of beating Chao Po-tao now than
we've ever had!”

The question of reorganizing the factories was then temporarily
shelved, and their discussion concentrated on Chao Po-tao and
government bonds. Wu Sun-fu had won his victory. He first put
his own defence line in order: he made Sun Chi-jen and Wang
Ho-fu realize that to speculate in government bonds and expand
the factories at the same time, far from being a contradiction,
was in fact a necessary step towards success; he explained to
them that if would be suicidal to adopt a passive policy of “self-
sufficiency”—in other words, to try to manage without financial
assistance from the bankers; and he showed them that they
must defeat Chao Po-tao and run the “blockade” he had engineered
before they could really be sure of being able to stand their
ground. In the end, Wu Sun-fu had succeeded in increasing his

partners’ knowledge of Chao Po-tao and ensuring their animos-
ity towards him, thus transforming the Yi Chung Trust Com-
pany into the headquarters of the “anti-Chao camp.”

Finally, they returned to the subject of reorganizing the fac-
tories. In view of what had just been said, their efforts in this
direction were naturally redoubled. The reduction of staff, a
wage-cut, the increasing of working hours, besides a new set of
draconian regulations for putting the factories under the strictest
control, were all proposed and decided on in principle in little
more than ten minutes.

“Between three and five hundred workers to be discharged,
then,” began Wang Ho-fu, summing up, “Sunday overtime to be
abolished; working day to be extended by one hour without ad-
ditional pay; workers to be searched at the gate, both when
coming in and going out; ten per cent of the monthly wage to
be deducted by the management and retained as a deposit up
to a maximum of sixty-five dollars for each worker, to be re-
funded in the event of discharge.... I think all these regula-
tions can come into force immediately. Now, the last item—a
ten per cent wage-cut—well, I’m afraid they’li kick up rough
about that! The stopping of Sunday overtime is already as good
as a ten per cent wage-cut. If we knock off another ten per
cent on top of that, it’s going to be the last straw, and it’s quite
likely they’ll come out on strike, which will put us in a tight
spot. I propose we shelve this suggestion for the time being—
what do you say?”

Wang Ho-fu scratched his head and looked hesitantly at Wu
Sun-fu, whose face was tense.

Wu Sun-fu smiled, but before he could answer Sun Chi-jen
butted in, his voice betraying an unwonted excitement:

“No no, I can’t agree with you, Ho-fu! I think we're strict
where we must be, and more liberal than other people wher-
ever we can afford to be. Have you forgotten that we’re going
to grant a special bonus to those workers who exceed the norm
which we set? Take the electric light bulb factory, for instance:
the present daily quota for each worker is two hundred bulbs,
which is really a very considerate norm; but a skilful, conscien-
{ious man can easily make two hundred and fifty a day. If he

does, we'll give him a bonus of fifteen cents, which will mean that
over a month he’ll earn more than he ever did in the past.”

“Yes, Chi-jen, I must agree with you that we do very well by
our workers,” said Wang Ho-fu, who was not to be silenced so
easily. “But you must remember they’re a very unreasonable
lot: if you cut their wages, they notice it; if you offer them a
bonus, they don’t! Now, don’t think I’m afraid of trouble, Sun-
fu, but I really do think we should give the matter our careful
consideration.”

Being in charge of the eight factories, Wang Ho-fu was aware
of signs of unrest that had existed among the two thousand-odd
workers in them for some time.

Wu Sun-fu and Sun Chi-jen said nothing for the moment, and
the room was again plunged into a silence broken only by the
intermittent rumbling of trams passing under the windows,
through which the rays of the setting sun picked out the snowy
tablecloth and the sofa covers in a blaze of golden light.

A look of intense absorption and concentration had appeared
on Wu Sun-fu’s face. He was not worrying about a possible
strike, for he was always having one sort of trouble or another
in his own factory, and every time he had settled it without
much difficulty. There was one thing he had learned from these
experiences, however: that one must have loyal and competent
executives in one’s factory if one is to come out on top. At pres-
ent, he had not any such “good” staff for any of the company’s
eight factories, and the problem was made all the more difficult
by the fact that there was no co-ordination between the eight
factories. No, Wang Ho-fu’s fears could not be dismissed just
like that!

It so happened that what Sun Chi-jen next said showed that
he and Wu Sun-fu had been thinking along exactly the same
lines.

“Yes, I think it would be all right to leave the question of a
wage-cut open for a month or so; but there’s no getting away
from the fact that the executive staffs of the factories must be
reshuffled at once! Young hotheads and old stick-in-the-muds
must all go to make way for new blood! I was wondering if
you could spare a few men from your own factory, Sun-fu? We
must set ourselves a time-limit of one month to complete the

staff changes, and then during the following month we can an-
nounce the wage-cut. But the bonus system should be introduced
without delay, so that the workers realize that we're playing fair
with them and that those who are more highly skilled and whc
work hard can earn a nice fat pay-packet!”

As he listened, Wu Sun-fu nodded his approval. Then, all of
a sudden, there came the sound of heavy, hurried footsteps pound.
ing right up to the office door, and the agitated voice of the office
boy: “Who do you want to see? You can’t go rushing in just
like that!” The three men in the room looked up in surprise just
as the door flew open and their visitor burst in; he had a bulging
briefcase under his arm, and his face was bathed in perspiration.
He kicked the door to behind him, and as he marched across
the room he rapped out, “Yen Hsi-shan’s army’s on the march’
Tehchow’s in a state of chaos! How’s Tang Yun-shan getting
on in Hongkong? Have you heard from him yet?”

The intruder was Huang Fen, the famous blusterer.

Wu Sun-fu's face fell, but Wang Ho-fu laughed as he jumpec
up and asked quickly, “Is that true? When did you hear about
it?”

“Only half an hour ago — ’course it’s true!” Huang Fen gasped
thumping the briefcase under his arm as much as to say thal
he had the important news stowed safely away in it, so there
could be no mistake about it. “Had a wire from Yun-shan yet?’

“How about Tsinan?” Wu Sun-fu asked hastily, his bushy eye-
brows now quivering with agitation. “Surely they’ll have a big
battle on their hands when they get to Tsinan?”

“They'll take Tsinan in a matter of four or five days. Nc
question of a big battle there; the heaviest fighting will be along
the southern part of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway!”

“A matter of four or five days, eh?” Wu Sun-fu muttered tc
himself. “And no heavy fighting!”

He laughed hysterically, then stepped back and flopped on tc
a sofa: his face had suddenly become quite ashen and a look o:
ferocity had come into his eyes. The military situation along
the northern part of the Tientsin-Pukow line was changing muct
too rapidly!—So rapidly, in fact, that even he could not keer
pace with it, for all his alertness and agility!

The significance of the news had also struck Sun Chi-jen; he
heaved a deep sigh, then glanced from Wu Sun-fu to the clock
on the wall: just on four o’clock. His thoughts immediately went
to the Exchange: perhaps at this very minute prices were plung-
ing down to the limit amid the frantic yelling of the crowd! His
heart pounded wildly, and he dared not think about it any more.

“Can’t understand you not hearing from Yun-shan!” said Huang
Fen, turning to go as abruptly as he had come. “Let me know
the moment you hear anything, Ho-fu!”

Wu Sun-fu sprang to his feet again, his teeth clenched tightly
together and his eyes glaring. He paced savagely round the
room, then suddenly wheeled round, stopped in front of an ap-
prehensive Wang Ho-fu and a mournful, brooding Sun Chi-jen,
and said in an excited, agitated voice, “So far as I can see there's
only one thing we can do—bribe the brokers to bring the settle-
ment forward two days! Didn't Huang Fen say that they
wouldn’t be in Tsinan for four or five days yet? Let’s say four
days; that means that if we can bring the settlement forward two
days we can just get it in before Tsinan falls, so that for all the
rumours there won’t be too rapid a slump. If the settlement’s
advanced by two days, that’ll mean that the account will be
closed in three days’ time. The bears won't be able to do much
tomorrow, and tomorrow we’ll get rid of our remaining five mil-
lion. If we can work it like this, we should be able to break
even.—Hm-m, I wonder what they’re up to now, suddenly put-
ting in a whole army like that?”

“Still, we’re lucky to have heard about it in time,” said Sun
Chi-jen. “It was the same last month: we heard in good time
about Chang Fa-kuei and the Kwangsi armies evacuating Chang-
sha, and so we were able to save ourselves before the rot set in.”

He said this partly to express his agreement with Wu Sun-fu’s
suggestion, and partly to give himself what consolation he could.

“Sun-fu, I think you're right! Let’s get cracking straight
away!”

Now that he had caught on to the idea, Wang Ho-fu was his
usual cheerful self again; he had faith in Wu Sun-fu’s resource-
fulness in a crisis.

“All right,” replied Wu Sun-fu, “I’ll ring up Lu Kuang-shih and
ask him to come round straight away. ‘Man proposes, God dis-

poses. I think ten thousand dollars would probably do the
trick.”

His voice was calmer now, and as he spoke he looked up at
the clock with puckered brows. Never, he thought, was the prov-
erb “An inch of time is an inch of gold” more true than now.
He smiled grimly and hurried into the “private den” next door
to ring up the broker.

Wang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-jen sat silent. The latter gazed at
a vase on the table in front of him, and then up at the chart on
the wall: “Plans for Industrial Development.” He was still fairly
calm, except that he kept stroking his chin. Wang Ho-fu, how-
ever, was fidgety. He went across to the window and stood look-
ing out for a moment, then suddenly came back and pressed the
bell. After a moment a young clerk poked his head round the
door and looked inquiringly at Wang Ho-fu, who beckoned him
in and indicated that he should sit down at a Chinese type-
writer under the window. When the typist had sat down, Wang
Ho-fu said:

“Now, type as I dictate. ‘New Bonus System. As an experi-
ment...in scientific management... with a view to increasing
production. ...’—-Come on, slow-coach! Can’t you go quicker than
that? “—with a view to increasing production...and in order to
encourage good workers...we have decided...to adopt... the
following new system....’ Come on, don’t dawdle!...‘the fol-
lowing new system’—got it? Now, new paragraph. ...”

“What's the news, Sun-fu?” Sun Chi-jen suddenly demanded.
Wang Ho-fu abandoned his typist and whirled round to find Wu
Sun-fu standing by the table, his hands clasped in front of his
chest and a look of exasperation on his face. Wang Ho-fu grunted,
then turned and snapped at the typist's back:

“That's all! You can go now!”

When the three of them were alone again, Wu Sun-fu muttered
through clenched teeth, “Half a dollar down already!”

Wang Ho-fu felt the blood freeze in his veins, and Sun Chi-jen
heaved a sigh. Wu Sun-fu took a couple of steps forward, his
head on his chest. When he looked up again, his eyes were
flerce.

“The session closed with a drop of half a dollar,” he muttered.
“Qur five million was unloaded first thing, when the quotation

was even five cents higher than the closing quotation of the
morning session. After that, the rot set in. We'll probably make
a profit of about a hundred and twenty or thirty thousand dollars
on the first five million, but it’s a job to say whether we’ll make
anything on the other five million. ‘Man proposes, God disposes.’ ”

“Don’t you believe it!” said Sun Chi-jen. He forced a smile,
but his voice trembled slightly. “There’s still tomorrow! Let’s
push ahead with our original plan. It’s man that does the dis-
posing!”

“That’s quite right!” echoed Wang Ho-fu, though without Sun
Chi-jen’s smile. “It’s man who does the disposing, and we've
still got tomorrow!”

Suddenly he turned, pulled the unfinished notice about the
“bonus system” out of the typewriter and flourished it at his
partners.

“As for the factories,” he cried, “we'll get cracking on them
tomorrow: discharge of three to five hundred workers, no work-
ing overtime on Sundays, working day to be increased by one
hour without extra pay, a deposit to be stopped out of wages,
and last but not least...a ten-per-cent wage-cut! Ill put up
the notice tomorrow morning. And if the workers cut up rough?
Huh! We'll bloody well close down the factories for a couple
of weeks and see how they like that! And, of course, all this
will apply to the silk goods factory on loan from Chen Chun-yi!”

“That’s the stuff! ‘Man disposes!’ Go ahead, Ho-fu!’’ Wu Sun-
fu and Sun Chi-jen simultaneously voiced their approval. Three
pairs of eyes now gleamed with an iron determination to squeeze
out of the nine factories, by every means in their power, compen-
sation for their possible loss on the Stock Exchange: it was their
only way out!

*

It was nine o’clock when Wu Sun-fu arrived home. He was
dead-beat. It was a muggy evening, with a sky full of stars,
and a slender, almost invisible crescent moon. Only in the shade
of the trees was there any suggestion of a breeze. His wife and
several others had come out into the garden for a breath of fresh
air, leaving the house in darkness except for two lighted windows
on the second floor, so that the building looked like some great

monster crouching in the gloom, while the two windows were
its gleaming, ravening eyes.

Mrs. Wu and her three companions were sitting under the trees
fringing the pond. Only one or two of the lights fixed on the
trees were on, and their clothes showed white against the dark
background of the trees. They were silent except for an oc-
casional faint sigh.

Suddenly Lin Pei-shan broke into a dreamy rendering of the
melancholy popular song Romona, then suddenly she stopped
again.

Ah-hsuan gave a low, despairing laugh.

A carp splashed in the pond.

Huei-fang was quite taken by the tune Lin Pei-shan had begun
singing, for it echoed her mood exactly. She thought how lucky
people were who could sing. Singing was another way of speak-
ing. When you had something you wanted to say, and no way
of saying it, and you sang, it was as if you were telling a dear
friend your inmost thoughts. She thought of what Fan Po-wen
had said to her that day, and in her pounding heart she felt
happy and afraid.

A pall of silence hung over the pond and over the four people
on the bank, each of whom was savouring the silence according
to his or her own individual mood. Suddenly, the silence was
shattered by an uproar which flooded outwards from some dis~-
tant storm-centre and swept over the group at the edge of the
pond: it was the angry voice of Wu Sun-fu raging and storming
in the house.

“Let's have some lights on here!—It’s enough to give you the
creeps!”

When the lights went on, his pyjama-clad figure was suddenly
visible in the blaze of light. He was standing on the veranda
in front of the drawing-room windows, looking angrily all round
as if seeking something to vent his rage on. The bath had washed
away his tiredness, but inside him there still seethed a volcano
of anger. He caught sight of the four white figures by the pond:
“Creeping about there like four ghosts!” he thought, and a sudden
fury welled up inside him. Just then the maid Wang Mah hap-
pened to walk past him carrying a tray of tea-things and head-

ing for the pond. Immediately seizing this opportunity to let
himself go, he roared at her:

“Wang Mah! What are you going out there for?”

“Madame and the others are sitting out there by the pond—”

Without waiting for her to finish, he waved her impatiently
away, then turned and stalked back into the drawing-room. He
suddenly realized how ridiculous he had just made himself by
his display of bad temper. It was not at all like him to behave
like this, he thought. The glare of the lights in the drawing-
room, however, only served to make him more bad-tempered than
ever, and every bulb seemed to be a little furnace scorching and
blistering his skin. To make things worse, there was not a single
servant in attendance there. “Where have they all sneaked off
to?” he muttered. “Lazy good-for-nothings!” Furious, he bounded
out on to the front steps and roared:

“Come here, somebody! Blast you!”

“Here we are, sir!” came two voices simultaneously from the
bottom of the steps. As a matter of fact, the butler, Kao Sheng,
and Li Kuei, one of the footmen, had been waiting round the
corner all the time. Wu Sun-fu was taken aback by their sud-
den appearance, and just fixed them with a stony stare while
he tried to think of something to say to them. After a moment
he hit on something.

“Kao Sheng! Did you ring up Mr. Tu Wei-yueh and ask him
to come round as I told you? Why hasn’t he turned up yet?”

“Yes, I rang him, sir; but didn’t you say you wanted him over
at ten, sir?) Mr. Tu said he was busy but that he could get here
by half past—”

“Nonsense!” Wu Sun-fu interrupted with a sudden fury.
“What do you mean, ‘half past’! Don’t tell me you agreed to
half past ten?”

From the direction of the pond came the dreamy strains of Lin
Pei-shan’s melancholy Romona. The effect on Wu Sun-fu’s anger
was to pour oil on the flames. He stamped his foot, ground his
teeth and raved at Kao Sheng, “You blasted idiot! Go and ring
him up again and tell him to come round at once!”

He threw the last few words over his shoulder as he stalked off
fuming towards the pond, leaving Kao Sheng and Li Kuei gazing
open-mouthed at each other.

The romantic, melancholy atmosphere among the group by the
pond suddenly became still and tense: every one of them could
sense the approach of the “storm-centre,” and they prepared
themselves for an outburst of gratuitous invective. The nimble-
witted Lin Pei-shan darted away and hid in the trees, where she
put her hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh and peeped out,
straining her ears and eyes. Ah-hsuan, who was not over-bright
on occasions like this, just stood there going through the motions
of throwing a recently-acquired and highly-prized throwing-
knife. His sister Huei-fang had become suddenly absorbed in
watching the carp which kept rising to the surface of the pond
and sending up bubbles. Mrs. Wu, who knew what was com-
ing, lolled lazily against the back of her chair with a smile on
her lips.

Wu Sun-fu, however, did not flare up at once. He frowned and
narrowed his eyes and looked around as if selecting a victim to
get his teeth into. Actually, he really did feel like biting! He
felt that only by “getting his teeth into” someone could he work
off the rage that had consumed him ever since his return home.
Such a “bite” would not, of course, be a real one, but it would
afford him the same relief as a physical bite. He glared round
for a moment until his eyes fell on the thing in Ah-hsuan’s hand.
Like the mousing cat that stalks in silence and keeps her sharp
teeth and claws hidden, he asked in a quiet voice:

“Ah-hsuan, what’s that you’ve got in your hand?”

Ah-hsuan was so flustered that, instead of answering, he just
held out his precious throwing-knife for his elder brother’s in-
spection.

“What the devil's this! Who teaches you to play about with
this sort of thing?”

Wu Sun-fu was fierce both in look and voice, but Ah-hsuan’s
manner was so laugh-provoking that the former precariously
parted his lips for a second.

“Fr—Old Kuan is teaching me to use it,” Ah-hsuan stammered,
withdrawing his throwing-knife and turning to slip away; but
Wu Sun-fu peremptorily called him to a halt.

“Stop! Where do you think you’re going? ‘Throwing-knife’
indeed! Get rid of it! Throw it in the pond! A young fellow
turned seventeen and still wasting your time on such nonsense

as this! The trouble is, you’ve been spoiled down in the country!
The summer holidays are nearly over and you ought to be think-
ing about getting ready to go back to school!—Go on, throw it in
the pond!”

There was a heavy splash, and Ah-hsuan gazed miserably at
the ripples spreading out above his precious knife.

Wu Sun-fu’s irascibility appeared to have abated somewhat,
for his frown disappeared. His hard eyes turned next to his
sister Huei-fang. He was weli aware that she had been getting
much more friendly with Fan Po-wen lately—quite the reverse
of what he wished! As he remembered this, another wave of
anger swept over him. Nevertheless, he turned away from her
and looked at his wife again. She was leaning back in the chair
and gazing up bemusedly at the stars in the sky. Just lately she
had seemed to be pining away, and even her eyes, once so spar-
kling and eloquent, had now acquired a vacant stare; when, oc-
casionally, they recaptured their old vividness it was only to
blaze with anger. Something seemed to be continually gnawing
at her heart. And this change had come over her so slowly that
Wu Sun-fu had never noticed it. Once or twice he had had a
vague feeling that all was not well with her, but he had dis-
missed it and immediately forgotten it. Now he seemed to be
realizing it for the first time, and the sudden discovery only in-
tensified his exasperation. He immediately abandoned Huei-fang
and turned his attention to his wife.

“Pei-yao,” he said sharply, “you don’t have to stand on ceremony
with my own brother and sister! If they do anything wrong
you shouldn’t try to shield them! I don’t like all this hole-and-
corner business!”

His wife stared absently at him,.smiling but silent, which only
made him all the more incensed. He snorted savagely and went
on grimly, “Take Huei-fang for instance. I’m not an old-fashioned
diehard, and when it comes to a question of marriage I’m all
for taking account of the views of the people concerned. But
I, too, have a right to be consulted, to see whether it’s a good
match on both sides or not. It’s no use trying to go behind my
back! As a matter of fact, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to
this matter, and somebody has actually approached me about
arranging a match for her; but you people have to go behind my

back and make a mess of it—you’re going to make us look a
pack of fools!”

“Well, this sounds a bit strange to me,” said his wife, feeling
she ought to make some protest. “I don’t understand what you
mean about making a mess! If you've a suitable man in mind,
you might at least let us know who it is!”

He made no answer, but turned abruptly to his sister and said
sternly.

“Huei-fang, if you’ve got anything to say on the subject, let’s
hear it. We must get things straight so that I know what to do.”

Huei-fang hung her head till her chin rested on her chest; there
was not a single word from her in reply. Her heart was pound-
ing wildly. She was afraid of her brother, and she hated him.

“All right, then: if you’ve no ideas of your own, I'll arrange
everything for you!”

Wu Sun-fu felt the satisfaction of an archer in ambush whose
arrow has struck down an enemy. With a triumphant laugh he
turned and walked away. By the time he reached his study, this
crumb of satisfaction had evaporated, and he again felt the need
to “bite” someone—not just to relieve his pent-up rage, as he had
done a moment ago—but to “bite” at his real enemy in any way
he could to compensate himself for his loss. His angry mood
had passed, and it was in a cool, stubborn, relentless frame of
mind that he now set himself to the problem of making a desper-
ate attempt to fight his way out of the net which was closing
around him; but almost immediately he was gripped by a dismal
feeling of frustration and despair. His heart now leapt with
excitement, now sank into a torpor of despondency. His spin-
ning brain seemed no longer to obey his will: he was just re-
calling the momentous decisions he and his partners had made
in the managing director’s office of the Yi Chung Trust Company,
when suddenly he was assailed by a vision of Liu Yu-ying’s seduc-
tive smile, her blush as she flashed her eyes at him, and the echo
of the murmured temptation: “What shall I call you when you
come to see me...?” And just as he was cheerfully deciding how
to dispose his forces for a resounding attack on the eight factories.
he suddenly found himself faced with the prospect of the two
thousand-odd workers rising up in a desperate counter-attack....

No matter how he tried, he just could not concentrate; especially
when the memory of Liu Yu-ying’s inviting smile, her lovely voice
and her limpid eyes kept hammering away at his brain and dis-
tracting him as he tried to wrestle with his business problems.
This was madness! It was just not like him to lose his head over
a pretty face!

“Bah!” he roared, suddenly leaping to his feet and crashing his
fist on the table. “You Jezebel!”

“—bel!” echoed the walls of the study. The trees outside the
window rustled as if they were laughing at his vexation and con-
fusion. He collapsed into his chair again and gritted his teeth
in an effort to pull himself together and shake off this shameful
weakness and decadence that had taken possession of him and
rid himself of this feeling of pessimism and despair.

At this juncture the door opened softly and Tu Wei-yueh ap-
peared; he stood drawn up to his full height for a moment, then
bowed gravely. He turned to close the door behind him, then
walked calmly up to Wu Sun-fu’s desk and looked at him with
eyes that were placid yet alert.

For fully two or three minutes neither of them spoke.

Wu Sun-fu reached out and extracted a document from a pile
on the desk. He bent over as if he were perusing it, then picked
up a pen and twirled it in his fingers, so as to give himself time
to compose his features and recover his self-possession. After
a moment he looked up and indicated that Tu Wei-yueh should
sit down. His tone was casual and there was a smile on his lips
as he began, “I understand you said you were going to be very
busy the first time I rang. Are you free now?”

“Quite free,” came his laconic answer; but his twinkling eyes
spoke volumes. They seemed to intimate that he was quite aware
that Wu Sun-fu had been just having a fit of temper and depres-
sion, and that his present air of studied nonchalance was nothing
more than a pose—it was the slow circling of a hawk before it
swoops to the kill.

Wu Sun-fu lowered his eyes so that the young man should not
be able to read his thoughts. Still twirling the pen between his
fingers, he said, “I hear they’re having trouble with the workers
in some of the factories in Hongkew. Do you think anything will

come of it? And if anything does happen, do you think it might
affect our factories in Chapei?”

“Hard to say.”

This answer was one word longer than the first one, and Tu
Wei-yueh smiled guardedly as he made it. Wu Sun-fu looked
swiftly up and roared with what looked like feigned surprise,
“What! You sit there and say ‘Hard to say’! I should have
thought you would have stuck out your chest and said ‘No fear
of that in our factories!’"—I don’t want to hear you say ‘Hard
to say’: What I want to hear is ‘’m sure of it? All right!”

“1 could have said that in the first place, but the moment I
came in I smelt a rat—I guessed that you had orders for a wage-
cut to give me, so I changed my mind and said ‘Hard to say.’
Since you now want me to say ‘I’m sure of it,’ well, all right,
T am!”

Wu Sun-fu listened attentively, while his eyes scanned Tu Wei-
yueh's imperturbable face. After a short pause he asked, “Have
you made all necessary arrangements?”

“Still one or two things to see to—nothing much, though. Of
course, sir, when the axe falls, there’s bound to be a certain
amount of resistance; but within a day or two—three days at the
most—everything will be under control. Though it may be—”

“What!” interrupted Wu Sun-fu. You mean they might go on
strike? And for three days at that? No, I won't have it! If
they dare start any trouble, I must have it settled the same day!
D'you hear? The same day!—And what were you saying about
‘It may be’? It may be that the strike will last more than three
days, I suppose!”

His voice was harsh as he said this, though his expression re-
mained calm and unruffled.

“It may be,” replied Tu Wei-yueh with a mocking smile, “that
a single spark of trouble in our factory would set off a general
strike involving every silk filature in Shanghai!”

This was the fateful ladle of oil, so to speak, and the smoulder-
ing fires of Wu Sun-fu’s anger, which he had been managing te
control all this time, suddenly burst into flame. He flung down
his pen and with blazing eyes raved at Tu Wei-yueh:

“I don’t give a damn whether it means a general strike or not!
If there’s the slightest hint of trouble in my factory, Pll have
it settled the same day without any ifs or buts!”

“In that case you'll have to resort to force—”

“Quite! That’s just what I will do!”

“All right: in that case, sir, I must ask permission to resign!”

As he said this, Tu Wei-yueh stood up and fixed Wu Sun-fu
with a hard, fearless stare. A brief silence. Wu Sun-fu’s ex~
pression changed gradually from amazement to cool indifference.
Finally, he asked impatiently, “So you don’t like the idea of using
force, eh? Afraid?”

“Not a bit of it! Now, honestly, Mr. Wu: have I ever shown
any signs of being afraid? I don’t mind telling you, I think I’ve
put more than my share of hard work into the factory in the
past month, and I refuse to be a party to undoing all that I’ve
achieved through a salid month’s planning and effort! Still, you’re
the boss, and it’s up to you to do what you think best. All I ask
is that you accept my immediate resignation! And may I re-
peat that I’m not in the least afraid!”

He squared his shoulders proudly and riveted his keen eyes on
Wu Sun-fu’s face.

“I’m well aware that you’ve been making all these plans and
arrangements: I now intend to put them to the test and see
if they work!”

“All right, Mr. Wu; since you know all about it, let me tell you
one thing more. You say I must use force and settle any trouble
the same day. Nothing simpler: police, detectives, security guards
—they’re all ready and at our disposal. But if we settle the
trouble today, and it breaks out again in ten days or a couple
of weeks’ time, I don’t think you’d be at all happy about it. Be-
sides, I just couldn’t bring myself to betray your trust in me by
doing as you say—in fact, my present position of trust means a
great deal to me.”

For a while Wu Sun-fu could think of nothing to say. He
picked up his pen again, twirled it between his fingers, and sat
staring at Tu Wei-yueh’s face for quite a while. Tu Wei-yueh,
his face betraying not the faintest trace of emotion, was quite
content to let him look, though he was secretly rather surprised
at Wu Sun-fu’s unaccustomed hesitation.

After some deliberation, Wu Sun-fu asked at length, “Well,
what do you think we should do?”

“Well, I’m in favour of using a little force myself—but not till
the very end! Our workers aren’t all cast in the same mould:
some of them are a bad influence—Communists, most likely—and
some of the more stupid of the workers just tag along with them;
put the majority are timid and don’t want to get into trouble.
The reason I ask for three days to finish the job is because three
days of unrest will give me an excellent opportunity of finding
out for sure just who these suspected Communists are, and then
netting them all at one fell swoop! That’s where the use of a
little force comes in! After that, I think we can be sure of peace
and quiet for six months at least. This is what I’ve been work-
ing so hard for for the last month!”

Tu Wei-yueh had spoken calmly and self-confidently, a smile
on his lips; Wu Sun-fu had listened with concentrated attention,
but now he suddenly rolled his eyes upwards and laughed
grimly, then jumped up and roared excitedly:

“You may be very clever, Wei-yueh, but there are still certain
things that you don’t understand. You can’t make a clean sweep
of them just like that! They're like moth in a fur in the rainy
season—they just keep appearing one after the other! You catch
them all today, but tomorrow there’s another lot there! All you
can do is to wait until the rainy season is over. Unfortunately,
we're just coming into a ‘rainy season’ now, and it’s going to be
a long, long time—nobody knows just how long—before it’s over!
—Well, that’s that: your little plan will have to keep for the time
being. We just can’t afford that kind of patience as things are
at present!”

Tu Wei-yueh bowed but said nothing. He was thinking that
with this reverse his fate was surely sealed. If he did not re-
sign, his “régime” in the factory was doomed, and Chien Pao-
sheng and his clique would step into his shoes. Suddenly, Wu
Sun-fu flew into a rage again: his face dark with anger, he
barked out his orders:

“T don’t care whether there’s a strike or not, or whether there’s
a general strike for that matter: my mind’s made up! Starting
next month, there’s going to be a twenty-per-cent wage-cut! If
the price of silk goes up to over nine hundred taels a picul again,

I may consider a wage-increase—very well, you can go now! And
I won’t allow you to resign!”

“In that case, Mr. Wu, you must give me three days to do the
job!”

“Out of the question!’ Wu Sun-fu bellowed. “I can’t even give
you one day!”

Tu Wei-yueh’s face twitched and his eyes glinted dangerously.
Quite unexpectedly, Wu Sun-fu’s manner suddenly changed again;
he gestured impatiently and said, “Idiot! Thinking you can tie
me down! Wait until they’re gone on strike first, and then we'll
see about it.”

Tu Wei-yueh smiled and bowed again, but said nothing. He
could see quite clearly that Wu Sun-fu was not his usual self—
he seemed slightly abnormal, slightly flustered. And then he re-
membered that he himself was probably heading for disaster,
But he was tough, and there was plenty of fight left in him yet.
XI

T HERE had been no lightning yet, only an occasional rumble of
thunder like the sound of a heavily-laden lorry passing by. Over-
head hung a canopy of grey, unbroken but for a rift in the west-
ern sky, where a minute patch of purple cloud showed through.
Behind this purple cloud a disconcerted sun was dropping down
towards the horizon.

In the workshop of the Yu Hua Silk Filature all the lights
were already on. Spindles and fingers moved so quickly that
the workshop seemed to be one great nervously-pulsating
machine. The electric lights showed sallow-faced through the
dense clouds of steam, as if on the verge of fainting away. The
women, their ears dulled by the eternal noise of the machines,
could not hear the rumbles of thunder from the sky outside, but
they could still hear the babble of their own excited voices; here,
too, was an ominous growl of thunder, but of a different kind.
Their faces were flushed, and their tongues were as busy as their
hands. The foremen and forewomen seemed to be pretending
to be deaf—though not pretending to be dumb—and when they
occasionally muttered something a chorus of jeers burst from
the women.

All of a sudden the hooter blared through the factory, and there
was a commotion in the workshop. As the sound of the filatures
gradually died down the voices seemed to get louder. The women
jostled out of the workshop with their empty lunch-baskets on
their arms, milled around at the gate waiting to be searched,
and then swarmed out into the roadway. It was only then that
they realized that it was thundering and that an overcast sky
awaited them with its promise of a storm.

All was silent now in the factory, and the lights in the work-
shop were off, which made those that streamed from the windows

of the offices seem all the brighter. Tu Wei-yueh was sitting in
his office with bent head. The 32-watt bulb above him threw
a pale light on his face, which was as expressionless as that of a
statue. Suddenly the door opened, and Mo Kan-cheng’s flustered
face appeared round the edge of the door. He came in and said
in a low voice:

“Look here, Wei-yueh, Mr. Wu's just rung up to ask whether
the notice about the wage-cut’s been put up yet. I told him
you were going to do it tomorrow, and he didn’t sound at all
pleased about it! What are you going to do about it? The
women were kicking up a row when they Knocked off just now
—they must have got wind of it the same as they did last time—”

“So what?” said Tu Wei-yueh with a smile. “They’ve got to
know sooner or later!” He glanced at Mo Kan-cheng, then looked
out of the window.

“If Mr. Wu cuts up rough about it tomorrow, don’t blame me!”

“Of course not!”

Tu Wei-yueh was becoming impatient. Mo Kan-cheng fixed
his beady eyes on Tu Wei-yueh’s face for a moment, then hunched
up his shoulders; pulling a face as much as to say, “I should
worry!” he turned on his heel and went out, slamming the door
behind him.

Tu Wei-yueh smiled unconcernedly, but he could not go on
sitting there as motionless as a statue; he fished out his watch
and glanced at it, looked out of the window once more, then
opened the door and went out. He was just walking away when
his sharp eyes caught sight of two figures hurrying through the
gloom. They went straight into his office, and he retraced his
Steps. Just as he reached the doorway someone came up behind
him, tapped him on the shoulder, and giggled.

“Now, Ah Chen!” he whispered over his shoulder. “No sky-
larking. We're on our best behaviour tonight!”

He went into his office, and she followed behind him.

The two men waiting in the room were Kuei Chang-lin and
Pockmarked Li. The moment they saw Tu Wei-yueh, they both
uttered an excited “Ah!” and tried to get a word in first; but Tu
Wei-yueh checked them with a look and waved the two of them
and Ah Chen to a bench in the corner of the room, while he
himself went and stood with his back to the window. The elec-

tric light seemed suddenly dimmer, and the atmosphere in the
room was tense. Outside, thunder rolled slowly across the sky.
A little colour had returned to Tu Wei-yueh’s pale face. He
glanced at his three companions.

“Im! Where’s Yao Chin-feng got to?”

“We didn’t bring her along in case we attracted too much at-
tention,’ Ah Chen put in hastily. “Tf you've got a job for her,
I can easily pass it on to her later.” As she spoke, she threw
Tu Wei-yueh a coquettish glance. He nodded briefly, but said
nothing; nor did he return her amorous glance. His expression
suddenly became grim and he raised his voice slightly.

“From now on we must all put our backs into it and work to-
gether! There’s to be no more chasing after girls, no more petty
jealousies, and no more squabbling among ourselves!”

Ah Chen pulled a face and hemmed. Pretending not to have
noticed this, Tu Wei-yueh went on:

“Wang Chin-chen is unable to come, because I've sent her off
on something else; so there will be just the four of us in on this
discussion. Well, a short while ago, Mr. Wu rang up to see why
I hadn’t put the notice up yet. He’s getting pretty het up about
it and he didn’t sound at all pleased. I promised I’d announce
the wage-cut tomorrow for sure. Mr. Wu understands, of course,
that we need a little time to finish making all our arrangements
before the cut is announced. We shouldn’t have any trouble
coming to terms with him all right, but I can see our rivals try-
ing to get round him and cutting the ground from under our feet;
so I think we must use seventy per cent of our strength against
them and thirty per cent of it against the women! Chang-lin, do
you think we'll have trouble when the notice goes up tomorrow?”

“No doubt about it! Chien Pao-sheng and his lot are just spoil-
ing for a fight and they’ll make the most of this to try and put
paid to us! Dirty rats!”

“Mr, Tu!” put in Pockmarked Li quickly when he saw that
Kuei Chang-lin had no suggestions for definite action. ‘We've
only got to get my lads in, and then if there’s any trouble to-
morrow we won't stand any nonsense—we’ll just run ’em down
to the police station and see how they like that! If we’re nippy
about it we can get it over before Chien Pao-sheng and them
have a chance to do the dirty on us!”

Highly pleased with himself, he held out his great Paws, spat
into them, rubbed them together, clenched them into fists, placed
them on his knees, and adopted an aggressive attitude. Tu Wei-
yueh paid no attention to all this; he just smiled faintly and
turned again to Ah Chen.

“Ah Chen! Why don’t you say something? What were things
like in the workshop when you were there just now? How did
the women react to the rumour we put out about the wage-cut?
What did Hsueh Pao-chu and that girl Chou Erh-chieh have to
say about it? Well, let’s hear it! Don’t keep us waiting!”

“I don't know!” Ah Chen snapped, pursing her lips and turn-
ing her face away to look at the wall. “You’d better have Yao
Chin-feng in and ask her about it!”

Tu Wei-yueh’s face suddenly darkened. Kuei Chang-lin and
Pockmarked Li were amused and began making faces at Ah Chen
to tease her. His eyes blazing, Tu Wei-yueh stamped his foot
and was just going to let himself go, when Ah Chen gave in and
said crossly:

“What did they say? They said, ‘Down with Chamber-pot Tu!’—
meaning you! What did Hsueh Pao-chu and Chou Erh-chieh say?
They said, ‘Chamber-pot Tu is playing a dirty trick on us!’ and
a lot of other nice things, but I can’t remember them all now—
you’ve got nothing to laugh about, Chang-lin! They want to
get rid of you, too!”

Outside the windows the first flash of lightning lit up the sky.
A few seconds later a rumble of thunder was heard in the dis-
tance. Suddenly, a violent gust of wind swept into the room, and
the four of them gave a shiver.

A roar of indignation leapt to Pockmarked Li’s lips, but Tu
Wei-yueh silenced him with a wave of the hand and said im-
perturbably:

“We've got solid proof that Chien Pao-sheng and his lot are
trying to put a spoke in our wheel. What are we going to do
about it? Last night I told Mr. Wu that I wanted to resign, but
he wouldn’t hear of it for a moment. So all I can do is carry
on. Strictly speaking, disputes between different groups in the
trade union are none of my business; but I believe in seeing fair
play! Frankly, I think Kuei Chang-lin and his supporters are

being treated really badly and that Chien Pao-sheng’s being too
high-handed. Don’t you agree with me, Li?”

“You're dead right! Down with Chien Pao-sheng!” chorused
Pockmarked Li and Kuei Chang-lin, while Ah Chen giggled with
her hand over her mouth. Tu Wei-yueh squared his shoulders,
took a deep breath, and went on:

“It’s not that we want to make things difficult for Mr. Wu, but
the fact remains that Chien Pao-sheng and his crew are work-
ing for their own ends under the pretence of helping the workers,
and making use of them to establish their own power. We shan’t
have a day’s peace all the time they remain here. We're all suf-
fering merely to serve their selfish ends, which is grossly unfair!
Tomorrow they’ll be trying to set the women against us: very
well, we’ll take them on! Once we've got Chien Pao-sheng and
his gang out of the factory, we can then deal with the strike, if
there is one. In three days it'll all be over—three days at the
outside!”

“Ah, but in the workshop today they got round the women so
well that a lot of them are on their side now,” said Ah Chen,
pursing her lips. Kuei Chang-lin immediately knit his brows
in a worried frown. He had never had much influence with the
workwomen, and the little footing he had recently acquired among
them was due entirely to Tu Wei-yueh’s efforts. Tu Wei-yueh’s
shrewd eyes saw through him at a glance; he snorted contemp-
tuously and despised him for being such a broken reed. He re-
turned his gaze to the uncouth Pockmarked Li, with his glaring
eyes and his tightly-clenched fists, the undisguised and distinc-
tive badges of his kind, indicating that he was ready to fight for
whoever would pay him. Tu Wei-yueh was satisfied with this
man. He took a step forward, so that he was standing right
under the light, and said to Ah Chen:

“So the women believe what Chien Pao-sheng tells them, eh?
Now, Ah Chen! Don’t tell me that you with your smooth tongue
can’t beat Hsueh Pao-chu! And can’t Yao Chin-feng go one bet-
ter than Chou Erh-chieh? If those two can pull the wool over
the women’s eyes, why can’t you two do it as well? If the work-
women don’t yet realize that Chou Erh-chieh is one of Chien Pao-
sheng’s cat’s-paws, why should you imagine that they know you’re
on our side? It’s not as if you've got the word ‘spy’ branded

on your forehead! Surely you can easily unmask Chou Erh-chieh
and let them see her for what she is? Now off you go, Ah Chen,
and tell Yao Chin-feng what’s got to be done. Get around among
the women and stir them up against Chien Pao-sheng, Hsueh
Pao-chu, and Chou Erh-chieh. Don’t worry about them going
on strike tomorrow! Now look snappy! Later on I'll get some
others to back you up. You'll get a first-class ‘merit’ for it!”

“Who do you think cares a straw for your ‘merits’? I’m doing
my job and I'll be satisfied if everybody plays fair!”

Ah Chen stood up, and as she went out she threw Tu Wei-yueh
a deliberately disdainful look. Tu Wei-yueh stood with his head
on one side for a moment, thinking; then he stepped up to Pock-
marked Li, clapped him on the back, and asked in an undertone,
“Look here, old man! Can you round up twenty of your lads for
tonight?”

“You bet!” said Pockmarked Li, leaping to his feet, his face
glowing with joy and his saliva generously splashing Tu Wei-
yueh’s face. “Twenty, you say? Easy get you fifty if you like!”
Tu Wei-yueh smiled.

“Excellent! Though twenty’ll do for tonight. I want them to
walk around the women’s huts—get it? Just walk around and
not get involved in any quarrels. There are just two girls I
want shadowed—Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin—Chang Ah-
hsin’s the girl with a flat face and big breasts; know the one I
mean? And I'll want your twenty chaps back here at the fac-
tory tomorrow morning. What’s the work? Let you know in the
morning. And now go round to Mr. Mo and take a hundred
dollars. All right, that’s all.”

Only Tu Wei-yueh and Kuei Chang-lin were left in the room
now, and for a while neither of them spoke. The thunder rever-
berating across the sky was louder now, but more leisurely, like
the subdued rumble of a night-soil cart on its early-morning
rounds. There was a flash of lightning every two or three
minutes, but it was no more than a brief flicker. The wind was
rising now, and the lights hanging from the ceiling were swing-
ing in the breeze. Outside the windows it was pitch dark. Tu
Wei-yueh glanced at his watch: it was just on half past seven.

“Mr. Tu, if we have a strike and it drags on a long time, I
think we'll probably be the losers,” Kuei Chang-lin said slowly

and quietly, and with a tone of ill-concealed pessimism in his
voice. “Those three new men in the general office—Tseng, Ma,
and that distant nephew of Mr. Wu's—they’re all running you
down behind your back. Seems to me they’re well in with Chien
Pao-sheng.”

Tu Wei-yueh shrugged and smiled. He was afraid of nothing.
Narrowing one of his beady eyes, Kuei Chang-lin went on in a
dismal voice, “You forgot to warn Pockmarked Li not to let on
in front of Ah Hsiang. That was a mistake. I've always
suspected that this fellow Ah Hsiang is spying on us for Chien
Pao-sheng. Though Pockmarked Li is very thick with him.”

“Chang-lin, you’re too timid ever to make a go of anything
big! We're hard pressed for helpers just now, and so we'll just
have to take certain chances. Don’t worry about Ah Hsiang: I
can take care of him all right! The real difficulty lies with the
women. I’ve given the Old Man my word that I’ end the strike
within three days if it comes, and that I'll make a clean sweep
of all the trouble-makers at the same time, so that there won't be
any more strikes for the next six months. So we'll let them go
on strike tomorrow—anyway, we couldn’t stop them even if we
wanted to—but I've decided that we shouldn’t use force tomorrow.
We'll give them their heads for a couple of days, so that they'll
have plenty of time to finish off Chien Pao-sheng and his lot, and
then we'll settle their hash in no uncertain manner! So you see,
Chang-lin, you'll have to put your best foot forward and work the
majority of the women round on to your side.”

“Shall I tell my people to pretend they’re against the wage-
cut, then?”

“Yes, of course. We'll settle Ho Hsiu-mei and her lot first, and
then we'll be able to kid the women into going back to work;
after that we can talk terms with them. I’m perfectly certain
Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin are the trouble-makers, but there
must be others besides, and it’s up to us to find out who they are.
I’m giving you the job of finding out, Chang-lin, and I want you
to report back to me tomorrow.”

As he said this, Tu Wei-yueh glanced at his watch again, then
dismissed Kuei Chang-lin and left the office himself.

Flashes of lightning lit up the dark, cloudy sky, whose uniform
leaden gloom had by now broken up into patches of black and

grey. Great, solid banks of cloud, anvil-topped, towered up like
a range of mountains, black at the bases and grey at the sum-
mits. The thunder was now even louder than before. Tu Wei-
yueh cut across an open space piled high with wooden boxes
and came to a small building. This was the office where Wu
Sun-fu interviewed his office staff when visiting the factory. It
was normally unoccupied, but just now glimmers of light showed
through the cracks of the tightly-closed slatted shutters. When
Tu Wei-yueh pushed the door open and went in, the two people
in the room stood up. He smiled and signed to them to sit down
again and asked one of them, who was Wang Chin-chen, fore-
woman No, 2:

“Have you told her yet?”

“No, we've only just this minute arrived, and I thought you’d
like to speak to her yourself, Mr. Tu,” replied Wang Chin-chen
mysteriously. She winked at Tu Wei-yueh and stood up as if to
go, but Tu Wei-yueh waved her back to her seat, at the same time
turning to look at the young factory girl who sat there very
ill at ease. She was a girl of about twenty with bobbed hair
and of middling height. Her skin was dark, but she had a lovely
complexion and lively, sparkling eyes. She blushed hotly under
Tu Wei-yueh’s compelling gaze.

When he had stared at her for a while he smiled and said
gently, “Chu Kuei-ying, you’ve been here for almost two years.
You’re very good at your work and you're well-behaved. I’ve
mentioned your name to the proprietor, and we're thinking of
making you a forewoman. This will be a special promotion in
your case, as I expect you'll appreciate.”

Chu Kuei-ying did not reply, but sat with crimson cheeks and
downcast eyes. Her heart was pounding and her mind was in
a whirl, for when Wang Chin-chen had gone to fetch her she
had only told her that she was wanted in the office, and she had
supposed that she was going to be on the carpet for expressing
her opposition to the wage-cut before she knocked off work,
and that some informer must have reported her. Now it turned
out that they wanted to promote her, and she did not know what
to think. Besides, this man in charge of the factory, Tu Wei-
yueh, had once been in the habit of pestering her with his atten-
tions at every opportunity, so perhaps he was just trying to get

round her by doing this. When this thought struck her, she felt
more tongue-tied than ever. Now Wang Chin-chen put in a word
to help persuade her.

“Mr. Wu is really being very fair and Mr. Tu is trying to
help you, too, but they wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t that you deserve
it, Kuei-ying!”

“Wang Chin-chen’s right, you know,” said Tu Wei-yueh in the
same gentle voice, while his keen eyes looked her up and down.
“Mr. Wu’s a fair man and he’s very considerate. He often says
that if it had not been for the drop in silk prices, which meant
that he would make a loss, he would gladly have agreed to a
cost-of-living allowance last time. And if it were not for the
fact that prices have recently dropped even lower, the idea of
a wage-cut would never have entered his head! Although he’s
making a loss, Mr. Wu still sees to it that those who work hard
and behave themselves are fairly treated. That’s why you're
getting special promotion!”

Although Chu Kuei-ying still hung her head, she was con-
scious of his eye on her. When she had finally made up her
mind, she looked up, her face now white, and said quietly but
firmly:

“Thank you very much, Mr. Tu, but this sort of thing is not
for me!”

Just then there was a flash of lightning and a sudden crash
of thunder right overhead which seemed to shake the room.

Tu Wei-yueh winced, but whether because of the sudden noise,
or whether because of her reply, it was not clear. Knitting his
brows, he tipped Wang Chin-chen a wink. She nodded and
pulled a face, then slipped quietly out. Chu Kuei-ying immedi-
ately stood up, but Tu Wei-yueh stopped her.

“Mr. Tu! What do you want me for now?”

“What's the hurry? I’ve got something more to tell you yet—”

Chu Kuei-ying blushed furiously. She was now quite certain
that he was out for a spot of philandering. She had not dis-
liked him before when he had been a junior clerk in the factory,
but ever since his promotion to his present position as the most
powerful man in the office she had felt as if a high mountain
had sprung up between them, and had been very ill at ease at

having to talk with him more than she could help. And now he
had tricked her into coming here, and was refusing to let her go!

“I don’t want to hear it!” she said, fixing him with a stare
and standing her ground. “You can have me into the office
tomorrow and tell me then!”

“You needn’t be afraid,” he said with a sardonic smile. “I
always behave myself with women: I don’t flirt with them and
I don’t take advantage of them! All I wanted was to find out
why you don’t want to be promoted to forewoman. We're not
expecting a lot of you—all we want you to do is to help us with
something. All you’ve got to do is to tell me which of the girls
have anything to do with those dubious characters, the Com-
munists. Don’t worry, I won’t let on that you told me. Why,
I’ve even sent Wang Chin-chen away!”

He said this in the same gentle undertone, but it came as a
great shock to Chu Kuei-ying, and the colour drained from her
cheeks. This was something even worse than the philandering
which she had expected. She simply loathed him now.

“I don’t know what you're talking about!” she said, dashing
past him and straight out through the door. She heard Wang
Chin-chen’s voice calling after her, and then a shout from Tu
Wei-yueh as if he was telling Wang Chin-chen to be quiet. With
never a look behind her, Chu Kuei-ying raced round the work-
shop and made for the main gate.

About fifteen yards from the gate was the gloomy row of sheds
where the cocoons were stored. Just as Chu Kuei-ying was run-
ning past this place, a flash of lightning suddenly lit up every-
where as bright as day. There was a crash of thunder overhead,
and as the thunder broke someone sprang out on her and threw
his arms round her in a tight embrace. It all happened so sud-
denly that the strength went out of her limbs. Her heart pounded
wildly and she was too stunned to cry out until the man had
already dragged her several paces away with him.

“Help! You—” she shouted as she began to struggle with
him, thinking it was Tu Wei-yueh. But the noise of the thunder
as it rumbled across the sky drowned her voice. Suddenly, another
flash of lightning flooded the scene with a glare of white light,
and she was able to see that it was not Tu Wei-yueh at all! At

this juncture, someone else, a hurricane-lamp in his hand, came
running towards them, shouting:

“What do you think you’re on?”

It was Tu Wei-yueh’s voice. Chu Kuei-ying’s attacker now let
go of her and turned to slip away, but Tu Wei-yueh grabbed him
with one hand and lifted the light to his face with the other: it
was Tseng Chia-chu. Tu Wei-yueh scowled and fixed him with a
contemptuous stare. A long peal of thunder came echoing across
the sky. Tu Wei-yueh released Tseng Chia-chu and turned to look
at Chu Kuei-ying, a cynical smile on his lips.

“If you don’t want to help me that’s all right by me,” he said,
his tone as polite as ever. “There’s no need to go running away
like this. How do you imagine you can get past the watchman at
the main gate if you’re on your own? You'd better go out with
Wang Chin-chen.”

He then called Wang Chin-chen over to escort her, and went
back the way he had come.

*

When Chu Kuei-ying reached her “home,” it had already started
raining, and heavy, scattered drops were pattering against the
bamboo door. The little thatched hut was in darkness except
for a glimmer of light from a neighbour’s lamp filtering through
a crack in the clay-plastered party-wall. When she had recov-
ered her breath, she became aware that groans were coming
from the rickety bamboo bed—her mother.

“What's the matter, Mum? Are you ill or something?”

Chu Kuei-ying went across to her mother and laid her hand
on the old lady’s much-wrinkled forehead. For a moment the old
lady seemed glad to see her daughter, then suddenly she burst
into tears. Chu Kuei-ying took no notice, for her mother often
cried like this. She heaved a sigh and her thoughts returned
to the nightmarish: events of that evening and the rumour of
an impending twenty per cent wage-cut. Her heart was ablaze
with anxiety and hatred. After a moment her mother cried out
in a voice choked with sobs:

“Kuei-ying, these days... there’s only one way out for poor
people like us...and that’s to die!”

Chu Kuei-ying stared dazedly at her mother for a moment, but
said nothing. The only way out is to die? Chu Kuei-ying realized

full well that they were on the verge of destitution, but she was
a young girl of nineteen, toughened by a life of Poverty and
hardship, and she had no intention of just giving up like that and
dying—as a matter of fact, she believed that she had a right to
a decent life, like anyone else. She patted her mother’s chest
and asked in a soothing voice, “What’s the matter, Mum?
Business bad today?”

“Business bad? Ah! You know very well it’s always the same,
Kuei-ying. Every day business is so bad it makes me cry. But
today... just look at my basket over there!”

The old lady suddenly boiled over: she hauled herself painfully
up and sat there, her lips pressed together, fuming with
indignation.

Chu Kuei-ying picked up out of the corner the wicker basket
from which her mother peddled peanuts. She found that the
rim had been torn away, so that it was now useless, and that it
was quite empty. She tossed it aside and puffed out her cheeks
with annoyance.

“I suppose you’ve been quarrelling with somebody, eh, Mum?”

“Quarrelling? As if I would! It was some bullying devil —
blast him!~—came and set on me for no reason at all! He snatched
my basket, took my peanuts and threatened to run me in!”

“But what should anybody want to do a thing like that for?”

“He said I was—oh, I can’t remember what it was now!—Have
a look at them papers there! He said I’m breaking the law
having them!”

She had stopped crying now, and the more she spoke the more
excited she became. She groped on the table for a match and
lit an oil lamp. Chu Kuei-ying looked in the bottom of the basket
and saw a few small sheets of paper with something printed on
them in red. It was the paper her mother used for wrapping
up her peanuts. She remembered that Sze Hsi-tse, the rag-and-
bone boy from next door, had picked up a thick wad of these
sheets of paper somewhere in the streets a couple of weeks before,
and that her mother had given him some peanuts in exchange
for some of it for wrapping-paper. How could she be breaking
the law by using it? She picked up a sheet and looked at it
closely; three of the signs on it looked rather familiar. She
thought for a moment and then she remembered: they stood for

“Communist Party.” She had often seen these words scrawled
on the walls beside the factory gate and on telegraph poles by
the roadside, and her brother Little San-tse had told her what
they stood for. And then this was what Tu Wei-yueh had asked
her about when he had sent for her a short while ago.

“And I’m not the only one who uses that sort of paper,” the old
lady complained indignantly, her lips trembling as she spoke.
“Old Pah the cooked-beef man uses it, too. And then—”

Chu Kuei-ying was shrewd enough to guess that it was a case
of some tramp roving the streets looking for a free meal anc
finding a pretext to do himself a good turn. She tossed the sheets
of paper aside and fell silent for a moment, then picked up the
basket again to see whether it could be mended and used again.
Suddenly she looked worried; she let the basket fall to the mud
floor and put her head on one side to listen.

A hubbub of argument and angry words was coming from the
neighbours in the next hut—girls working in the same factory
as Chu Kuei-ying. The hiss of the rain on the bamboo doors was
louder and more insistent than ever and overhead the rumble of
thunder still rolled across the sky, but the sound of voices which
rose from the huts was even flercer than the angry roar of the
storm. Doors groaned on their hinges as people went in and
out of the huts, and the whole settlement of workers from the
silk factory was a hive of activity. While one storm raged
overhead, another kind of storm was about to break in this little
shanty-town!

Chu Kuei-ying was becoming restless, and she had just sprung
to her feet to go out when the bamboo door of her own hut
creaked open and in burst a skinny youngster in a blue jacket.
swearing at the top of his voice:

“That perishing old swine of a boss we've got! He’s got plenty
of money to throw around on whores and gambling and building
posh houses! But when it comes to paying out wages and keep-
ing his factory going, he makes out he’s broke! Rotten old
bastard!”

This was Chu Kuei-ying’s brother Little San-tse, who worked
jn a match factory. Too excited to pay any attention to his
mother and sister asking him what it was all about, he raved
angrily on:

“We used to get sixty cents a day; in the spring it was cut down
to fifty cents; and now today, if you please, that old perisher
Chou Chung-wei sticks up a notice about ‘high costs’ or some
such nonsense, and saying he’s losing a lot of money so he’s got
to cut us down to forty cents!”

As he spoke, Little San-tse picked up the box of matches on
the table and slapped his hand against it.

“Two coppers a box he gets for these, and he tells us he’s losing
money! —Give me eight coppers, Kuei-ying: I want to get some
scones for my supper. The blokes in the factory are having
a meeting tonight, and I’m going along with Chin Ho-shang from
next door. If that old swine Chou’s going to cut our wages down,
we're bloody well going on strike!”

When the old lady realized that they were going to have
another wage-cut at the factory where her son worked, she felt
disaster had finally overtaken them. By the time the full re-
alization of it had come home to her, Little San-tse had gone.
After a moment Chu Kuei-ying followed him out. The pelting
rain felt cool and pleasant to her face. She was seething with
rage and indignation and her face was so hot that it seemed
as if the raindrops would dry as soon as they touched it.

Outside the bamboo door the ground was strewn with rubbish
washed down by the heavy rain. A flash of lightning Hit up the
huddle of huts, and in the brilliant white glare she could see a
number of people hurrying through the downpour. When the
flash had passed the darkness seemed blacker than ever. Chu
Kuei-ying’s destination was the east end of the slum, about fif-
teen yards away. She was going to the “home” of Chang Ah-hsin,
one of the girls she worked with, to tell her how Tu Wei-yueh
had sent for her and tried to pump her about the people who
were mixed up with the Communists. At this moment her
thoughts were moving faster than her feet. She had almost
reached Chang Ah-hsin’s hut, when in the darkness she suddenly
felt somebody’s arms round her.

“Kuei-ying!” cried a voice in her ear, and as she recognized
it Chu Kuei-ying’s heart began to beat less violently. It was
Chin Hsiao-mei, one of the girls who worked in the same factory.
She was only thirteen, but was much older in the head. She was
the younger sister of Chin Ho-shang, one of Chu Kuei-ying’s

neighbours. Gripping Chu Kuei-ying’s arm, she asked, “Where
are you going?”

“To Chang Ah-hsin’s place.”

“It’s no good going there: they’ve all gone over to Yao Chin-
feng's. Come on, let’s go over together.”

The two girls retraced their steps and turned left. As they
walked along, Chin Hsiao-mei poured out all the latest news,
and as she listened Chu Kuei-ying glowed with excitement, so
that she forgot that it was raining and that her clothes were wet
through. So Yao Chin-feng is out to lead us again! Then Hsueh
Pao-chu must have been wrong when she accused her of being
a spy for the boss. Who else? Chou Erh-chieh and Chien Chiao-
lin? Well! But Chien Chiao-lin is Chien Pao-sheng’s sister, isn’t
she? And now even she’s having a go! Fancy that! So the
workers are ready to help their mates after all!

Soon they were approaching Yao Chin-feng’s home. This was
also a straw-and-mud affair but cleaner than most and boasting
a wooden door. While they were still some distance away they
could hear a babel of voices from inside. Chu Kuei-ying’s heart
leapt for joy. The last meeting—when they had decided to
“go slow”’—had been nowhere near as noisy and daring as this:
it had been held in secret, and very quietly.

Chin Hsiao-mei dashed forward to open the door, and as Chu
Kuei-ying squeezed in she was met by a breath of hot, close air
and the reek of sweat. The room was packed and everyone
seemed to be shouting at once. An oil lamp shed a pool of light
no more than a few feet square, and in this pool of light was a
plump white face with drooping eyelids—Chien Chiao-lin, of all
people!

“Tt’s all the fault of Kuei Chang-lin and Chamber-pot Tu!”
she was shouting, while a teardrop oozed out from under one of
her drooping eyelids. “They’re always crawling round the boss!
We must strike! We must strike tomorrow! We've got to beat
these two crawlers!”

“Strike! That’s right: strike! There’s several factories in
Hongkew already out!”

“Shouldn't we send somebody to get in touch with them—?”

“When they come round and burst into the factory tomorrow,
we'll down tools and march out!”

From this medley of voices Chu Kuei-ying could only identify
that of the last speaker—Hsu Ah-yi, a woman in her thirties who
was ordinarily timid and quiet.

“Sling Chamber-pot Tu out of the factory!—And Kuei Chang-
lin with him!” bawled dumpy little Chou Erh-chieh, poking her
head out from behind Chien Chiao-lin, but immediately another
voice shouted:

“Sling Chien Pao-sheng out, as well! We don’t want a trade
union that’s out to swindle us! We want a trade union of our
own!”

A deathly hush suddenly descended on the room, and sweat-
beaded faces peered this way and that to see who had spoken. It
was Ho Hsiu-mei, her face flushed and her staring eyes fixed on
Chien Chiao-lin. Almost at once the tense silence was broken,
and Yao Chin-feng’s little oval face with its faint white pockmarks
flashed in the dim pool of light from the oil lamp.

“That’s right!” she shrilled. “Sling Chien Pao-sheng out and
sling his stooge out with him! Chou Erh-chieh’s his stooge!”

“You bitch! You’re Chamber-pot Tu’s stooge yourself!”
screamed Chou Erh-chieh. She sprang up and flew at Yao Chin-
feng, and for a moment the two of them struggled together. The
girls came to Yao Chin-feng’s rescue and parted them. As they
hustled Chou Erh-chieh away into a corner, they all shouted
at her:

“The one who starts a fight first is always in the wrong!”

“Listen, girls!” panted Yao Chin-feng. ‘When I say that Chou
Erh-chieh is Chien Pao-sheng’s stooge, I know what I’m talking
about! He’s sent her here to spy on us!”

She ran her eyes over the circle of faces to see what effect her
accusation would have. All at once pandemonium broke out
again and it was impossible to hear what anybody was Saying.
One thing, however, was clear to everybody: Chou Erh-chieh was
up to no good at this meeting! Chang Ah-hsin’s voice alone could
be heard shrilling above the din.

“Chien Chiao-lin’s here to spy on us, as well! She can’t be
any good if she’s Chien Pao-sheng’s sister! Throw her out!”

“She's always flirting with that new fellow Tseng!” cried an-
other voice. “And he’s the boss’s cousin or something!”

All was confusion now, and if at this moment Chou Erh-chieh
or Chien Chiao-lin had shown the slightest sign of protest, they
would have been beaten up. Taken completely unawares by this
sudden attack, they did not know quite what to do for a moment.
One thing was clear to both of them: it would be unhealthy
to stay just now. At the first opportunity they slipped out.
This gave Chu Kuei-ying a chance to edge further into the room,
and she almost managed to get through to Chang Ah-hsin.

“They've got away!’ shouted the timid Hsu Ah-yi at the top
of her voice, trying to push her way through the crowd. ‘“They’re
sure to go and report us! We'll have to break up straight away!”

They all heard what she said, but no one agreed.

“No, no, don’t break up yet! Don’t be scared! We haven’t
decided anything yet!”

“Pirst thing tomorrow morning, we should elect our represent-
atives and then walk out on strike!”

“And then we'll break into Wu Sun-fu’s new factories and make
the girls down tools and join us! We'll go round all the factories
in Chapei and make them all come out on strike with us!”

“I think we’d better send somebody round to see the strikers
in Hongkew first. If they'll come and break into our factory,
we'll shut down the machines and join them!”

This proposal to “wait and see” was made in an anxious voice
and came from a girl standing right beside Chu Kuei-ying. She
recognized her as Lu Hsiao-pao.

“Pah! Only a crawler would wait for a walk-in from outside!”
snapped Ho Hsiu-mei, and spat at Lu Hsiao-pao. Lu Hsiao-pao
stood her ground, and the two of them indulged in a brief slanging-
match.

The question was now whether they should wait for a walk-
in from outside or whether they should walk out themselves and
then break into the other factories, and on this point the eight
or so girls were divided into two groups; Ho Hsiu-mei, Chang Ah-
hsin, and one or two others, including Chu Kuei-ying, were for
walking out of their own accord, and in this Yao Chin-feng also
agreed with them. Each of the girls represented two or three
rows of girls in their workshops, so any resolution made this
evening could be carried out the next day. Hsu Ah-yi now urged
them once more:

“Come on, hurry up! They must have gone and reported us
by now. Somebody’s sure to come round!”

It was at this moment that Chin Hsiao-mei squeezed hurriedly
in through the crowd to say that she had just seen several
“toughs” walking up and down in the vicinity as if they were
looking for somebody. Everybody looked alarmed except Yao
Chin-feng, who knew what it meant as she had been told all
about it by Ah Chen. Nevertheless, she seized this opportunity to
suggest that they should close the meeting now and make the
final decision in the workshop next morning. Her “mission” was
accomplished, and she was anxious to dash off and report to Ah
Chen how she had got on at the meeting.

It was not raining so hard now, but it was chilly outside and
the girls shivered as they came out of the hut. Chu Kuei-ying,
Chang Ah-hsin, and another girl, Chen Yueh-ngo, went off arm
in arm and huddled close together. Chen Yueh-ngo whispered
in Chang Ah-hsin’s ear:

“Looks as if there’s really going to be a strike tomorrow! Ma
Chin’s still waiting for us to report back.”

“Let’s go there straight away,” replied Chang Ah-hsin, also in
a whisper. “Though it’s very cold, and we'll get wet through
again.”

Chu Kuei-ying overheard what they were saying, and it re-
minded her that Tu Wei-yueh had not long ago been offering to
promote her to forewoman to buy her over. She was just going
to tell her friends about it, when she suddenly caught sight of
an individual in a black gown slip out from a side-turning and tag
along behind them. She immediately nudged Chang Ah-hsin and
pointed over her shoulder with her lips. Chen Yueh-ngo spotted
him at the same time; she dug Chang Ah-hsin in the ribs with
her elbow and deliberately raised her voice:

“Br-r-r! Isn’t it cold tonight! Well, Ah-hsin, we'll have to say
good-night now. See you tomorrow!”

The three of them unlinked their arms and went off in three
different directions.

When she had gone a few steps, Chen Yueh-ngo turned her
head and stared hard over her shoulder: the black-gowned in-
dividual was following hard on Chang Ah-hsin’s heels. Her heart
missed a beat, for she knew that Chang Ah-hsin did not always

keep her wits about her. She immediately stopped and shouted,
“Ah-hsin! You've left your handkerchief in my hand!”

Chang Ab-hsin looked round and then she, too, saw the fellow
in the black gown behind her. She shouted back, “Keep it till
tomorrow,” and headed straight for home. He of the black gown
again emerged from the shadows and paced stolidly on behind
her.

When she had made sure that she herself was not being tailed,
Chen Yueh-ngo quickened her steps. Leaving the slum behind
her, she turned into a squalid alleyway. When she reached the
other end she tapped three times on the back door of a house
and she slipped quickly inside.

The front-room upstairs was furnished with three rickety beds
and one square table. Two girls with their hair cut short were
sitting hunched over the table, writing something by the dim light
of a solitary bulb hanging from the ceiling. Chen Yueh-ngo crept
in very quietly, but the two girls heard her coming. One of them
raised a vivid pair of eyes and greeted her with a stare, then
lowered her head and went on with her writing. As she wrote
she said to the other girl:

“you'd better hurry up and finish, Tsai Chen. Yueh-ngo’s here,
and it’s getting late, so we'd better start the discussion straight
away.”

“All right, let’s get started,” said the girl addressed as Tsai
Chen, stretching and putting down her pen. “We can finish the
writing off afterwards.”

She stood up and stretched again. She was taller than Chen
Yueh-ngo, and, like her, she wore a short white calico jacket and
a pair of baggy black slacks. She was dressed like one of the
girls from the silk factory, but her sophisticated expression and
manner proclaimed her to be an intellectual. Her eyes were
heavy for lack of sleep and her face was pale.

The other girl also stopped writing. Her sharp, vivacious eyes
flashed a glance at Chen Yueh-ngo as she asked quickly, “Well,
Yueh-ngo, how are things going in the factory? If you can get
things moving tomorrow, we've got a good chance of bringing
off a general strike involving all the silk factories in the Chapei
area.”

After a struggle, Chen Yueh-ngo managed to give some account
of what had happened in the factory during the day and at the
meeting a short while ago in Yao Chin-feng’s hut. Her diction
was of the simplest, but she larded it freely with some of the
jargon she had lately picked up—the women’s “spirit of struggle”
was running high; given “leadership,” there was no question of
their not being “mobilized” immediately. She was very excited,
and every now and then she interrupted her report to recover her
breath. Beads of perspiration glistened on her forehead.

“Same situation as in Hongkew,” commented Tsai Chen; then,
making a clean sweep of the questions left unanswered by Chen
Yueh-ngo’s report, she concluded briskly, “Your people must walk
out tomorrow without fail, and after that they must go round
bringing out the other factories until we’ve got a general strike
of all the silk factories in Chapei!’”

Her keen-eyed companion, Ma Chin, had made no comment,
but still watched Chen Yueh-ngo with an intense stare, as if
trying to detect any exaggerations the latter might be making
in her “report.” She had the feeling that there were some com-
plicated problems involved in the “report,” yet, not being a swift
thinker, she could not for the moment make an accurate analysis
of what these problems were—she just had a vague sense of
uneasiness.

Outside the window the rain was hissing down and the lightning
was flashing again. A tense silence hung over the room.

“Come on, Ma Chin, let’s hear your decision!’ Tsai Chen
urged impatiently, drumming her pen on the table. “We’ve got
other things to do yet.”

As Tsai Chen looked at it, the question was simple enough:
“the workers’ spirit of struggle was running high’ because the
“high tide of revolution” was at this moment sweeping the coun-
try! Since March, there had been strikes by the bus- and tram-
drivers in the International Settlement and by the workers in
the power-house in the Frencn Concession. The “spontaneous
struggle” of the workers had been kept up without a break in
factories all over Shanghai, and every “economic struggle” had
a way of turning instantly into a “political struggle,” with the
result that “the revolution had now reached high tide.’ Tsai

Chen had heard all this time and again from Ke Tso-fu and had
adopted it as her own formula for thinking.

This “formula” sounded simple, clear and “reasonable,” and,
along with a lot of other jargon, had been firmly memorized by
Chen Yueh-ngo and through her instilled into the minds of Chang
Ah-hsin and Ho Hsiu-mei, whose simple minds and warm hearts
were just the right sort of fertile soil for “formulas” of this kind.

Ma Chin, however, thought differently, she felt that there were
flaws in Tsai Chen’s “formula,” but, with her scanty knowledge
and experience, she was unable to explain just where—she just
felt it was so. Besides, it was not in her nature to make hasty
statements; she preferred to go over all the facts first. This was
the reason for her present hesitation about Chen Yueh-ngo’s
report. Now that Tsai Chen was hurrying her up, she just had
to express what she felt as best she could.

“There’s no point in rushing things. We must study the situa-
tion carefully. Yueh-ngo says Yao Chin-feng’s putting up a better
show this time, but don’t forget she wasn’t all that reliable last
time. Besides, she may be Kuei Chang-lin’s tool in the war be-
tween the yellow trade union factions. Maybe she’s wormed her
way in to win over the masses and lead a strike herself for her
own ends. I think we must take all this into consideration before
we can make a decision.”

“you're wrong!” Tsai Chen immediately expostulated. “The
fact is, the revolutionary spirit of the masses has put an end to
Yao Chin-feng’s wavering. What’s more, you're disregarding the
fighting spirit of the masses at a time when the tide of revolu-
tion is in full flood, you’re underestimating the power of the
masses to discipline wavering elements, and you think that the
tools of a yellow trade union can lead the masses! You're taking
a rightist view of things!”

As she reeled off her formulas and scraps of jargon one after
the other, her pasty face became flushed. Chen Yueh-ngo sat
listening, and although she did not understand much of what
Tsai Chen was saying, she was quite impressed by it.

Ma Chin also flushed and at once demanded, “What do you
mean, ‘rightist view’!”

“T mean that you doubt the great revolutionary power of the
masses and that you fail to see the upsurge of the fighting spirit

of the masses!” said Tsai Chen, glibly quoting another formula
Ma Chin’s face suddenly paled. She sprang to her feet and said
harshly:

“I’m not taking a rightist view! I’m only trying to analyse a
complicated fact. I suspect Yao Chin-feng of covering something
up with her leftist exhibition!’

“Well, have we got to stop rousing the masses to action just
because we're afraid that Yao Chin-feng might take over the
leadership from us, then? If that isn’t a rightist point of view,
what is it?”

“I didn’t say we’d got to stop activating the masses! All I’m
proposing is that we should decide our tactics before we begin
launching the masses into action.”

“What do you mean by ‘tactics’? So you're thinking of decid-
ing our tactics, eh? You're forgetting our general line! That’s
what you call rightist deviation!”

“Tm not going to start arguing with you about rightism and
leftism, Tsai Chen. All I’m concerned with is whether or not
we’re going to find ways and means of dealing with the two
yellow trade union factions and their stooges in the Yu Hua
Silk Factory.”

“Pooh! ‘Ways and means’? You’re not suggesting we should
play one clique off against the other? Why, that’s opportunism!
The one correct way is to go all out to raise the revolutionary
spirit of the masses to the utmost and provide correct leadership
for their great revolutionary power!”

“Yes, yes, I know all about that, but these theoretical problems
can be discussed later at a group meeting. What we've got to
discuss now is the practical side. Yueh-ngo’s waited long enough
for our decision. I propose that when we get the ‘strike going
tomorrow we should ask Yao Chin-feng to make up her mind
where she stands—”

“T think we can quite safely leave it to the masses to keep an
eye on her,” said Tsai Chen with casual confidence and a mocking
smile. In the ordinary way she had great respect for Ma Chin,
who was hard-working, unafraid of hardships, and correct in her
views; but at this particular moment she was beginning to have
her doubts about her—at least, she suspected Ma Chin of shrink-
ing in the face of the “high tide of revolution.”

“we needn't be afraid of Yao Chin-feng playing tricks,” Chen
Yueh-ngo chimed in. “The girls will make short work of any-
body they find ratting! Yao Chin-feng wouldn't dare risk it.”

Her patience was rapidly being exhausted, though mainly be-
cause she did not understand all these formulas and scraps of
jargon which Tsai Chen and Ma Chin were using. Nevertheless,
she was a factory worker with an ardent revolutionary spirit and
was very eager to learn all she could, so she continued to listen
patiently.

“T suspect that Yao Chin-feng has already ratted!—Oh, come
on, let’s stop arguing and decide what we’re going to do once
we've got the strike started.”

With this call for a truce in the interminable controversy of
formula versus formula, Ma Chin sorted through the papers she
had just been working on, picked up one of them and began
reading out the programme she had jotted down. The discussion
now centred on purely practical issues: the formation of a strike
committee and the nomination of committee members, terms
for the resumption of work, liaison with other factories on
strike in Chapei, contact with factories in Hongkew.... Now
that they were coming down to brass tacks, Chen Yueh-ngo joined
in the discussion instead of just listening to the other two. Each
of them had plenty to say and their faces were flushed with
enthusiasm.

Meanwhile the crash of thunder, the lightning and the tor-
rential rain raged through the night with ever-increasing fury,
until the house rocked precariously; but the three girls were
oblivious of all this, for they were completely engrossed in the
other storm that was coming.
XIV

W HEN the night of storm had passed, daybreak brought a gentle
breeze and scattered, rose-tinted patches of cloud, and the rising
sun was a blood-red disc.

The several hundred spinning-machines in the Yu Hua Filature
that had been running at full pressure suddenly stopped. The
thunder of the oppressed was being unleashed! The girls surged
out of the workshop like a tidal wave, swept across to the notice-
board in front of the office like an angry squall, scattered the
handful of clerks who had come out to see what it was all about,
and tore down the notice which had just been put up announc-
ing the wage-cut.

“Down with the blacklegs! Down with the crawlers!"

“Death to Chien Pao-sheng and Hsueh Pao-chu!”

“No wage-cut! We want Sunday overtime! We want a cost-
of-living allowance!”

Thundering their demands, the crowd of angry women spread
out in line and closed in on the office, which represented their
shackles — the shackles they were going to break asunder!

“Down with Chamber-pot Tu!”

“Sling out Kuei Chang-lin and Wang Chin-chen!”

The crowd was shouting raggedly now, instead of in chorus as
at first. The main body of the women had now surged forward
to the veranda in front of the row of office buildings, which they
had by now surrounded; but their progress was blocked by
Pockmarked Li and his twenty bullies, who were swearing at
them and threatening them with lead-weighted lengths of hose.
Among them was Ah Hsiang, who kept glancing at Pockmarked
Li to see what he would do. The latter, however, had not re-
ceived his orders to go into action, so they could only stand
guard and hold themselves in readiness.

Suddenly, Tu Wei-yueh’s slim figure made its appearance be-
fore the door of the office. He held himself erect, and his face
wore its customary sardonic smile.

The crowd was taken aback: he was certainly a game ’un, this
“Chamber-pot”! But their hesitation was momentary, and the
next instant they were surging forward with redoubled boldness,
until they were almost on top of Li’s strong-arm men. Their
shouting had risen to a deafening roar: they were angry, and
they were ready for a deliberate, all-out attack on their enemy,
a hand-to-hand encounter! Their smouldering anger had been
fanned into flame at last! One detachment of the crowd had
already poured on to the other end of the veranda. There was
a crash and tinkle of breaking glass. The first blow had been
struck! The crowd fanned out and moved in to the attack. Any
moment now the storm would break.

Pockmarked Li could wait no longer, and he and his twenty
men struck out wildly at the section of the crowd which was
closing in on them, though they retreated step by step as they
fought.

Tu Wei-yueh also stepped back. Suddenly, someone sprang out
from behind him. It was Wu Wei-cheng.

“Go on, Li, give em what for!” he yelled. “Give the bitches
a good hiding! Run ’em in!”

“Pitch into ’em!... Call the police! Open fire!” yelled two
other voices: Ma Ching-shan and Tseng Chia-chu were hanging
out of a window to shout encouragement.

Pockmarked Li and his men were still retreating, fighting as
they went. In the mélée several of the women had become caught
up in the middle of the bullies and were now trying hard
to fight their way out. The main body of the crowd had by
now got on to the veranda, and the office was on the point
of “falling”? at any moment. At this juncture, however, their
rear was thrown into confusion by the arrival of a dozen or so
policemen, who charged into the crowd, using their bayonets
to clear a way. Pockmarked Li and his men immediately took
the offensive, and the five or six women who had been cornered
were now seized by the bullies. The main body of the crowd
drew back slightly, and the policemen took up positions on the

porch.

Far from retreating, the women stood their ground, shouting
angrily and rallying for a second attack.

Wu Wei-cheng, Ma Ching-shan, and Tseng Chia-chu came
dashing out together and stamped their feet as they yelled at
the top of their voices:

“Open fire! Finish the bitches off!”

The crowd’s reaction was immediate: their ranks stirred and
they began moving forward with a deafening roar. The
policemen automatically raised their rifles. Suddenly, Tu Wei-
yueh stepped out again and stopped them with a wave of the
hand, at the same time shouting at the top of his voice:

“Don’t open fire!... Girls, listen to me! We're not going to
shoot at you! Just listen to me for a moment!”

“We don’t want to listen to your bluff! Clear off!” roared a
small group of women in the crowd, still moving resolutely for-
ward. But the majority stopped and stood still.

Tu Wei-yueh smiled calmly and walked out on to the steps in
front of the veranda.

“Now, be sensible,” he bellowed. “You don't imagine your
bare fists are going to be any good against guns and bayonets?
You swear at me and want to kick me out, but we’re all in this
together you and me. We all depend on the factory for a
living, and if you smash up the factory, you'll be taking the
food out of your own mouths! If you've got any demands, go
back and send a representative to discuss them with me. Now,
go on back! I’m the only one here still in favour of a peaceful
settlement! If you go on making trouble like this, you'll be
the losers by it!”

Suddenly, Kuei Chang-lin slipped out and went across to the
main body of the women, who were standing still and seemed
to have calmed down.

“Mr. Tu’s quite right!” he shouted. “Everybody go on back
now and leave it to the union to take the matter up with the
management! We won’t let you down!”

“We don’t want anything to do with your lousy union!” shrilled
a voice from the crowd. “We'll have a union of our own!”

By now even the small group of women had stopped, and a
confused jabber of voices rose from the main body of the crowd.
It was clear that they were no longer shouting for an attack,

but were busy arguing among themselves about what their next
step should be. All at once, one of the girls left the crowd to
address them. It was Yao Chin-feng.

“Listen, girls!’ she shouted. ‘“They’re holding half-a-dozen
of us! If they don’t let them go, we'll carry on to the bitter
end!”

The crowd’s response was a deafening roar. There was some-
thing else they wanted now! Yao Chin-feng took a step forward
and looked Tu Wei-yueh straight in the eyes:

“Let the girls go!”

“You can’t do that!” yelled Wu Wei-cheng as he and the
other two squeezed out to the front. Pockmarked Li looked
at Tu Wei-yueh, and saw that he was smiling his usual cold
smile. Quite firmly, Tu Wei-yueh gave Pockmarked Li his orders:

“Let them go!”

“They’ve let them go!” yelled Kuei Chang-lin at the top of
his voice, running round the main body of the crowd. “They've
let them go! Everybody can go back now! If you’ve got any
demands you can send up a representative to discuss them!”

The crowd cheered and the human tide began to move again,
but this time it had changed direction and was moving towards
the main gate. As she went along, Ho Hsiu-mei shouted, “Down
with Chamber-pot Tu! Down with Kuei Chang-lin!” but only a
hundred or so voices took up her slogan. Then: “Down with
Chien Pao-sheng!” shouted Yao Chin-feng, and this time the
whole crowd took up the cry. Chen Yueh-ngo and Chang Ah-
hsin walked along together, their jaws set firm. Chen Yueh-
ngo now recalled the argument between Ma Chin and Tsai Chen
the night before. She was afraid that the plan to march into
the other factories might now fall through.

Nevertheless, when the crowd had surged up to the gate-way,
and Chang Ah-hsin shouted, “March into the other factories!”
the crowd’s response was as deafening as ever:

“March into the other factories! Let’s break into the ‘new
factory’ first!”

“General strike! We want a trade union of our own!”

They thundered their way across the street and stormed into
Wu Sun-fu’s “new factory.” The workers of two factories
joined forces and marched into a third factory, then into a

fourth, swelling their ranks to two thousand, three thousand,
four thousand, five thousand, so that in less than an hour every
silk filature in Chapei, large or small, was out on strike. The
whole area was in a state of tension, and police patrols were
doubled.

The workshop of the Yu Hua Filature was as silent as the
grave. Four policemen had been posted at the main gate. In-
side the office, on the other hand, the atmosphere was unusually
tense. Wu Wei-cheng, Ma Ching-shan, and Tseng Chia-chu
were badgering Tu Wei-yueh and accusing him of being a weak-
ling. Tu Wei-yueh made no attempt to argue with them, but
just smiled his usual cool, unruffled smile.

A motorcar horn blared furiously from the main gate. Tu Wei-
yueh strolled calmly out of the office to find that Wu Sun-fu had
already got out of his car. His face was livid with fury and his
eyes blazed. He did not give anybody so much as a look,

Mo Kan-cheng stood to one side, his head drooping and his
face deathly pale.

Tu Wei-yueh squared his shoulders and walked across to Wu
Sun-fu with a cool, open smile.

Wu Sun-fu threw him a glance, then, without a word, beckoned
the two of them to follow him. He went first to look at the
broken office window, then made a tour of inspection through
the deserted workshop and every other part of the factory. When
he saw that no other damage had been done, his expression
gradually relaxed.

Finally, he went into his office and settled himself down to
hear Tu Wei-yueh’s report.

Golden sunlight was streaming in through the window, and a
golden-coloured electric fan was turning from side to side behind
Wu Sun-fu’s back. Dark shadows moved across the window as
some eavesdroppers strolled to and fro outside. Tu Wei-yueh
noticed them quite clearly as he made his report, and smiled
sardonically to himself.

Wu Sun-fu listened with his brows drawn together in a frown.
His lips were pressed tightly together and his keen glance darted
all round. Suddenly, he broke in with impatience, “Do you think

they'd dare smash the machines? Or set fire to the premises?
Or start a riot?”

“They're like a lot of raving lunatics at the moment, and I
wouldn’t put anything past them. Though it can’t last long: once
the crowds dispersed they’ll quieten down again.”

“In other words, you think we’re very lucky to have come
through it with nothing worse than a broken window, eh? That’s
what you'd call a victory for us, I suppose?”

There was an edge to Wu Sun-fu’s voice as he said this, and
his eyes glinted coldly. Tu Wei-yueh drew himself up and
smiled.

“] hear we've caught several of the rioters red-handed,” Wu
Sun-fu went on icily. ‘“You’ve turned them over to the police,
1 suppose?”

Tu Wei-yuch saw straight away what was behind this ques-
tion: he guessed that someone had already reported the girls’
release to Wu Sun-fu—and had done a lot more back-biting at
the same time, no doubt. He kept a straight face and said, “I’ve
already let them go.”

“What! Just let them go like that? And I suppose you did
that to save my factory, eh? Huh!”

“No, not at all! As you said yourself only the other day, ‘You
can’t net them all.’ Besides, there’s no point at all in detaining
half-a-dozen sheep who just follow the crowd.”

Sensing the second piece of sarcasm, Tu Wei-yueh paid Wu
Sun-fu back in his own coin. He threw out his chest and put
on a look as much as to say, “You can kill a gentleman but you
cannot insult him.” He knew that this was a good way of bring-
ing the violent, refractory Wu Sun-fu to heel.

For a while neither of them spoke. A shadow flitted across
the window again. This time Wu Sun-fu also saw it. He
frowned. He realized quite well what was going on, and he had
never liked this kind of sneaking, creeping monkey-business.
He laughed grimly and said in an intentionally loud voice:

“All right, Wei-yueh, I give you a free hand! But we're start-
ing work tomorrow! Got it? Tomorrow!”

“Pll do my best to carry out your instructions, sir,” replied
Tu Wei-yueh in an equally loud voice. He realized that his own
“régime” was safe again for the time being. Wu Sun-fu smiled

and waved him away, but as Tu Wei-yueh rose to go, Wu Sun-fu
suddenly said:

“T hear certain people in the factory don’t hit it off with you
Is that right?”

‘Who exactly are you referring to, sir?”

“People in the office, your colleagues.”

“Well, I don’t know anything about it. I can hardly imagine
anybody being like that. We all are working for you, Mr. Wu,
and you treat us all the same. Whatever authority you give me
is only so that I can carry out your instructions.”

Though he spoke calmly and unhurriedly, Tu Wei-yueh had a
sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He made a slight but
grave bow and left the room.

Mo Kan-cheng was summoned in next. As the old fellow
came into the room he was trembling at the knees. The moment
he clapped eyes on him, Wu Sun-fu felt a twinge of annoyance.
He deliberately avoided looking at the pitiful-looking old crea-
ture, and sat silent, his eyes fixed on the flickering patterns of
light and shade on the window. His mind was occupied with
the problem of Tu Wei-yueh: Surely the fellow couldn't really
be ignorant of the fact that certain people in the office were not
satisfied with the way he had handled things today? No! He
must know! But why wouldn’t he admit it? Was he afraid of
losing face? Pride, that was it! This young man did have plenty
of pride, too. Well, let’s wait and see how he acquits himself
today!... Suddenly, Wu Sun-fu was assailed by a doubt. He
shook his head vigorously, then turned to Mo Kan-cheng and
said in a harsh voice:

“Kan-cheng, you’re a senior member of the staff. When you
find these youngsters quarrelling, it’s up to you to sort things out
and make peace between them!”

“But sir—”

“Hold your tongue! You know very well I don’t like people
coming and whispering to me against this one and that. I’m
capable of making up my own mind, so I don’t need to listen
to gossip! I can see quite clearly who’s any good and who’s not,
and anybody who comes and blows his own trumpet to me is
wasting his breath! Understand? Go and tell them, then!”

“Very good, sir!”

“TI also hear that Tseng Chia-chu and Tu Wei-yueh are fighting
for the same girl, and that there was a little to-do here last night.
That true?”

“T,,,I don’t know much about it.”

Mo Kan-cheng was flustered, and his miserable expression was
almost laughable. As a matter of fact, he knew all about it,
but he was afraid to say anything with the echoes of Wu Sun-fu’s
harangue still ringing in his ears. Realizing what was worrying
him, Wu Sun-fu laughed despite himself and went on, “What do
you mean, you don’t know much about it! Can’t you even
answer a straightforward question when I ask you? I know
just what you people in the office are like: you've got no
ears for anything decent: all you’re ever interested in is bits of
scandal. The minute there’s some rivalry over a girl, your ears
start flapping. I hear Tu Wei-yueh’s to blame in this case. He
sets a bad example, doesn’t he?”

Mo Kan-cheng just stood and gaped wide-eyed. For a moment
he could not make up his mind what to do: should he confirm
what Wu Sun-fu had said? Or should he tell the truth? In the
end, he decided to tell the truth. After all, Tu Wei-yueh still
enjoyed Wu Sun-fu’s confidence.

“Mr, Wu, the fact of the matter is, young Mr. Tseng’s really
gone too far—”

Wu Sun-fu nodded and smiled, and Mo Kan-cheng felt en-
couraged to go on. “Wang Chin-chen, forewoman No. 2, saw it
all with her own eyes. All I know is what she’s told me: Mr.
Tu hasn’t mentioned a single word to me about it yet. Last night,
Mr. Tu sent Wang Chin-chen to fetch one of the girls—Chu Kuei-
ying—up to the office to ask her which of the girls had anything
to do with the Communists—as a matter of fact, they were in
this very room, and Wang Chin-chen was here, too. Afterwards,
when Chu Kuei-ying was leaving the factory, she had just got
to the cocoon-store, when young Mr. Tseng stopped her and
started annoying her. We didn’t hear her shouting or anything,
because it was in the middle of a thunderstorm, but Mr. Tu and
Wang Chin-chen happened to run into them and saw what was
happening. Well, that’s the long and the short of it.”

Wu Sun-fu knit his brows in silence. He could see it all now.
He realized that the account his nephew Wu Wei-cheng had

given him of things was a completely distorted one. It suddenly
struck him that it had been a mistake to put three of his rela-
tives—Tseng Chia-chu, Ma Ching-shan and Wu Wei-cheng—in
the same factory: there would be no end of trouble from them!

“I see! Now, Kan-cheng, go and tell everybody in the office
that there’s to be no more gossiping about it!”

With this, Wu Sun-fu waved Mo Kan-cheng away. He tilted
his head on one side and thought for a moment, then picked up
a pen with the intention of writing a memorandum about trans-
ferring his three relatives to three of the factories run by the Yi
Chung Trust Company. You can’t run a factory properly when
it's chock-full of relations and old friends! With this thought, he
set to work on the memorandum, but he had hardly begun when
he was interrupted by an uninvited visitor—his nephew Wu Wei-
cheng.

“Who sent you here?” he snapped irritably, throwing the pen
back on the table. “Mo Kan-cheng?”

He glared sharply at Wu Wei-cheng’s rather intelligent-looking
face. Closing the door behind him, Wu Wei-cheng remained on
the other side of the room away from the desk. His manner was
calm and self-possessed as he spoke:

“I’ve got something to tell you, Uncle.”

Wu Sun-fu frowned, but let him go on.

“Chien Pao-sheng’s just told me that the girls had a meeting
last night in one of the girls’ homes—Yao Chin-feng’s. When
the girls rioted today, she was one of those who wanted to smash
up the office. She was also the one who shouted to the crowd
to fight it out if we refused to release the six girls that we’d ar-
rested. It was this same girl, Yao Chin-feng, who was the back-
stage ringleader when we had that trouble in the factory a month
ago. They say that Tu Wei-yueh managed to buy her over after
that, but the meeting last night was actually held in her hut!
She’s very radical and I’m sure she’s still a secret ringleader.”

Wu Sun-fu was watching his nephew’s face intently. He
smiled faintly, but said nothing. He had already heard from Tu
Wei-yueh that Yao Chin-feng had been present at the girls’ meet-
ing the night before, so he had learned nothing new from what
Wu Wei-cheng had told him. Nevertheless, the mention of Yao
Chin-feng’s name aroused some association in his mind. He re-

membered that she was a woman of about thirty, tall and slim,
with a small oval face faintly marked by smallpox. He also re-
membered that after Tu Wei-yueh had bought her over there had
been a slight hitch: one of the forewomen, Hsueh Pao-chu, had
given the game away—though the trouble had been smoothed out
afterwards.

“So far as I can see, Uncle, this present trouble is the result
of Tu Wei-yueh’s connivance. He could easily have done some-
thing to prevent it yesterday, but he didn’t. And then this morn-
ing, all he did was to play the kind good-hearted mediator! He’s
in league with that trade union fellow Kuei Chang-lin to win
the girls over between them!”

Wu Sun-fu’s expression changed abruptly: he was hearing
something “new” after all! However, after a moment’s thought
he quickly pulled himself together and put on a serious expres-
sion, then banged his fist on the desk and shouted (though with-
out conviction):

“I’m surprised at you, Wei-cheng! I’ve given Tu Wei-yueh full
authority to manage the factory for me, and I don’t need any ad-

vice from you!... What you've just told me is private, so don’t
breathe a word of it outside! Understand? All right, you can
go now.”

Having waved Wu Wei-cheng away, Wu Sun-fu picked up the
memorandum he had been writing, glanced at it, then slowly
crumpled it into a ball, hesitation and indecision written all over
his face. All of a sudden, he leapt abruptly to his feet, smoothed
out the crumpled sheet of paper, and read it through once more;
then, with a shake of the head and a snort, he tore it up and
threw it into the spittoon. He had finally reversed his decision
not to have his relatives in his own factory. He snatched up his
pen again and began making out a notice:

The present reduction of wages has been dictated by the
pressure of circumstances, and as soon as the price of silk
begins to return to normal the original wage-scale will, of
course, come into force again. All employees are strongly
advised to return to work without delay, and not allow
themselves to be led astray by undesirable elements and so
get into trouble. For some time now, the management has

borne with patience the continued feud between trade union
factions. Let it be clearly understood that, in the event of
further attempts to sow dissension and foment unrest among
the workers, the management will have no alternative but
to take drastic action.

Having given the notice to Mo Kan-cheng to put up, he left
the office. Just as he was getting into his car, he turned round
to give Tu Wei-yueh his final warning:

“T don’t care how you do it, I want the women back at work
tomorrow!”

At one o’clock in the afternoon, Tu Wei-yueh was pacing to
and fro in his office, now smiling grimly, now drawing his brows
together in a frown. The reason for this nervous anxiety was
that he was now on the borderline of success and failure. That
morning, when the strike had begun, he had been confident that
he would win, for all the shouts of “Down with Chamber-pot
Tu!” With the arrival of Wu Sun-fu on the scene, however, his
confidence had given way to doubt. Even though Wu Sun-fu had
repeatedly assured him that he was giving him an absolutely free
hand, he had not been slow to grasp the implication that the “free
hand” would only be his until “tomorrow.”

If he couldn’t bring the strike to an end the following morning,
there would be no question of his fate—the sack!

It had been obvious to Tu Wei-yueh for some time that Wu
Sun-fu had not been able to make up his mind from the very
beginning. He was also fully aware of the difficulties involved
in working for a man who, like Wu Sun-fu, was normally ob-
stinate and ruthless, but who had given way to doubt and in-
decision.

Suddenly, a shadow flitted across the window. Tu Wei-yueh
at once stopped and went to see who it was, then hurried out.
It was Kuei Chang-lin. The two men exchanged glances, but
said nothing, then walked together into Mo Kan-cheng’s office,
where they found several people, including Mo Kan-cheng, sitting
and waiting quietly.

With a rueful smile on his lips, Tu Wei-yueh glanced round
the room and began:

“Mr. Wu's orders are that the women should go back to work
tomorrow without fail, which only leaves us this afternoon and
this evening to arrange things. This morning we tried to get
the women to send a representative to talk things over, but we
didn’t have any luck. They refuse to recognize the existing trade
union, and they’ve now set up a strike committee. I sent Kuei
Chang-lin to negotiate with the strike committee, but they say
they’re waiting for orders from the silk filatures general strike
committee. They’re just being bloody-minded about it! I don’t
think we should concern ourselves with this so-called ‘general’
strike committee, but get on with stopping the strike in this fac-
tory alone. The most important thing at the moment is to get
them back to work tomorrow by hook or by crook! Even if we
only get them working at half-pressure, it'll be something to
show to Mr. Wu. Chang-lin, do you think we'll be able to get
them back to work tomorrow? What actually is it that they’re
demanding?”

Kuei Chang-lin did not reply at once. He glanced from Tu
Wei-yueh to Mo Kan-cheng, then shook his head and sighed.

“T give up! I’ve been run off my feet since yesterday evening
trying to bring about a peaceful settlement and save people’s
face all round, then somebody goes running to the boss behind
my back and turning him against me! You ask me to come
along and give my opinion, Mr. Tu. If I don’t say what I think,
people will say I’m being paid for doing nothing; if I do say what
I think, people will say that I’ve got an axe to grind or that I'm
having a go at somebody. Mr. Mo, don’t you see what an
awkward position I am in?”

Silence fell upon the room. Tu Wei-yueh was frowning un-
happily and gnawing his lips. Mo Kan-cheng looked flustered.
Ah Chen, sitting in the corner, was smiling surreptitiously behind
her hand. She nudged Wang Chin-chen, who was sitting beside
her, and then threw Tu Wei-yueh a sidelong glance. They both
knew only too well what was upsetting Kuei Chang-lin. Pock-
marked Li, however, was becoming impatient.

“you’ve only got to give us the word, Mr. Tu, and we'll go
straight in and finish the job!”

“phat’s right! put in Wang Chin-chen. “You've only got to
tell us what you want done, Mr. Tu! But, Chang-lin, let’s hear

what it is you've got to say, so that we can decide what to do
about it.”

As she said this she kept her eye on Mo Kan-cheng, who some-
how knew what was coming. Tu Wei-yueh nodded slowly, look-
ing first at Pockmarked Li and then towards Kuei Chang-lin.

“All right, then,” the latter began hesitantly, “I'll say what I
think’s right. The girls know very well the boss is losing money.
They also understand perfectly well what he said on the notice
-—he’s had to cut their wages because he’s not getting enough for
his silk, and he’s going to reconsider later on. Now this strike’s
about two things: it’s half because of that wage-cut and half be-
cause of certain people they don’t like. Hsueh Pao-chu’s too dom-
ineering, and the girls hate her like poison. And then there’s
Chien Chiao-lin and Chou Erh-chieh; they’re another thorn in
everybody's side. If you want to make sure of getting the girls
back to work tomorrow, you'll have to keep these three out of
the way for a few days.”

As he spoke, Kuei Chang-lin looked steadily at Mo Kan-cheng’s
startled face. Every now and then Tu Wei-yueh also ran his
eye over Mo Kan-cheng’s face, and by the time Kuei Chang-lin
stopped, all eyes were turned to the old man. Mo Kan-cheng
felt flustered, but did not lose his sense of proportion. He was
always careful to steer a course between the two sides. He could
not afford to risk being suspected of supporting the other side, so
he hastened to ingratiate himself with this side.

“Yes, you're quite right!—Provided they do go back to work
tomorrow!”

Tu Wei-yueh smiled sardonically, for he knew that this ex-
change had paved the way nicely for him and that he could now
proceed, without any further delay, to give them the instructions
he had already worked out in advance. His face became sud-
denly grave as he raised his hand and motioned them to pay
attention.

“We can’t afford to worry about how certain people are going
to take it,” he began grimly. “If we’ve found a way to get the
girls back to work tomorrow, then it’s up to us all to do what’s
right and get on with it! Ah Chen, did you get in touch with
Yao Chin-feng? Have you found out who’s on this strike com-

mittee, or whatever it is, besides her? Which of the committee
members get on well with her?”

“There's no need to ask who the others are! Ho Hsiu-mei,
Chang Ah-hsin and that crowd, of course! There’s two that I
know of who’re on good terms with Yao Chin-feng: Hsu Ah-yi
and Lu Hsiao-pa2o.”

As she spoke, Ah Chen pouted out her lips and gave Tu Wei-
yueh a sidelong glance. The eternal flirt. Tu Wei-yueh sud-
denly lost this temper.

“You're always bungling, Ah Chen! We must know exactly
who these people on the strike committee are! Wang Chin-chen
can help you. First you can tell Yao Chin-feng to round up Hsu
Ah-yi and Lu Hsiao-pao, and tell them they'd better watch their
step, because Ho Hsiu-mei and ail that bunch are Communists
and the police are going to arrest them! If the girls don’t turn
up at work tomorrow, Mr. Wu will be anything but gentle to
them! If they’ve got any demands to make, they can do it after
they’ve gone back to work. Then you can get all the forewomen
together and go round the huts in ones and twos and tell the girls
to call off the strike and not to be taken in by the agitators!”

“But we can’t do that!” Wang Chin-chen and Ah Chen pro-
tested in unison. “Anybody who goes round the huts at a time
like this is just asking for a good hiding!”

“What are you afraid of?” Tu Wei-yueh snapped impatiently.
“You can always hit back, can’t you? I suppose you'll be want-
ing bodyguards next! All right, then: Li, you’d better call up
your men to keep an eye on them.”

Ah Chen crimsoned and was going to argue, but Wang Chin-
chen tugged at her sleeve and stopped her. Ignoring the two
girls, Tu Wei-yueh turned to Kuei Chang-lin:

“What's this so-called general strike committee they’ve got?
And who’s behind it pulling the strings?”

“The Communists, of course! Just making the most of a chance
to stir up trouble! There’s over a hundred factories, big ones and
small ones, out on strike now in Hongkew and Chapei. They’ve
got a general headquarters—in some hotel or other, so they say
—though I can find out all about it this evening.”

“It'll be too late by then! We must have the information this
afternoon! Though I’ve got another urgent job for you in the

meantime, Chang-lin. The girls are so sure of themselves only
because there are so many of them out on strike, and if the
strikers in the other factories around don’t go back to work to-
morrow, we’re going to have a job to persuade our girls here to
go back. What I want you to do, Chang-lin, is to go round the
local factories and talk the managements into making tomorrow
the deadline for the end of the strike. Tell them to use force
to make them go back, and get more policemen in! If there’s
any picketing at the gates, the pickets must be arrested!”

“That’s the stuff!” broke in Pockmarked Li quickly, hearing
that force was to be used. “That’s just what we ought to do at
this place, Mr. Tu! I’ve just been waiting for a chance to stop
their little game once and for all!”

He slapped his thighs with his huge paws. He was a rough,
simple-minded fellow, and he had been trying to puzzle out all
the morning why Tu Wei-yueh would not use force. But for
his “loyalty” to Tu Wei-yueh, he too would have joined in the
back-biting. Unable to contain himself any longer, he had stated
his own view of the situation and now looked up as obediently
as ever into Tu Wei-yueh’s face.

Tu Wei-yueh gazed back at Pockmarked Li with a faint smile
—it may have been a smile of sympathy, or it may have been
one of approbation. Then he said to Pockmarked Li in a tone
of voice that was a mixture of coaxing and peremptoriness:

“Don’t worry, Li, old chap. Sooner or later there’ll be plenty
of work for your fists, but don’t forget: a good fighter doesn’t
have to get the first blow in! Besides, our factory's different from
the rest: there are so many difficulties involved that if we just
plunge in without getting a clear picture of the situation first,
we'll quite likely end up by making things worse than they are
now. Mr. Wu's always given us plenty of rope, so it’s up to us
to do things as he wants them done. See what I mean, Chang-
lin? Let our neighbour kill a chicken as a warning to our

monkey!”
“Just you leave it to me, and I’ll make a good job of it.”
“Good!... Now, Mr. Mo,” said Tu Wei-yueh grimly, turning

abruptly to Mo Kan-cheng, “I’d like you to put up a notice straight
away dismissing Chien Chiao-lin, Hsueh Pao-chu, and Chou Erh-
chieh.”

Pockmarked Li and the two women were rather surprised
at this. They had hardly expected, when it had been suggested
that these people should be “kept out of the way for a few days,”
that they would be dismissed just like that. When they looked
at Tu Wei-yueh and saw the glint of firmness in his eyes, they
realized that his decision was irrevocable. So that was the end
of Chien Pao-sheng and his bunch!

It had come as something of a shock to Mo Kan-cheng, as well.
He looked at Tu Wei-yueh’s forbidding expression and said noth-
ing for a moment. After a while he scratched uneasily at his
cheek and said hesitantly, “Couldn’t you save Hsueh Pao-chu’s
face a bit by asking Mr. Wu to transfer her to one of his ‘new’
factories?”

“That’s a matter for Mr. Wu's kind-heartedness,” replied Tu
Wei-yueh coldly. “It’s no concern of ours. All we’re concerned
with here is putting up the dismissal notice!”

He turned from Mo Kan-cheng to the other four and went on
grimly, “You all know that Hsueh Pao-chu and the other two
were the first to stir up the girls against the wage-cut in the
workshop yesterday afternoon. They’ve never tried to work con-
scientiously in this factory, and they seek every opportunity to
settle their personal grievances by playing off the women against
Kuei Chang-lin! But they’re such nasty pieces of work at the
best of times that, however much they try to get round the girls,
the girls will still hate the three of them like poison. If we’re
now giving them the sack, it’s not because we want to gain any
personal advantage: it’s because one, they're trouble-makers, and
two, it’ll give the girls a chance to let off steam —once they’ve
got rid of these three they'll go back to work! Mr. Wu Sun-fu
won't let me resign, so I'll have to carry on—though it'll mean
I’m going to upset some people. I hope I can rely on you people
to give me your full support, so that we can get everything prop-
erly arranged tonight to ensure that the girls go back to work
tomorrow without any fuss or trouble. — Though once they’re
back I’m going to hand in my resignation once more!”

Mo Kan-cheng and the others exchanged surreptitious glances,
but no one said anything.

“We haven't a moment to lose,” said Tu Wei-yueh, then sternly
gave his final order: “Right! All of you go and put your backs

into it and report back to me by five o’clock!... Li, P’ve got an-
other job for you.” He signed to Pockmarked Li to follow him
and left the room. The latter made a grimace at the two women
and gleefully hurried out behind Tu Wei-yueh.

Tu Wei-yueh stopped when he got to the end of the veranda
which ran along the front of the office buildings. Pockmarked Li
hurried up and stood in front of him, his lips parted in an elated
grin to reveal his large teeth. Part of Tu Wei-yueh’s face was
in the sun and showed smooth and shiny while the rest of it was
in shadow and had a rather pallid appearance. He tilted his head
in thought for a moment, then turned his keen eyes on Pock-
marked Li and asked in a whisper:

“Haven’t you found anything out yet, tailing them all this
time?”

“No, not yet. The only people those two have had any con-
tact with are other girls from the factory. We've kept tabs on
both of them, but they never went outside the slum.”

“You don’t mean to say they know they’re being shadowed?”

“No fear of that! All my blokes are old hands at the game:
you wouldn’t find them giving themselves away!”

“Any strangers been seen?”

“No. The only people that Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin
ever see are girls from the factory.”

Tu Wei-yueh cast another sharp glance at Pockmarked Li, then
tilted his head on one side and closed one eye. He was fairly
certain in his own mind that Pockmarked Li’s men were too
stupid and clumsy not to have given themselves away. He had
long been aware that Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin had some-
thing up their sleeves, He slewed his eyes round to Pockmarked
Li again and went on:

“Who was with them when they left Yao Chin-feng’s hut last
night?”

“Er—last night? Well, Ho Hsiu-mei and Lu Hsiao-pao were
walking along together quarrelling. Chang Ah-hsin went off
with two other girls and before they’d gone very far they split
up and went three different ways.”

“And what about the other two—were they from the factory?
Do you know their names?”

“They were factory girls all right. They’d just been to the
meeting at Yao Chin-feng’s place. I didn’t see them myself, but
some of my men did. One of them was of middling height, round
face, bright eyes, darkish skin. The other one was a bit taller,
but they didn’t remember exactly what she looked like.”

A cold smile suddenly appeared on Tu Wei-yueh’s lips. Round
face, bright eyes, darkish skin, of medium height: he knew who
that was.

“Did they talk on the way?”

“Didn’t I just say: they split up before they’d gone very far.
The three of them were walking along arm in arm like the best
of friends.”

Pockmarked Li seemed to be getting impatient. He wiped his
mouth with the back of his hand and looked at Tu Wei-yueh with
staring eyes.

A shadow flitted across the corner of the wall, Tu Wei-yueh’s
sharp eyes had not missed it, and he at once stepped forward to
see who it was. It was Ah Hsiang, a new “recruit” to whom Tu
Wei-yueh had not yet entrusted any important mission. When
he saw Tu Wei-yueh, he stopped. Tu Wei-yueh frowned briefly,
then called out to him:

“Ah Hsiang! All the forewomen have gone down to the huts
to persuade the girls to go back to work tomorrow, because Mr.
Wu’s put up a notice promising to talk things over with them
once they’ve gone back. I want you to go and keep your eye
on them and see that all of the forewomen have gone down. If
you find that any of them haven’t gone, come back and report
them to me.”

“Tf there’s any trouble, let them have it,” added Pockmarked
Li. “Just shout if you want any help! We've got the whole
place surrounded!” He opened his mouth wide and laughed. Tu
Wei-yueh smiled briefly, but his expression immediately became
serious again as he turned back to Pockmarked Li:

“We're going down there, too—to look for somebody. I want
half a dozen of your chaps to go with us.”

Now that he was quite sure that the dark-skinned, good-looking
Chu Kuei-ying was mixed up in the plot, Tu Wei-yueh had de-
cided to go and investigate in person.

As they made their way down to the slum, they found the
whole area alive with policemen and militiamen patrolling in
pairs, while small knots of factory girls buzzed excitedly by the
roadside. Their faces shiny with perspiration in the broiling sun,
they swarmed noisily up and down, fearless and excited. As
they neared the slum, they felt a growing tension in the air. The
girls were swarming and humming like mosquitoes at dusk.
They were discussing the dismissal of the three girls from the
factory. A voice rang out clear above the din: “No mention
of the twenty per cent wage-cut? They’re trying to diddle us!”

With Pockmarked Li and his bullies in tow, Tu Wei-yueh now
entered the slum. His lips were set in his usual sardonic smile,
but his face was pale and he could feel countless hostile eyes
watching him from all sides. “Look, the Chamber-pot!” “Let's
get him!” The voices were subdued and sporadic at first, but
they became louder and louder as more girls took up thecry. Tu
Wei-yueh cast a furtive glance at Pockmarked Li and saw that
his face was dark and his jaw set firm.

The bullies were now moving about in twos and threes among
the knots of girls, looking for all the world like so many black
beetles in their black gowns or black silk jackets. These hench-
men of Pockmarked Li’s were deliberately barging into the cat-
calling groups of girls and clawing at their breasts through their
tight, sweat-soaked jackets. Every now and then there would be
a little skirmish and shouts would be exchanged, but in a few
seconds it would be over. The girls were trying not to be in-
volved in a full-blooded fight with the bullies, and the latter
were holding their fire until they received the order to lash out
in earnest.

Tu Wei-yueh kept his head down and hurried on, while Pock-
marked Li led him to Chu Kuei-ying’s hut.

“Look out! Chamber-pot Tu’s coming to get us!”

The sudden shout came from the doorway of a hut. The next
moment a little girl darted out. It was Chin Hsiao-mei, the little
factory-hand who lived in the next hut to Chu Kuei-ying. Pock-
marked Li snorted angrily and rushed forward to grab her with
his rough, grimy paw, but she was too nimble for him: she
ducked and dodged out of the way, then ran for dear life.
Tu Wei-yueh signed to Pockmarked Li not to pursue her, and

the two of them turned and charged into Chu Kuei-ying’s hut,
leaving the bullies outside to keep watch.

When Tu Wei-yueh’s eyes had got accustomed to the gloom
inside the hut, he saw Chu Kuei-ying standing in front of him,
her blazing eyes riveted on his. Her oval, olive-skinned face
was suffused with anger and her little lips were bloodless. There
were only the three of them in the hut: Chu Kuei-ying, Pock-
marked Li and Tu Wei-yueh. For a moment there was a tense
silence, while outside the hut a babel of voices was gradually
rising like a tide, louder and louder.

Forcing a smile, Tu Wei-yueh broke the silence. “Chu Kuei-
ying, it’s been reported to me that you’re a Communist. There
are two ways open to you, and it’s up to you to choose: either
you tell me about the other Communists you go with, in which
case you'll be promoted forewoman, or else you don’t tell me,
in which case you'll go to jail.”

“I’m not a Communist and I don’t know any Communists!”

“Ah, but I know all about it, you see! Besides you there’s
Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin....”

Chu Kuei-ying’s heart missed a beat, and a slight change came
over her face. Tu Wei-yueh saw it quite clearly. He smiled
and pressed her further. “And now you're going to tell me who
else there is besides those two!”

“J tell you I don’t know any Communists. You can take me
to the police station if you like, but I'll still say the same thing!”

Chu Kuei-ying’s expression was a little calmer now, though her
lips were paler still and her bright eyes were ablaze. Tu Wei-
yueh gave a derisive snort, then suddenly swung round to Pock-
marked Li and rasped:

“Search the house!”

By now the sound of angry voices outside had become louder
still. A din of shouting and cursing suddenly broke out, then
stopped abruptly, only to be replaced by the swish and thud of
bamboo and wood on human flesh, voices snarling through
clenched teeth, blood-curdling howls, and a sudden rush of feet.
Then, unexpectedly, a roar of triumph as a crowd of angry
women burst into the hut and hurled themselves straight at
Tu Wei-yueh and Pockmarked Li. In the ensuing silent scuffle

in the darkness of the hut the plank table and the rickety bamboo
bedstead were both overturned.

Tu Wei-yueh wielded a bench as he fought his way out
through the tangle of bodies, but just as he got to the door a
second wave burst into the hut and cut off his retreat. The din
from the crowd outside was deafening. Tu Wei-yueh was now
wrestling frantically with two of the girls. In the confusion he
caught a clear glimpse of one of them: it was Chang Ah-hsin.
All of a sudden Pockmarked Li grabbed hold of a girl in both
hands and used her as a battering-ram to clear a way through
to Tu Wei-yueh. The girls surrounding Tu Wei-yueh abandoned
him and turned their attention to Pockmarked Li. Tu Wei-
yueh saw his chance to escape and dashed out of the hut only
to be caught up in another crowd. Fortunately for him, these
were not infuriated girls, but a dozen or so of Pockmarked Li’s
bullies fleeing before a veritable deluge of women close on their
heels. When they reached the narrow street running alongside
the slum, the girls caught up with the bullies and another rough-
and-tumble broke out. The shrill screech of police-whistles sud-
denly pierced through the din and the white of police cap-bands
mingled with the girls’ flying hair.

Bang! Bang! Warning shots passed over the heads of the
crowd.

Pockmarked Li had also escaped from the hut, and still had
hold of the same girl. He smirked at Tu Wei-yueh.

Bd

Ten minutes later all was quiet again in the vicinity of Chu
Kuei-ying’s hut. The muddy ground was littered with splinters
of bamboo, and in the middle lay a night-stool brush which had
been used as a weapon. The bamboo door of the hut had been
damaged and now hung askew like the broken wing of a bird.
Down at the east end of the slum, however, a noisy crowd had
gathered on a rubbish dump: the girls were holding a meeting.
What few policemen there were, were watching from a safe
distance. Half a dozen or more of Pockmarked Li’s henchmen
stood scattered around the policemen.

The meeting had been called on the spur of the moment and
was over in no time at all. It had been called just in time to

catch the women’s will to fight at its zenith, Tu Wei-yueh’s
swoop on the slum soon had its effect on the struggle among the
women themselves.

“Chamber-pot Tu’s a twister!” shrilled Chang Ah-hsin. She
was addressing the meeting from the top of a rubbish-heap and
gesticulating wildly. “He only gave Hsueh Pao-chu and the
other two the sack so that he can trick us into going back to
work! Hsueh Pao-chu and the other two girls have been going
against him, so he has to find an excuse to get rid of them! And
then he comes down here with Pockmarked Li to round us up!
Down with Chamber-pot Tu, I say! No going back tomorrow!
Anybody who goes back’s a rat!”

A thunderous roar broke from the crowd at this:

“Anybody who goes back’s a rat!”

“Anybody who tries to get us to go back is a rat, too!”

“Give Yao Chin-feng a good hiding! She's a rat!”

“If they cut down our wages, we’d rather die than go back!”
continued Chang Ah-hsin. “We demand that Chamber-pot Tu
be slung out! And Kuei Chang-lin with him! Get rid of Wang
Chin-chen, Pockmarked Li, Ah Chen, and Yao Chin-feng, and
bring back Ho Hsiu-mei! We want,...”

She stopped, too hoarse to shout any more. Suddenly, she
clapped her hands to her stomach and doubled up, then sank
on to her haunches. Immediately, another girl sprang up to
take her place. It was Chen Yueh-ngo. She had two bloody
weals across her face from when she had fought with Tu Wei-
yueh. In a voice which was even louder than Chang Ah-hsin’s
had been, she shouted:

“We must reorganize the strike committee! We must throw out
Yao Chin-feng, Hsu Ah-yi, and Lu Hsiao-pao from the committee!
They want us to go back tomorrow, so we should throw them
out neck and crop!”

“Chuck ’em out!” was the ear-splitting reply from the crowd.
Suddenly, Chang Ah-hsin leapt to her feet, her face suffused
with a dark flush, and shrilled at the top of her voice:

“We mustn’t go back until the general strike committee tells
us to! Now listen, girls! A representative of the general strike
committee has got something to say to you!”

A sudden silence fell upon the crowd. A representative of
the general strike committee? Who was it? Where was she?
The women’s faces, bathed in sweat and flushed with excite-
ment, turned from side to side as they craned and peered to
see who it was, and a hum of conversation rose from the crowd.
After a moment, a young woman dressed like a factory girl,
with large eloquent eyes, scrambled up on to the rubbish-heap
and stood between Chang Ah-hsin and Chen Yueh-ngo. It was
Ma Chin.

“Sisters! A hundred and two silk factories in Shanghai are
out on strike together! It was you who were brave enough to
give the lead! The rats and blacklegs in your factory may fight
among themselves, but they’re still united when it comes to
oppressing you and swindling you! The only way you can achieve
victory is to rely on your own strength alone! Throw out the
rats and blacklegs, and organize your own trade union! And
don’t go back till the general strike committee tells you!”

“No going back till we’re told!” shouted Chang Ah-hsin and
Chen Yueh-ngo, giving the crowd a slogan.

“No going back till we’re told!” echoed the closely-packed ranks
of the crowd. It was almost literally an echo, in fact. Although
Ma Chin had done her best to “purge” her speech of formulas
and jargon, it was still an “intellectual's” speech and so it had
not made an immediate appeal to the girls’ hearts.

“Don’t forget, girls!” shouted Chen Yueh-ngo. “We've got to
stick together! No going back! No going back!... Meeting
closed!"

So saying, she jumped down from the rubbish-heap, followed
by Chang Ah-hsin and Ma Chin. The crowd broke up and
drifted away, shouting slogans as they went. Before long, a
squad of armed policemen on motorcycles arrived from the
police station, followed by a large force of foot police, but the
girls had already dispersed and all they found was an empty
rubbish dump. All the police could do was to post a guard over
it to stop the girls holding another meeting there. The Chinese
section of Shanghai had been under martial law for the last
Month, and meetings were absolutely prohibited.

ok

Yao Chin-feng and Ah Chen had already scurried back to the
factory to give Tu Wei-yueh a detailed report of the meeting.
They ended by clamouring for protection.

Tu Wei-yueh frowned, but said nothing. He had never ex-
pected that, after all the trouble he had taken to cultivate these
contacts among the women, they would now prove useless. He
had once thought that he would not have to devote more than a
third of his energies to dealing with the girls, but he realized now
that he would have to devote his last ounce of energy to dealing
with them.

“Miserable, scatter-brained creatures!” he muttered viciously to
himself through clenched teeth. ‘Seems a good hiding’s all they'll
understand! I’ll give them ‘Chamber-pot Tu’!”

With this he left the two girls and went through into the front
office. He was met by an agitated Mo Kan-cheng, who button-
holed him and stammered excitedly:

“1... I say, Wei-yueh! I was j—just looking for you! Mr.
Wu's been on the phone and he’s in a—a terrible rage! Will
they ... will they go back to work tomorrow, after all? D’you

think they will?”

“Pm sure they will!”

Tu Wei-yueh was as resolute and confident as ever, and a
cool smile played around his lps. Mo Kan-cheng half closed
one eye and gave him a puzzled look.

“Mr, Wu’s coming over straight away.”

“what for?” asked Tu Wei-yueh in a low voice, shrugging
his shoulders, then quickly put on a grim look and roared:

“what the hell’s happened to Wang Chin-chen and the rest
of the useless crew? You can never find them when you want
them! Send somebody out to look for them, Mr. Mo, When
they come, tell them to wait for me in your office. And please
be quick about it!”

So saying, Tu Wei-yueh stalked quickly away before Mo Kan-
cheng could get another word in. He went first to the main gate
to see how things were there. The iron gate was closed fast and
four policemen stood on guard. Pockmarked Li and his bullies
were roving about the place. Some of them were squatting on
the steps in front of the cocoon-store, looking like defeated game-
cocks. When he saw Tu Wei-yueh, Pockmarked Li hurried across

to him and said quietly, “Chien Pao-sheng’s lot were in that
fight just now. Did you know?”

“How do you know?”

“Ah Hsiang told me.”

Tu Wei-yueh gave a derisive snort, narrowed his eyes at the
sky for a moment, then looked back at Pockmarked Li again.
“Now [li need fifty men. Go and round them up straight away,
Li, and have them wait here till I tell you what to do.”

Leaving the main gate, Tu Wei-yueh walked off to inspect the
side gates and the rear gate. By this time he had made up
his mind what he was going to do, and now headed back towards
the office. When he got there, he found Wu Wei-cheng, Ma
Ching-shan and Tseng Chia-chu whispering together on the
veranda. He gave them a casual glance, then suddenly changed
direction, slipped round the back of the office buildings, and made
his way to a waste-store next to the boiler-house. He went in.

Squatting on the floor, her hands tied behind her back, was
Ho Hsiu-mei. When she saw that it was Tu Wei-yueh, she quickly
averted her face and jerked herself furiously round away from
him.

He smiled sardonically and began looking her carefully up and
down. For a while he remained perfectly quiet and said nothing.
Suddenly, Ho Hsiu-mei cast a furtive glance over her shoulder
as if to see whether he was still there or not. As it happened,
her eyes immediately met his, still cold and hard. Unable to
restrain himself, Tu Wei-yueh burst out laughing.

“Ho Hsiu-mei,” he said. “Just wait patiently a little longer.
After six o’clock, when we've finished discussing terms with
your representatives, we'll let you go.”

Ho Hsiu-mei started at him in silence. This time she did not
turn her head away.

“The representatives are Lu Hsiao-pao, Yao Chin-feng, and
somebody else...a friend of yours...Chang Ah-hsin!”

Ho Hsiu-mei gave a start and a look of surprise came into her
face. She continued to stare at Tu Wei-yueh, as if waiting for
him to go on.

“Now Chang Ah-hsin knows which side her bread is buttered.
I’ve had a sincere, heart-to-heart talk with her, and now she’s
come to see sense. She was quite frank with me, and she’s told

me everything. You've got a good, loyal friend there. She gave
me her word that you’re a good girl, really, but she says you're
young and don’t know any better, so that you’ve played into the
Communists’ hands. That’s right, isn’t it?”

Ho Hsiu-mei gave a frightened yelp and her face turned deathly
pale. Her terrified eyes were riveted on Tu Wei-yueh’s.

“And then there are the other girls in your little group. They’re
all good friends of yours, your ‘comrades,’ aren’t they? Yes,
Chang Ah-hsin told me all about it! But don’t worry, I’m not
yoing to have them arrested. I’ve always got on very well with
you girls! Ill tell you what, though: if the police ever find
out you’re in with the Communists, you'll be arrested and shot.
Now just think, Ho Hsiu-mei: some of your friends must be
sensible girls that we can talk round. If you can think of any,
I'll be only too willing to help them out.”

“Oh, Ah-hsin! Ah-hsin!”

Ho Hsiu-mei shuddered as she moaned these words, then let
her head slump forward, heart-broken. Tu Wei-yueh gnawed at
his lip and smiled, then stepped forward, bent over her, and
began in what sounded like a thoroughly sincere tone of voice:

“you shouldn’t blame Ah-hsin! Don’t blame her! If you just
stop and think about for a moment, you'll understand what it’s
all about. Look at the many strikes in Shanghai: they were all
started by Communists. But who goes to prison in the end?
You workers, of course. Meanwhile, the Communists themselves
are sitting pretty and taking things easy in their big, modern
houses. Every time you go on strike, they put in a nice big claim
for expenses and go and have a good time on the proceeds. Take
that girl student, for instance—the one that’s been leading you
and Chang Ah-hsin on. Now you never knew where she lived,
did you? I'll tell you: she lives in a big luxurious modern house!
Though when she comes to a meeting, she has to change into
shabby old clothes. And every time she comes over here for a
meeting she gets ten or twenty dollars for her fare, whereas
you girls have to go on your two feet! She lives in this big,
modern house and even her maids are better off than you girls
will ever be! Chang Ah-hsin ran into her one day and found out
what she was really like. So what did she do? Slipped Ah-hsin
a five-dollar note and told her to keep her mouth shut! Though

hasn’t Ah-hsin told you all about this herself? She’s not being
quite honest with you if she hasn’t. However, she’s been a very
good friend to you, and she swears you're all right!”

Ho Hsiu-mei hung her head in silence. Suddenly, she burst out
crying. It was like a little child crying. Then, abruptly, she
forced herself to stop and raised her tear-stained face to look at
Tu Wei-yueh. She stared and stared, and all the time the corners
of her mouth twitched, as if she was torn by some inner conflict
which she could not resolve. Noticing the twitching of her lips,
and realizing what it meant, Tu Wei-yueh put on as sympathetic
an expression as he could, and pressed home his advantage.

“Don't worry, Ho Hsiu-mei! It won’t be long now before we
let you go home. Now that we’ve dismissed Hsueh Pao-chu,
we need another girl to take her place. I’m thinking of recom-
mending you to Mr. Wu for promotion to forewoman. Then
we'll all get on very well together, with no more quarrels, and
everything’ll be all right!”

Ho Hsiu-mei’s face crimsoned, and tears suddenly started from
her eyes, though her sobbing had stopped.

“But Hsiu-mei, can’t you think of any of your friends who
would listen to good advice? Now think hard, and we'll go and
talk them round.”

Ho Hsiu-mei suddenly went in to a trance. Her head bent in
thought, she mechanically twisted the tail of her jacket between
her fingers. After a moment she sighed and murmured: “You'll
have to ask Chang Ah-hsin. She knows more about it than I
do.”

It was all she cculd find to say. She hung her head again and
trembled slightly. When he saw that he would not get anything
out of her, Tu Wei-yueh shrugged his shoulders, inwardly despis-
ing this useless Communist. With a contemptuous glance at her,
he turned on his heel and stalked out. His spirits were buoyant
as he walked back to the office. He found Ah Hsiang standing
idle in front of the veranda and gave him a job:

“Ah Hsiang, go down to the huts and persuade Chang Ah-hsin
to come up here with you. If you can’t coax her, bring her by
force. And be as quick as you can about it.”

Just then, a car drove into the factory. Wu Sun-fu’s bodyguard
Kuan jumped out and held the door open, and Wu Sun-fu himself

clambered out. Seeing Tu Wei-yueh coming across to meet him,
he said:

“Things are getting worse and worse! I just don’t see how you
can ever get them back to work tomorrow.”

“Mr. Wu,” said Tu Wei-yueh with a bow, “the night is some-
times darkest just before daybreak—no stars, no moon.” His
voice was perfectly calm and confident. Wu Sun-fu forced a
brief smile and began pacing along the cinder path on which
his car was parked. After he had gone a few steps he swung
round to Tu Wei-yueh, who was following him.

“So you're sure about it, eh? All right, then perhaps you'll
just tell me how you're going to go about it?”

His voice was just a little too genial, and Tu Wei-yueh suddenly
felt uneasy. He was afraid this might be the prelude to an
unpleasant scene. After a moment’s hesitation, he ran briefly
through the principal developments to date; as he spoke, he
scanned Wu Sun-fu’s face carefully. The light of the low,
westering sun lit up one side of Wu Sun-fu’s face, so that it ap-
peared shiny and colourful by contrast with the other side, which
was in shadow. The antithesis of light and shade might have
been symbolic of the two sides of his character. Tu Wei-yueh
relaxed a little now and gazed up at the eastern sky, where
vast heaps of flaming cloud hung over the horizon.

“So the girl you’ve caught, this Ho—er—Ho Hsiu-mei, is going
to be released, then, eh?”

‘Not till it gets dark, and when she is released she'll be
shadowed. I think we'll be able to net the whole bunch of them
this time.” The shadow of a smile flickered round his lips as
he said this.

“All right, do it your way and we'll see what happens. In
the meantime, Wei-yueh, make an announcement that tomorrow’s
the deadline for the end of the strike! Those who don’t go
back tomorrow will be sacked!”

Suddenly, Wu Sun-fu was seized with a fit of exasperation.
Without waiting for Tu Wei-yueh’s reply, he scrambled back
into the car. His bodyguard settled himself in beside the chauf-
feur, and the car moved slowly off. The big iron gates were
swung right back to let it through, while Pockmarked Li super-
vised the operation in stentorian tones. The car had only got

half way through the gates, when a great roar went up outside,
and a crowd of girls surged forward and blocked its path.
Immediately, the whole area of the main gate was thrown into
confusion. The policemen, followed by Pockmarked Li and _ his
bullies, came rushing up to clear the way, but all the time more
and more girls came flocking in until the crowd was twice, three
times, four times, five times its original size. The road outside
the gate was now completely blocked and there was no hope of
ever getting the car through. Inside the car, Wu Sun-fu’s heart
was pounding violently.

“Let Ho Hsiu-mei go, and we'll let you go!” shouted the girls,
as they burst through the cordon of policemen and bullies and
made straight for the car. They were quite unarmed, but their
determined onslaught made them more terrifying than if they
had been armed to the teeth.

The bodyguard, Kuan, leapt out on to the running-board of
the car with a murderous expression on his face and pulled
out his gun, The girls did not budge. Then, from the back of
the crowd, stones and clods began sailing over, though they went
wide of the mark. The girls were providing themselves with
weapons now, but apparently they had no serious intention of
starting a full-scale battle. Sitting in his car, his face livid, Wu
Sun-fu shouted repeatedly at the chauffeur:

“Drive on! Straight through ’em at full speed!”

The chauffeur was hard put to it. He tried sounding the horn.
This had a slight effect, for it made the girls immediately in
front of the car step back instinctively. The car began to move,
but the girls would not retreat another step. Angry shouts
went up and a hail of stones and clods came flying over from
the back of the crowd, this time hitting the car. Kuan gave a
roar of fury, raised his gun, and aimed into the middle of the
crowd. Just then, someone burst through from behind him. An
arm flashed out and the bodyguard’s arm was knocked up in the
air, At the same moment the gun went off and the shot went
skywards.

It was Tu Wei-yueh. Turning away from the bodyguard, he
bellowed at the chauffeur:

“You idiot! Back out and turn the ear round!”

The car backed in through the gates again, this time without
a warning blare from the horn. Wu Sun-fu sprawled back in
his seat and showed his teeth in a derisive grin. The chauffeur
quickly turned the car round, then drove back along the cinder
path and out through the back gate. Meanwhile, part of the
crowd had poured in through the gateway, but the greater part
of the crowd had been held back outside. Inside and out all
was confusion and turmoil, but the girls had no definite aim
now. The main body of the crowd was soon dispersed by the
police, while the few dozen girls inside were forcibly ejected
by Pockmarked Li and his bullies.

As darkness gradually fell the wind rose again. Everywhere
was quiet again around the factory, but the atmosphere was still
tense and everyone was on edge. Extra sentries had been put
on the main gate. The general office was packed; all the fore-
women were there, including Wang Chin-chen and Ah Chen,
noisily discussing the incident at the gate. The fifty-odd men
brought along by Pockmarked Li were waiting for orders on or
near the veranda. With the day gone, and only one night left,
everyone had given up hope of getting the girls back to work
the next day. Yet when they saw that Tu Wei-yueh was as
confident as ever, and heard his firm, calm voice, their doubts
quickly vanished.

“Right, we've got to get cracking!” he said, addressing the fore-
women. “You've got a night’s work ahead of you yet! Now
get down to the huts and get a grip of the girls! Tell them that
anybody who doesn’t go back tomorrow will be sacked! If none
of them comes back, Mr. Wu will close down the factory! And
if they come kicking up a row at the gate again, the whole lot
of them will be run inside! If they go back tomorrow without
any fuss, we’re prepared to discuss things with them afterwards.
Now, get cracking and put your backs into it! There'll be some-
body down there to make sure you do the job properly!”

None of the forewomen dared to utter a word; they just looked
furtively at each other and pulled long faces.

Tu Wei-yueh now called Pockmarked Li in and gave him his
orders:

“Got all your men here, Li? They’ve got a hard night's work
in front of them, though it’s only for one night. Tell them to

split up into twos and threes and patrol all round the huts. If
they see any girls getting together, tell them to charge straight
in and do what they like with them. If fists are needed, don’t
hesitate to use them! If they find the girls holding a meeting in
any of the huts, tell them to force their way in and round up as
many as they can of them. If they see any girls walking about
outside, they’re to shadow them, whoever they are. Got it?
Right, here’s two hundred dollars. Share it out among your
men.”

Tu Wei-yueh threw a roll of notes on the table in front of
Pockmarked Li, then looked all round and bellowed, ‘Where's
Ah Hsiang? I suppose you’ve brought Chang Ah-hsin along?”

Ah Hsiang squeezed through from behind the forewomen,
looking very down in the mouth. Tu Wei-yueh’s face immediately
darkened.

“I've hunted everywhere but I still can’t find her,” said Ah
Hsiang, reddening. “I can’t think where she can be hiding.
Bitch! I’ll go and have another look for her.”

As he spoke he stole a glance at Pockmarked Li, as if he hoped
that he would put in a good word for him. Tu Wei-yueh turned
away from him with a snort and addressed the room at large:

“Did you all hear that? One of the perishers has already gone
into hiding! — Now, look here, Ah Hsiang! You’ve made a muck-
up of it and let one of the ringleaders escape! There’s no point
in going down to have another look for her. Hang on here a
minute; I’ve got another job for you.”

Tu Wei-yueh stood up as he said this, and waved to the fore-
women and Pockmarked Li to leave the room. Only Ah Hsiang
remained behind, looking very uncomfortable as he waited for
his orders.

It was already quite dark outside, and the cawing of crows
came from the roof of the workshop opposite. Tu Wei-yueh
stared intently at Ah Hsiang, as if to make sure whether this
young man was capable of assuming a heavy responsibility. At
length, he made up his mind and fixed his gimlet eyes on Ah
Hsiang’s.

“When we let Ho Hsiu-mei go, I want you to shadow her. And
make sure you don’t slip up this time!”

Having now disposed his forces, he rang up the local police
station and asked them to send up extra policemen to guard the
factory.

2k

Around nine o’clock that evening, Wu Sun-fu was entertaining
a number of friends and relatives who had come to see how he
was after his unpleasant experience at the factory gate. The
house and garden were ablaze with lights, and the whir of electric
fans was everywhere. It was the same old “bright and happy”
world as ever.

Mrs. Wu and her sister Pei-shan and Mrs. Tu and her sister
Huei-fang were playing mahjong in the dining-room, while Wu
Sun-fu was entertaining his guests (including Colonel Lei, who
had just returned to Shanghai from the front) in the large
drawing-room, and chatting about the wave of strikes which had
been sweeping Shanghai for the past two months. It was an
informal conversation, but their laughter sounded rather forced.
Wu Sun-fu felt as if his mind was being tugged outwards in
half a dozen directions at once, and try as he might, he just
could not concentrate for two moments together. His unruly
state of mind showed in his face, which was now dark, now
flushed, now pale.

Presently, an awkward silence fell over the room, broken only
by the drowsy whir of the electric fan, like some monotonous
lullaby. From the dining-room came the clatter of mahjong-
tiles and the sound of Ah-hsuan’s laughter. After a moment,
two men came into the room, arguing as they went: Tu Hsueh-
shih and his nephew, Tu Hsin-to.

“what do you mean my theory is mere fantasy which won't
work in practice?” Tu Hsueh-shih was protesting. “What about
yours? Have you ever run a factory? All you can do is lie in
bed and dream about doing things!”

He was furious, and his cat-like eyes now stared like those of a
startled hare. Though he was actually three or four years
younger than his nephew, and though he was not, like him, a
"Doctor of God-knows-what” just back from the universities of
France, he was still very fond of playing the venerable uncle
when he was with Tu Hsin-to, and indulging his fondness for
lecturing people. Tu Hsin-to, wearing his usual air of blase

superiority, draped himself nonchalantly against the doorpost
and smiled faintly.

“The trouble with you is that your experience has been rather
limited. My theory isn’t something I’ve dreamed up in bed:
it’s something that’s been tried out and has produced results in
England, or it may have been America, I don’t remember exactly
which — anyway, it was one of the two, And it’s also mentioned
in some elementary book on economics, where it says that this
shoe factory where all the workers have shares in the business
has made great strides and has never had any labour trouble
whatsoever, —If that isn’t practical proof I'd like to know what
is!”

“All right, then: my theory’s also being put into practice,”
retorted Tu Hsueh-shih. “And producing good results, too. Just
look at Italy!” He smiled triumphantly.

“Ah, but itll never work in this country. Go and ask any
factory-owner, and he’ll soon tell you whether it’ll work or not.”

“And I suppose you’re going to tell me that your theory will
work in China? What about you asking a factory-owner your-
self? Wu Sun-fu, for instance!’

Tu Hsueh-shih looked annoyed, but his annoyance was tinged
with satisfaction at having found a qualified arbitrator in Wu
Sun-fu. Without waiting for Tu Hsin-to’s reply or asking his
opinion of his choice of arbitrator, he took a step forward and
called out loudly to Wu Sun-fu:

“Sun-ful If you tried to get all the girls in your factory to
buy shares in the business, so that they could be shareholders
of Yu Hua Silk Filature like yourself, would it work?”

This sudden query startled Wu Sun-fu out of his reverie. He
looked round and frowned. Li Yu-ting, who was sitting opposite
Wu Sun-fu, also looked round in surprise at the grim expression
on Tu Hsueh-shih’s face. However, being a professor of economics
and having heard a snatch or two of their conversation in the
doorway, Li Yu-ting sized up the situation readily. He in-
stinctively raised his hand to scratch his head, as he invariably
did when about to deliver himself of his opinion on anything,
but Tu Hsueh-shih beat him to it, and hastened to explain in a
ponderous but agitated voice. He was evidently taking the
matter very seriously.

“We're discussing how to prevent labour trouble. Hsin-to says
there’ll be no labour trouble if the workers are all shareholders,
and he mentions a shoe factory in England as an example. But
I say his theory won’t work: if a worker’s rich enough to be a
shareholder, he ceases to be a worker, and if a factory has only
shareholders and no workers it’s going to be a queer sort of
factory!”

Tu Hsueh-shih paused for breath, and immediately a gale of
laughter swept the room. Even Tu Hsin-to joined in. The
only exception was Wu Sun-fu, who just parted his lips in a
barely perceptible smile.

The sound of laughter brought Wu Chih-sheng and Fan Po-
wen in from the dining-room, where they had been watching the
game of mahjong. They immediately joined in the merriment as
if they knew what was going on.

“You've got it all wrong, Uncle Hsueh-shih,” declared Tu Hsin-
to quietly amid the laughter. “My theory isn’t as simple as all
that.”

Tu Hsueh-shih immediately scowled and turned angrily on
Tu Hsin-to. “Perhaps you’ll explain your theory yourself, then?”

Tu Hsin-to smiled and shook his head, then pursed his lips and
began quietly whistling a popular French tune. Tu Hsueh-shih
took this attitude of his nephew as a downright insult and
crimsoned violently. Fortunately, Fan Po-wen came to the rescue.

“J think I know what Tu Hsin-to means. He’s suggesting that
in a factory the shareholders should be workers and the workers
shareholders. That is to say, the share capital is contributed and
controlled by the workers themselves instead of being concen-
trated in the hands of a few big shareholders. This may be a
good solution to the problem. The only trouble is that the
women employed in Sun-fu’s factory are so poor that they’ve
nothing left to call their own except their ever-hungry mouths!”

This time even Wu Sun-fu had to laugh. But he still made
no comment. He had never had any time for all this empty
theorizing that these youngsters were so fond of.

Colonel Lei sat with one leg crossed over the other, drawing
on a cigarette and slowly shaking his head. He had been back
in Shanghai for three days now, but his terrible experiences
under fire at the front and his worries and grievances as a prisoner

of war—the result of misjudging enemy positions — were still
fresh in his mind. He had become pessimistic about the war
and about his own career as well. Hence the worried way in
which he was shaking his head.

“There you are then!” resumed Tu Hsueh-shih. “Hsin-to’s
theory just wouldn’t work! Now, I’ve got a better one. I’m dead
against factory-owners closing down, or even cutting down pro-
duction, just because they're suffering some temporary setback.
If Chinese industry is to be developed, our industrialists must
be prepared to suffer certain initial losses. Both sides must do
their level best to help the country: the workers should be for-
bidden to strike, and factory-owners should be forbidden to
suspend operations!”

Having, in his opinion, finally disposed of his nephew’s
argument, Tu Hsueh-shih fully expected that when he brought
out his own theory he would have an attentive audience; but
to his mortification no one paid the least attention to what he
was saying. Tu Hsin-to had joined Fan Po-wen and Wu Chih-
sheng and gone out on to the front steps to discuss something
else. Wu Sun-fu, Li Yu-ting and Colonel Lei chatted for a
moment about the idea of having “worker-shareholders,”’ but the
conversation gradually veered back to the continual ebb and
flow of the front line. A scowl contorted Tu Hsueh-shih’s cat-
like face, and he stalked off in high dudgeon to watch the mahjong
game in the dining-room again.

The discussion of the latest events in the war was now in full
swing, and Wu Sun-fu’s face was flushed with excitement once
more. Although the recent changes in the military situation
along the northern section of the Tientsin-Pukow line had in-
volved the Yi Chung Trust Company in certain losses over their
government bond investments, Wu Sun-fu had great hopes of
an early improvement in the situation, and so he was in fairly
high spirits. He turned to Colonel Lei:

“It looks as if the war’s fast coming to an end, don’t you
think? The bankers had definite confirmation today that Tsinan’s
been evacuated.”

“Hm! I don’t think it’s going to be as easy as all that,”
countered Colonel Lei, the “optimist” again now that his opinion
was wanted. “After Tsinan, there’s still Hsuchow! War’s a

mysterious affair, unpredictable. Sometimes a battered line or
surrounded city can hold out for as long as six months. No, I
think the war’s going to drag on for some time yet!”

Wu Sun-fu smiled faintly to himself. Although he did not
know all the ins and outs of why the colonel had gone to Tientsin
from the front line and then come back to Shanghai, he could
make a very shrewd guess at the reason, so it was only natural
that he should smile to himself at what Colonel Lei was now
saying. The last thing Wu Sun-fu wanted was another long-
drawn-out struggle at Hsuchow after the one at Tsinan— that
would be too great a blow to his speculations! He now turned
to Li Yu-ting, who, to his surprise, suddenly leapt to his feet in
great agitation.

“what! The war drags on for another six months? But,
Colonel Lei, that would be terrible! Just think of the present
situation: there’s Ho Lung in and out of Shasi and Tayeh, Peng
Teh-huai in Liuyang, Fang Chih-min holding Chingtehchen, and
Mao Tse-tung and Chu Teh prodding at Chian. If the war drags
on for another six months, there’s no telling how far these Com-
munists will go! We'll all be done for in no time!”

“you're surely not worrying about those bandits?” exclaimed
the colonel. “They’ll just fold up before a proper army. No, we
don’t take them seriously. Though of course the Japanese
newspapers exaggerate the danger from that direction — but
then they've got an axe to grind. The reason the Japanese are
spreading these rumours is to damage the prestige of the Central
Government.”

Colonel Lei’s “optimism” was getting the better of him now,
and the light of battle gleamed in his eyes. Li Yu-ting shook
his head as if in disbelief, then turned to Wu Sun-fu and gave
him a solemn warning:

“You know, Sun-fu, it's a great pity that you’re having this
trouble in your factory at a time like this! You must settle it
at once— by force, if necessary! This general strike of the silk-
workers is just one part of the Communists’ plan for nation-wide
riots during July, and the present trouble is the starting-signal!
When your girls stoned your car this afternoon, they were actually
rioting! If you don’t crush them first, they may quite easily go

and do something like setting fire to the factory! You couldn't
recover your losses then, even if you killed the lot of them!”

Wu Sun-fu winced as the memory of the afternoon’s frightening
episode at the factory gate came back to him. The hum of the
electric fan reminded him of the angry roar of the crowd. To
make things worse, something else now occurred to prod at his
troubled mind: Kao Sheng suddenly appeared with two men
from the factory — Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan, both
looking rather agitated.

Wu Sun-fu sprang to his feet and asked in a stern voice, though
with a hint of trepidation, “Have you just come from the factory?
How are things down there? No trouble, I hope?”

“Not up to the time we left,” they replied, both speaking at the
same time. “But we've got some important news for you.”

As they spoke, they stared at Wu Sun-fu in a peculiar manner.

Wu Sun-fu felt slightly relieved and did not immediately de-
mand to know what this important news was that had brought
them hurrying over at this time of night. He paced to and fro
for a moment, a forced smile on his lips, then shot Wu Wei-cheng
and Ma Ching-shan a sharp look, as much as to say, “So you're
here to inform against Tu Wei-yueh again, eh?” The two of them
just stood there rather stiffly and said nothing.

When Colonel Lei saw that Wu Sun-fu was going to be busy,
he took his leave. Li Yu-ting strolled out into the garden to
join Tu Hsin-to and Fan Po-wen. Left alone in the room, Wu
Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan exchanged glances and wondered
whether they were to succeed or fail in their task. The clatter
of mahjong-tiles came from the dining-room next door.

“Now, what’s this important business of yours?” demanded
Wu Sun-fu crossly as he came back from seeing the colonel off.
“Tu Wei-yueh in the wrong again, I suppose?”

He indicated with a wave of his hand that they should sit down.

But this time the two young men had not very much to say
against Tu Wei-yueh. They had come to offer Wu Sun-fu a
solution to the strike problem. Actually, they had been sent by
Chien Pao-sheng, the author of the plan.

“Uncle Sun-fu,” began Wu Wei-cheng. “Chien Pao-sheng has
a lot of influence in the trade union. He knows practically
everything there is to know about the girls. For two days now

Tu Wei-yueh’s been hunting around, but he still hasn’t been able
to find out which of the girls are Communists, whereas Chien
Pao-sheng has known all the time. What Chien Pao-sheng sug-
gests is that we should arrest the Communists and at the same
time get rid of a whole batch of trouble-makers among the girls.
His idea is that once we’ve done that the union should be re-
sponsible for bringing in new girls and guaranteeing for their good
conduct. If the management wants to cut wages or stop the
payment of overtime for Sunday work or anything like that, he
thinks the union should be consulted first, so that they can take
the matter up with the women. Chien Pao-sheng says he can
guarantee to prevent any further trouble of this kind even if
you decide to cut wages by forty or fifty per cent.... Uncle
Sun-fu, if you'll only try what Chien Pao-sheng suggests,
you'll find you won't have to spend all your time worrying about
labour trouble, which will be quite a load off your mind. Don’t
you think it’s a wonderful idea? Chien Pao-sheng would have
liked to tell you about it himself long ago, but he was afraid you
wouldn't listen to him, so he put it off till today, when he told
me and Ching-shan about it. He’s the sort of man that if he
says he’ll do a thing, he'll do it!”

“As for getting the girls back to work tomorrow as he says he
will,” added Ma Ching-shan, “why, Tu Wei-yueh will never
manage it! The girls hate him like poison! This afternoon he
went down to their huts to arrest somebody, which only made
things worse! He’s just asking for trouble, doing a thing like
that! The girls all realize that you're losing money, and they
say they're quite willing to discuss the matter of a wage-cut
with you; but they say they’d rather die than go back to work
while this fellow Tu is still in charge! The situation now is
that all the girls in the factory are lined up against one man —
Tu Wei-yueh! They absolutely hate him! And all the forewomen
hate him as well!”

As he spoke, Ma Ching-shan’s shifty eyes darted uneasily from
Wu Sun-fu to Wu Wei-cheng and back again. Wu Wei-cheng
sat there in a respectful attitude, nodding his head and looking
anxious, though listening with half an ear to the clicking of
mahjong-tiles in the next room and silvery laughter of Lin Pei-
shan.

Wu Sun-fu smiled darkly as if to remind them that “to hear 1s
not to believe,” but his eyes betrayed his growing indecision. He
raised his hand to finger his chin and raised his eyebrows as if
he was going to say something, but changed his mind and jerked
his hand up from his chin to his forehead; he wiped it down the
whole length of his face, then let it fall on to the arm of his
chair. Still he said nothing. To all the other worries which
were tugging his mind in different directions there was now
added another worry. He felt he no longer had the energy to
continue the struggle to preserve his mental balance. The
smouldering fires of his resentment blazed into life once more,
and Wu Wei-cheng chose this moment to pour oil on the flames.

“Unele Sun-fu! It’s not that I like running people down, but
I’m just fed up with Tu Wei-yueh and I feel I must tell you about
him. He just relies on bluff and putting on a show with his bright
ideas and his swank! His specialty’s bribery, but he’s just
throwing your money away by the handful! And now he’s prom-
ised the forewomen and supervisors a dollar for every girl they
get to go back to work—don’t you think that’s a cheek?”

Wu Sun-fu’s face suddenly darkened; his confidence in Tu
Wei-yueh was now completely shaken. He crashed his fist down
on the arm of the chair and roared: “Is that true? You’re
not lying to me, are you?”

“As if I'd dare! Ching-shan knows about it, too.”

“Humph! How is it that Mo Kan-cheng hasn’t told me
anything about it? The old scoundrel, he hasn’t said a word to
me about it!”

“Perhaps even Mr. Mo doesn’t know about it yet,” Ma Ching-
shan put in hurriedly. “Tu Wei-yueh’s a real dictator —he keeps
everybody in the dark about what he’s up to.”

He tipped Wu Wei-cheng a furtive wink, though Wu Sun-fu
was so overcome with rage that he did not notice it. He sud-
denly sprang to his feet and bellowed through the door, ‘Kao
Sheng! Ring up Mr. Mo and ask him to come round at
once — no, wait a minute, ring up the factory and get Tu Wei-
yueh to come to the phone. I want to speak to him!”

“But, Uncle, you don’t have to be so hasty about it,” hurriedly
intervened Wu Wei-cheng. “It’s only hearsay, so far. We
haven’t any definite proof yet, and Tu Wei-yueh may deny it.”

He tipped Ma Ching-shan a wink, but the latter was too agitated
to speak and just sat and gaped, wide-eyed.

Wu Sun-fu inclined his head in thought for a moment, then
snorted and returned to his chair. After a moment he flapped
a hand at Kao Sheng, who was waiting just outside the door
for his orders, and said peevishly, “You can go. There’s no need
to ring anybody now.”

“J think it would be best, Uncle, if you were to send for Chien
Pao-sheng tomorrow and ask him about it,” suggested Wu Wei-
cheng, trying to beat a hasty retreat before Wu Sun-fu saw
through them. “If Tu Wei-yueh fails in his attempt to get the
girls back to work tomorrow, there’s no reason why you shouldn't
give Chien Pao-sheng’s plan a trial.” As he spoke, he gave Ma
Ching-shan another sly wink.

For a moment there was silence in the room. Outside in the
garden the trees could be heard rustling in the wind, and from
time to time there came roars of laughter from Li Yu-ting and
the others. From the dining-room came the sound of mahjong-
tiles being shuffled round on the surface of the table and the
shrill voices of the ladies as they commented on the extraordi-
nary luck of the banker in the game they had just finished.

All these noises irritated Wu Sun-fu, but he just could not
shut his ears to them as they hammered away at his mind. His
head was in such a whirl that it was beyond him to make up his
mind. At one moment he felt that Tu Wei-yueh was hard to
handle, too obstinate, too cunning, too confident; at the next he
began to have his doubts about the truth of what he had just
heard, and decided he must believe his eyes rather than his
ears. He shook his head wearily and turned to the two young
men, who were beginning to show signs of nervousness.

“All right, I've heard what you've got to say. You can go
now, but mind you don’t gossip about it to anyone else.”

Having disposed of Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan in the
patronizing tone of a family elder, Wu Sun-fu got up and walked
out. His growing irascibility was now accompanied by a strange,
unaccountable feeling of despair.

He shut himself up in his study and began reviewing in minute
detail all that Tu Wei-yueh had said and done during the past
two davs, and comparing it with the criticisms of Wu Wei-cheng

and Ma Ching-shan; but the more he thought about everything,
the sharper became his conflicting moods of anger and despair.
He was surprised at himself, and at the way his customary
ruthlessness and strength of purpose had deserted him. Even
his never-failing energy seemed to have run out of him. As he
sat there, his jumbled thoughts creeping sluggishly through his
head, he became aware of the sound of the wind in the trees
outside his window: it reminded him of the noise of the crowd
which had hemmed him in at the factory gate that afternoon,
and he felt again the same thrill of fear. As he looked at the
glow of light which lit up the yellow silk shade of the lamp on
his desk, he could imagine the glow from a blazing factory—
his own factory, fired by the girls! No, he just wasn’t his usual
self any more!

Yet still these sick fancies kept hammering at his mind, and
his thoughts drifted from the factory to the Yi Chung Trust
Company — to his loss of eighty thousand dollars in government
bond speculation, to Chao Po-tao’s financial blockade, to the eight
dried-up factories crying out for large sums of money, to the
costly “white elephant” of a silk factory which he had taken
over from Chu Yin-chiu. ... All these problems rose up before
him and whirled in a frantic merry-go-round through his head,
until, no longer able to think clearly, he just sat and groaned
under the pitiless excesses of his imagination.

Suddenly, the door-handle turned with a creak, and Wu Sun-fu
woke from his nightmare with a start to see Wang Ho-fu’s round
face, wearing a worried frown and a wry smile. He rubbed his
eyes and looked again—it really was Wang Ho-fu, and he had
sat down. Without quite realizing what he was doing, Wu Sun-
fu blurted out:

“Why, Ho-fu! Is something wrong at the eight factories?”

“Well, yes, but it’s nothing much— You don’t mean to say
you already know about it, Sun-fu?”

Wu Sun-fu shook his head, still sure that he was dreaming.
He fixed his eyes on Wang Ho-fu’s moustache in a vacant stare.

“It’s nothing very serious at the moment,” said Wang Ho-fu.
“It’s just that everywhere’s being affected by the war and a
depression’s setting in. Every consignment we sent out last week
has simply been returned intact. What are we going to do

from now on? We work our fingers to the bone to raise the
necessary capital, sink it in these eight factories, and then, just
when production is getting under way, there’s no market for the
goods, so we have to put them in the warehouse and pay for
storage. We just can’t carry on indefinitely like this.”

He heaved a sigh and fixed his eyes on Wu Sun-fu.

So it was not that the factories had gone on strike, as Wu
Sun-fu had at first feared. He felt slightly relieved at that,
but in a flash this sense of relief vanished, to be replaced by an
even fiercer feeling of anger and despair. At this moment,
every one of his worries seemed to be tearing at his mind at
once. His spirit was shattered and he found it absolutely im-
possible to bear the strain. His will was gone, and there re-
mained only a sullen fury and despair.

When no reply was forthcoming, Wang Ho-fu frowned slightly
and went on slowly:

“There’s something else. I hear the Central Army has not been
appreciably weakened, even though they’ve lost Tsinan. On top
of that, a really strong defence-line has been built up in front
of every single key point south of Tsinan. It’s going to be a
long-drawn-out tussle—several months, I should say. Some
people even predict that it'll see the year out. Oh, what a mess!
As things are, we’ll have to make a swift, realistic decision about
what we're going to do about these eight factories of ours. If
we don’t. we’re going to go under the way the others have done!”

“The fighting last the year out? Impossible!. . . Though you
can never tell!”

Wu Sun-fu had said something at last, but he might just
as well have said nothing. It was not like him to contradict
himself in the same sentence like that, and Wang Ho-fu was
rather surprised himself. He supposed Wu Sun-fu had been
overdoing it in his own factory the past few days, so that his
mind was now a little blurred. He looked at Wu Sun-fu’s face
and decided he did look out of sorts. He heaved a sigh of
disappointment.

“T can see you're tired, Sun-fu, so I won't disturb you any
longer. We can talk about it tomorrow.”

“No, no, don't go yet! I insist that we thrash the matter out
now!’

“All right, then ... Sun Chi-jen and I have talked it over, and
we suggest that, starting next month, the eight factories should
go on half time—that is, in addition to the wage-cut and the
reduction of staff that we’ve already agreed upon. After a
month like that, we can see how things are going, and decide

what to do.”
“Eh? Go on half time?” exclaimed Wu Sun-fu, springing to

his feet. His dark face was flushed and his expression was
strange and rather frightening. “Why, that’d be asking for
trouble! Workers nowadays are liable to smash up the factory
or set it on fire just as soon as they look at you!”

Wang Ho-fu was taken aback for a moment, but he quickly put
on a smile and said, “Oh, no, no fear of anything like that hap-
pening. You’re forgetting that these are all small factories rang-
ing from a hundred to three hundred workers apiece at the most.
There’s not enough of them to riot. You look really worn out,
Sun-fu. You don’t want to overdo it, you know. Why not take
a few days’ holiday?”

“Oh, it’s nothing, really; I'll be all right. Well, you’d better put
them on half time, then.”

“Except for the silk goods factory, which will have to stay on
full time until we’ve filed our orders for the autumn,” Wang Ho-fu
added. He was quite sure now that there was something wrong
with Wu Sun-fu, and after a few casual words, he took his
departure.

The sky was now a pall of black cloud. Li Yu-ting and the
others had left, and the garden was deserted. The lights among
the thick foliage of the trees had been switched off, and a heavy
gloom had descended on the garden. From the windows of the
dining-room there still came the blaze of lights, the clatter of
mahjong-tiles, and the excited voices of the players, while in the
large drawing-room the wireless was twanging out the last item
of the day’s programme—a popular Shanghai ballad. Having seen
his visitor off, Wu Sun-fu wandered back to the study. Now, bit
by bit, his conversation with Wang Ho-fu began to come back to
him like the memory of a dream, and he realized how agitated
he had been and how feeble he must have appeared.

As this realization came home to him, he was seized once more
by a consuming rage—and not just rage alone, but by hatred of

himself. This hate and anger he now transferred to everything
around him. He paced up and down the study in a frenzy, his
eyes bloodshot and his teeth clenched. All he wanted now was
someone to vent his rage upon. He wanted to destroy something.
All the reverses he had suffered over his own factory and over
the Yi Chung Trust Company now fused into a single savage im-
pulse, the impulse to destroy something!

He lowered himself on to the swivel chair behind his desk and
sat there like some wild beast lying in wait for its prey, his eyes
darting from side to side in search of something whose destruc-
tion would give him the satisfaction he needed and provide an
outlet for his savage desire to destroy!

The maid, Wang Mah, came in with a bowl of bird’s-nest gruel
for him. Wu Sun-fu did not notice her until she placed the bowl
on the desk in front of him, when his burning gaze suddenly fell
upon her hands, white, plump and dimpled. The fierce flames
of his mad desire to destroy suddenly rose to white heat. He
jerked up his head and fixed his bloodshot eyes on her face. To
him Wang Mah was no longer Wang Mah, the maid, but an ob-
ject, an object to be violated, an object whose violation would best
afford him satisfaction!

He sprang up and swooped on her, on this object that he would
violate. Wang Mah seemed taken aback for a fleeting moment,
but then she smiled invitingly as if she understood and stepped
daintily back, watching him with amorous eyes which neverthe-
less betrayed a hint of apprehension and shyness. Before he had
time to realize what she was doing, she moved quickly back into
the corner and stood there leaning against the wall. Then the
plump, dimpled hand moved upwards to the light-switch. The
ceiling-light went out, leaving only the pool of yellow light beneath
the lamp on the desk. Then even this light was extinguished,
and the room was plunged in darkness, except for the faint glow
of a distant light which flecked the net curtains over the window
with leaf-shadows.

When the light came on again, Wu Sun-fu was lying alone on
the sofa, his brows knit in a frown and his eyes staring vacantly.
His strange fury had passed, but his mind was now occupied by
a puzzled feeling of not knowing exactly what he had been do-
ing. He felt as if it had all been a monstrous dream. Gradually,

the same old merry-go-round began again—would the girls go
back tomorrow? How could he dispose of the goods produced
by the eight factories? What should he do about Tu Wei-yueh
and Chien Pao-sheng? All these problems had soon taken pos-
session of his mind again.

He smiled wryly, then closed his eyes and gnawed his lips.

The clock in the study showed the first hour of the new day,
but the dining-room still rang with talk and laughter and the
clatter of mahjong-tiles.
XV

NEXT morning, the sky was hidden by a white mist. While the
night-soil carts still rumbled through the streets, the hooter
sounded in the Yu Hua Silk Filature. Outside the factory gate
stood a line of policemen, armed with rifles and Mausers, to
ensure that the return to work should go off without a hitch.
Pockmarked Li, Wang Chin-chen and all the other supervisors
and forewomen were patrolling up and down around the work-
shop. Their faces were pale after a sleepless night, their eyes
were bloodshot, and they were tense with excitement.

This was the decisive moment of a decisive battle! These well-
tried, highly-honoured “heroes and heroines” were preparing to
“quaff the cup of victory”—though not, of course, without some
qualms about the possible outcome.

On the veranda in front of the office building, Tu Wei-yueh
was pacing up and down like some great general awaiting news
of victory from the front. His air was resolute and confident.
He was well aware that Wu Wei-cheng and Ma Ching-shan had
been to see Wu Sun-fu the night before, but that did not worry
him in the least. He had made all his arrangements down to
the last detail, and he was well satisfied with the results achieved
by the forewomen and supervisors in a hard night’s work. There
was only one little thing that worried him—Ah Hsiang had not
yet reported back to him, the bastard!

The hooter went a second time, this time longer and louder
than the first. After it had stopped, Tu Wei-yueh’s ears still
rang for a few seconds. Now, all the lights in the workshop went
on together, though through the thick mist they showed as blurs
like will-o’-the-wisps.

Just then, Kuei Chang-lin came running up. His little beady
eyes, set slightly askew in his long, square-jawed face, were fixed
steadily on Tu Wei-yuch as he ran.

“Well? How are things going, Chang-lin?”

“The girls are coming back! In twos and threes, and in
dozens, too!”

The two men smiled together. The worst was over! Tu Wei-
yueh turned and ran into the office, picked up the telephone and
gave the operator Wu Sun-fu’s home number. He was anxious
to pass on the news of their first victory. Wu Wei-cheng, Ma
Ching-shan and Tseng Chia-chu were in the room, grimacing and
giving each other significant glances. Just as Tu Wei-yueh even-
tually got through, a sudden sound of shouting came from out-
side. Wu Wei-cheng and the other two immediately rushed out.
Tu Wei-yueh turned his head to look out of the window and smiled
sardonically. He knew what the noise meant—evidently some
of the more recalcitrant girls were trying to picket the gate.
This was no more than he had expected—in fact, he had already
given orders that anyone attempting to picket the factory should
be arrested without more ado. He had nothing to worry about.
When he turned back to the telephone, he found that he had
been cut off. He was just going to ring through again, when
an even louder roar was heard outside. The next moment some-
one burst into the office shouting at the top of her voice: it was
Ah Chen, her hair hanging loose over her face.

“They’re fighting! They’re fighting!’ she shouted, flinging her-
self almost into Tu Wei-yueh’s arms. He dropped the receiver
with a cry of rage, then thrust Ah Chen aside and flew out of
the door. Just as he came out on to the veranda he collided
with Wang Chin-chen, who was also racing up like one possessed,
her face a deathly white.

“Picketing, eh? Run them straight in!” shouted Tu Wei-yueh
as he ran towards the gate. He was pale with rage at Kuei
Chang-lin and Pockmarked Li for being so utterly useless. But
when he reached the cocoon-stores he stopped: a woe-begone
Kuei Chang-lin was running towards him with a bleeding face.
Down at the gate a scuffle was going on, with the police trying
to part the combatants in a half-hearted, face-saving sort of
way. There did not appear to be any girls among them, though

outside the gate several dozen girls were standing in clusters
some distance away, shouting and gesticulating excitedly. Kuei
Chang-lin tried to hold Tu Wei-yueh back.

“Don’t go down there!” he gasped. “Our people are getting
beaten up! Don’t go!”

‘Nonsense! Haven’t any of you got any guts? What’s hap-
pened to Pockmarked Li?”

“"Ie’s down there in the middle of the crowd!”

“The useless idiot! He hasn’t got a clue!”

Swearing angrily, Tu Wei-yueh brushed Kuei Chang-lin aside
and ran on. Kuei Chang-lin turned and ran after him, still
shouting “Don’t go!” Near the gate Tu Wei-yueh found Tseng
Chia-chu standing on a bench with Wu Wei-cheng and Ma
Ching-shan standing in front of him; the three of them looked
highly elated and were shouting encouragement to the tussling
crowd. On one side of the gateway stood Chien Pao-sheng, talk-
ing with someone who looked like a police sergeant. Tu Wei-
yueh took it all in at a glance and began to realize what was
happening. He saw red. Dashing up to Tseng Chia-chu and
the other two, he bellowed furiously:

“What are you lot doing here? Directing the fight? Just you
wait, I'll report this to Mr. Wu!”

The three young men were taken aback for the moment, then
Tseng Chia-chu hurled himself at Tu Wei-yueh with a snarl, but
Kuei Chang-lin quickly tripped him up from behind and he went
sprawling. Tu Wei-yueh now dashed across to the gate, thrust
Chien Pao-sheng unceremoniously aside, and addressed the
police sergeant:

“Pm the manager, name of Tu! Please tell your men to round
up these hooligans who are attacking my people from the
factory!”

“Ah, but we can’t tell which are which!”

“Then round up the whole lot of them!” bawled Tu Wei-yueh.
“We can sort them out later on!”

He turned to look for Chien Pao-sheng, but he had already
made himself scarce. The sergeant now began blowing his
whistle and running towards the crowd. The crowd broke up
and a dozen or so of them took to their heels, while at the
same time three or four policemen came running up to the gate

in answer to the whistle. Tu Wei-yueh caught sight of Ah Hsiang
among those who were running away, and now he understood
everything. He pointed Ah Hsiang out to the policemen. “Stop
that man! We want him! Bring him round to the accounts
office!’

Ah Hsiang gaped dumbstruck at his captors, then tried to ex-
plain, but Tu Wei-yueh was already racing back in through the
gate.

The whole disturbance had lasted only six or seven minutes,
but it seemed like a hundred years to Ah Chen, who was still
hiding in the office, trembling with fear. As Tu Wei-yueh came
back into the room, Ah Chen sprang up, her hair still tousled,
and caught hold of his arm. He gave her a contemptuous
glance, then shook her off and snarled, “You made sure you
didn’t get your precious hide damaged, then! If everybody was
like you, I might as well give up straight away!”

“You didn’t see how flerce those devils were! They—”

“Shut up!” he snapped. “It’s all over now. Go and fetch
Kuei Chang-lin and Pockmarked Li!”

He went quickly across to the telephone and picked up the
receiver, which was still off the hook from last time. He began
calling the operator, but suddenly changed his mind, hung it
up again, and ran out of the office. For one fleeting moment
he had had an idea, but now it had gone clean out of his head.
He stamped his foot with annoyance and began pacing up and
down, fuming with vexation. Just at that moment he saw Mo
Kan-cheng shambling hurriedly towards him, a pair of ancient,
down-at-heel shoes on his feet and a long gown draped round
his shoulders.

“T say, Wei-yueh, what are you holding Ah Hsiang for?” he
demanded abruptly.

Tu Wei-yueh’s face hardened and he gave no answer. His
lips suddenly twisted in a mirthless smile and he roared in Mo
Kan-cheng’s face, “Mr. Mo! Will you please tell them from me
that I, Tu Wei-yueh, am quite willing to talk things over
quietly, but I just won’t stand being pushed around! What the
hell do they think they’re doing setting a gang of hooligans on
us just when we're getting the factory going again! Ah Hsiang’s
an overseer, and if he has a hand in making trouble, of course

he must be punished! In any case, until Mr. Wu comes in, I
alone am responsible for everything that goes on in this factory!”

“Can't the two of you come to some peaceable arrangement,
if only to save an old man’s old face? After all, you’re really
old friends—”

“Not When Mr. Wu comes, I'll hand in my resignation and
clear out of here, bag and baggage. It’s no good asking me
to make peace with those hooligans: I just can’t!— Now, Mr. Mo,
will you watch the phone and make sure that nobody uses it!
If anything happens through your negligence, you'll be held
responsible!”

Tu Wei-yueh’s face was dark now, and his gimlet eyes bored
into Mo Kan-cheng’s. He knew the old man was as soft as wax.
Mo Kan-cheng narrowed his rat-like eyes and was just going
to speak, when Kuei Chang-lin and Pockmarked Li came round
the corner, followed by Wang Chin-chen and Ah Chen. One side
of Pockmarked Li’s face was bruised and swollen.

“And don’t go ringing up Mr. Wu!” said Tu Wei-yueh to Mo
Kan-cheng in a severe voice. “I'll ask him to come round my-
self later on, and then everybody concerned can have it all out
in front of him!”

With this he went across to meet Kuei Chang-lin and the others
to hear what they had to say.

They all went across and stood by the notice-board in front
of the veranda. The morning mist was lifting now, and the
sunlight filtered through and fell on their faces. While Tu Wei-
yueh was listening to Kuei Chang-lin, the idea which had es-
caped him a short while before suddenly struck him again. His
face immediately lit up; he motioned to Kuei Chang-lin to stop
and turned to Ah Chen:

“Go and tell them to give another blast on the hooter, and make
it really long and loud this time!”

“It’s no good blowing the hooter!” Ah Chen protested. “You
don’t think they’re going to come in after all that fighting, do
you?”

Tu Wei-yueh’s face immediately darkened with anger, and Ah
Chen quickly made off. He snorted and glanced round at the
others. Suddenly, his features set firm and he rapped out in a
voice as hard as iron: “You needn't tell me any more: I know

all about it! It was half the fault of some of the girls trying
to picket the gate, and half the fault of that perisher Chien Pao-
sheng throwing a spanner in the works! Those bastards don’t
care a damn about the welfare of the factory! One thing, though:
we've got hold of Ah Hsiang, and once we’ve interrogated him
we'll have definite proof! I’ll give him play tricks on me, the
low-down thing! He’ll go straight down to the police station!
And as for Chien Pao-sheng, we’ll have him up for inciting the
women to strike and preventing them from returning to work
by using violence! I’ve been patient with them long enough, and
I can’t let them get away with it any longer!”

“I think you’re wronging Ah Hsiang: he was only trying to stop
the fight!” said Pockmarked Li anxiously, sticking up for his
friend. Deep down inside, he was longing to put an end to all
this quarrelling with Chien Pao-sheng, though he did not like
to say so openly. Tu Wei-yueh saw his dilemma at a glance and
burst out laughing. Being rather slow in the uptake, Kuei Chang-
lin turned on Pockmarked Li and protested indignantly:

“We're not wronging Ah Hsiang at all! I saw him with my
own eyes: he was telling them to stop and at the same time he
was helping Chien Pao-sheng with his fists!’

“Ah, but it’s always better to lose an enemy than to make
one, Chang-lin! There’s no point in being too hard on them.
The way I see it, we should get Chien Pao-sheng over here and
talk things over properly. If he still refuses to come round, all
right, then he’ll only get rough treatment from Pockmarked Li!
Don't you agree, Mr. Tu? Let’s make a friendly gesture to him
and see how he takes it!”

Just then the factory hooter went again, this time for a good
three minutes, howling away like an injured animal in pain.

“How many of the girls have come back so far?” asked Tu
Wei-yueh, changing the subject with a calm smile—though his
calmness was forced, quite different from his usual manner.

“Before the fight started, I’d counted over forty,” replied Wang
Chin-chen, drawing a muffled sigh and shooting a glance at Kuei
Chang-lin. The latter was staring up at the ceiling, his jaw set
firm and the veins standing out blue on his forehead. Tu Wei-
yueh smiled grimly, feeling that his “régime” really was tottering
this time. For all his manoeuvring and for all his skill in win-

ning over Pockmarked Li, now that the crisis had come the long-
established ties of friendship between Poeckmarked Li and Chien
Pao-sheng had proved stronger than his own influence. He
thought for a moment, and then tried another tack.

“All right, Li; since you say so, Ill let it pass this time! I’m
quite willing to have Chien Pao-sheng over and listen to any-
thing he’s got to say. But it’s imperative that the girls should
call off the strike today! We've just tried the hooter again. I
expect you'll find Chien Pao-sheng in the little tea-house over the
way. Tell him that since we're all good friends we can talk
things over quite amicably—though if he tries any more of his
old tricks, I’ll have to take him in hand to keep order!”

“If you want me to go, Mr. Tu, I'll go, but wouldn’t it be better
if Kuei Chang-lin came with me?”

“No! Id rather you went on your own this time,” said Tu Wei-
yueh quickly, getting in first before Kuei Chang-lin could say
anything. “I’ve got another job for Chang-lin.” He shot Pock-
marked Li a last shrewd glance, then turned to Wang Chin-chen
and told her to take the other forewomen down to keep an eye
on the workshop. He then set off back towards the office, taking
Kuei Chang-lin with him. When he got there he found Mo Kan-
cheng in whispered conversation with Ma Ching-shan and the
other two of the trio. When they saw Tu Wei-yueh, they all fell
silent. Pretending not to notice, he went straight across to the
three young men and said with a smile:

“You three gentlemen have had quite a busy time! I’ve got to
the bottom of the matter and I now know what it was all about.
There’s no harm in a couple of fellows having a little dust-up:
they can shake hands afterwards, and that’s that. Only one little
thing went wrong: the girls were frightened away. But never
mind, they’ll be back any minute now.”

The three of them just gaped at him, speechless. Tu Wei-yueh
smiled calmly at these three enemies of his and walked out. Kuei
Chang-lin was walking to and fro on the veranda waiting. When
he saw Tu Wei-yueh coming out, he looked round to make sure
there was no one within earshot, then shifted closer to him and
asked in an undertone, “You’re not going to surrender to Chien
Pao-sheng like this, are you, Mr. Tu?”

Tu Wei-yueh smiled but did not reply—he just kept walking.
Kuei Chang-lin followed him in silence. After they had gone
some little distance Tu Wei-yueh said quietly and calmly, “Who's
Chien Pao-sheng that you think I’m surrendering to him?”

“But you’ve sent Pockmarked Li to fetch him!”

“Don’t be so dense! We've got to soft-soap him for the time
being, until the girls have all come back to work; once they’re
back we can easily settle his hash! I've got Ah Hsiang locked
up in an empty room round the back, which means that we’ve
still got means of proving that they started the trouble. If Pock-
marked Li won’t toe the line, we’ll just have to find somebody
else, though that’ll probably take us some time!"

“Chien Pao-sheng’s a wily old bird, you know. He'll very likely
see through your little game.”

“Of course he will! But he can’t afford to make Pockmarked
Li lose too much face. We've given Pockmarked Li a chance to
save his face, and if Chien Pao-sheng doesn’t do the same for
him, he’ll come right round on to our side.”

Both men laughed and stopped on the open space in front of
the workshop to wait for Pockmarked Li to come back from his
errand.

By now the fog had lifted completely, and the sky was blue
with a few blobs of white cloud. The two men began to feel
a pleasant warmth as they stood bathed in sunlight. It was about
half past eight now. Tu Wei-yueh had gone to bed very late the
night before, and ever since five o’clock he had been run off his
feet with not a moment’s rest. He was tired, it was true, but
he would not admit it. When he had been standing there wait-
ing for a while, and was beginning to get impatient, he suddenly
remembered something and swung round to his companion.

“There! They’ve worried me into such a state that I nearly
forgot! Chang-lin, I’ve got an important job for you! Go down
to the police station and tell them we want two of the girls
arrested: Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin! You'll have to show
them the way. Damn Ah Hsiang! I told him last night to shad-
ow those two, but you can bet your life he didn’t—he went
straight round to Chien Pao-sheng and his gang and then came
round with them this morning to stab us in the back! And
Chang-lin, if you find anybody else in Ho Hsiu-mei’s hut or in

Chang Ah-hsin’s, arrest the whole bunch and don’t let any of them
get away!”

Tu Wei-yueh waved Kuei Chang-lin away and turned and went
into the workshop. Work had not yet begun properly, and the
filatures were running idly. More than a hundred girls had come
back, but they were sitting silent and sullen beside their ma-
chines. The forewomen were posted all round the workshop like
sentries. Putting on his most agreeable smile Tu Wei-yueh signed
to Ah Chen, who had come up, to have the machines switched
off. Immediately, a dead silence descended on the workshop,
except for the faint gurgling of boiling water in the cauldrons
and pans. Tu Wei-yueh took up a position in the centre of the
workshop where the aisles crossed, with Wang Chin-chen on his
left and Ah Chen on his right. He squared his shoulders and
shot a keen glance all round, then, in the most solemn and sincere
voice he could muster, he launched out into a “pep-talk” to the
hundred-odd girls:

“I wish to say a few words. I’ve been here for over two years
now, and I’ve always got on very well with everybody. It’s more
than a month since Mr. Wu made me general manager, and I
think I can say I’ve never given myself airs. I know you are
all very hard up: I’m no better off myself. If it’s humanly pos-
sible to help you out, I’ll do it like a shot! The trouble is, the
price of silk keeps falling, and every factory-owner is losing
money. All they get is about four hundred taels a bale! Get it?
Four hundred taels of silver! That means about six hundred
dollars! No factory-owner can lay golden eggs, so the only solu-
tion would be to close down the factory. And if the factory’s
closed down, we all go hungry! As you all know, more than
twenty silk factories in Shanghai have already been closed down.
But Mr. Wu has done everything in his power to keep our factory
going: he’s run into debt and he’s mortgaged his house. The only
reason why he hasn't closed down the factory is that he doesn't
want us all to starve! And the only reason why he’s cutting down
wages is that he’s in a very difficult position and has no alterna-
tive. If you'll just think about it for a minute, I think you'll
agree that it’s no joke being a factory-owner! The only way we
can tide over the crisis is for everybody, employer and employees,
to work together and help one another! You girls here have

been very sensible about it and come back to work today. What
you should do when you go home is to tell the other girls that if
they don’t return to work they’re taking the bread out of their
own mouths! It’s costing Mr. Wu a lot to keep the factory open,
and if people don’t appreciate what he’s doing for them, he’s
going to be very upset. If he should close down the factory, you
wouldn’t even get the new reduced rate of pay—not anywhere!
If the trouble is that you can’t get on with me, that can easily
be settled. There’s no need for you to go on strike—I can! As
a matter of fact, I’ve already sent in my resignation once, but
Mr. Wu hasn’t agreed to let me go yet, so for the time being V'll
just have to carry on as I am now. If you’ve got anything to
say, please don’t hesitate to speak up and let me know!”

There was not a sound but the grumbling of the boiling water
in the cauldrons and pans. The girls’ faces, flushed by the hot,
steamy atmosphere, were as expressionless as the faces of statues.
Inwardly, they were boiling with indignation and hatred, but
their feelings did not show on their faces: they stuck in their
throats.

Tu Wei-yueh felt strangely alone and deserted. Although the
temperature in the workshop must have been about ninety de-
grees, he felt an icy shiver running down his spine and gradually
spreading all over his body. He wandered miserably up and
down for a moment, then looked at Wang Chin-chen and
shrugged his shoulders as much as to say, “That’s all—better get
the machines started,” then made his escape.

In front of the veranda of the office building stood Pockmarked
Li and another man, looking all round expectantly. Seeing Tu
Wei-yueh in the distance, coming across with his hands clasped
behind him, Pockmarked Li called to him gleefully: ‘Mr. Tu!
We've been looking for you for a long time! Chien Pao-sheng’s
here with me!”

Tu Wei-yueh stopped at once and looked across at them with
a calm smile, then straightened himself up and walked slowly
over. The lassitude which had followed his harangue in the
workshop suddenly evaporated, and his head immediately began
buzzing with ideas and schemes. He was now dealing with Chien
Pao-sheng, which was quite a different matter from dealing with
the girls. He felt quite at home dealing with a fellow like

Chien. Here at least was someone who could never give him
that cold shiver down the spine!

Chien Pao-sheng greeted him with a faint smile, but said
nothing. It was a smile of triumph. Tu Wei-yueh pretended
not to notice it, though under his mask of urbanity he resented
it bitterly.

The three men walked in silence round to the other side of the
office building, each thinking his own thoughts, except that
Pockmarked Li was making irrelevant remarks and laughing
excitedly. They went into Wu Sun-fu’s office, where they were
not likely to be disturbed, and got down to their discussion. Since
he was the victor, Chien Pao-sheng put all his cards on the table
straight away: he demanded that Hsueh Pao-chu, Chien Chiao-
lin and Chou Erh-chieh be reinstated; that Kuei Chang-lin be
transferred to some other factory; that Tu Wei-yueh should in
future get his consent before taking on or dismissing any em-
ployees; and, finally, that the control and disposal of all “secret
expenses” be entrusted solely to him. In conclusion, he solemnly
announced that he was offering these terms on behalf of the
trade union.

“But Kuei Chang-lin’s also a committee member of the trade
union, isn’t he?” Tu Wei-yueh asked with a sarcastic smile,
making no comment on the demands. The policy he had decided
on was to prolong the negotiations as much as possible to give
himself more time for his own preparations and arrangements.
Chien Pao-sheng’s swarthy face creased angrily.

“Committee member my foot!” he exploded, crashing his fist
on the table. “Well, all right, he is a committee member, but
nobody takes any notice of him! He’s bloody useless! He’s only
one of half a dozen committee members, and anyway he’s just
a windbag! Me, I represent the majority!”

“Don’t fly off the handle, Pao-sheng!” put in Pockmarked Li,
holding down the fist with which Chien Pao-sheng had been
pounding the table. “Let’s be peaceable about it and talk things
over properly!”

Tu Wei-yueh smiled calmly and changed the subject. ‘“Let’s
leave it at that then! It’s up to the union to settle its own
affairs. All we’re concerned with at this moment is the factory.
Mr. Wu has made today the deadline for the end of the strike.

Now we're all in this together, and it’s up to every one of us
to pull together. Before we do anything else, we must talk the
girls round and get the factory going again without delay. Be-
sides, with this general strike of all the silk factories in Shanghai,
it’s a very tricky situation, and one more day’s delay might be
disastrous. I can’t imagine you trade union people wanting to
see us involved in really serious trouble! If there is any really
serious trouble, you would have to take some of the responsibility
for it. So let’s discuss first how we're going to ensure a full-
scale return to work.”

“That’s right!’ said Pockmarked Li to keep the conversation
going, when he saw that Chien Pao-sheng had no reply ready.
“Let’s get the strike over and done with first of all!”

Tu Wei-yueh’s eyes moved swiftly from one side to the other,
and again he quickly changed the subject.

“Pao-sheng,” he said calmly, “I find your terms quite reasonable
and I think we could easily reach agreement on them. That
little performance of yours this morning, though, was a bit hard
to swallow, and you’ve succeeded in putting everybody’s back
up with it. If Mr. Wu got to hear of it, there’d be hell to pay.
I’ve warned them not to let on to him about it, because I think
we can settle it between ourselves. Let’s agree once and for all
that there won't be a repeat performance of this morning’s un-
pleasant business. It doesn’t look at all well when we start
fighting among ourselves, and it wrecks our chances of calling off
the strike!”

“What do you mean! That’s slander!” exclaimed Chien Pao-
sheng. His expression was indignant and he made as if to thump
the table again; but, behind this facade of righteous indignation,
it was obvious that he was a little cowed and alarmed. Seeing
through him immediately, and realizing that his own diplomacy
was winning him the upper hand, Tu Wei-yueh calmly pressed
his advantage.

“How can you say I’m slandering you? Quite a few of our
people were knocked about. Look at Li’s nose! Isn’t that proof
enough?”

“That’s because you got so many people in from outside without
notifying me in advance. When you get so many people together

like that without letting me know what you're doing, a few of
them are bound to get hurt in the confusion.”

“The reason why we got people in was to prevent the girls
picketing—”

“And my chaps were also there to prevent picketing! They
were only there to help out!”

“It’s no use hedging! We've got Ah Hsiang as a witness that
it was your people that started it! While our men were dealing
with the pickets, yours came along and went for them and started
a fight!”

“Ah Hsiang’s talking a lot of rot!” Chien Pao-sheng roared
through clenched teeth; beads of sweat stood out on his forehead.
He paused a moment, then suddenly changed his tone.

“What’s done can’t be undone: why keep harping on it? Now
let me put it to you straight out: do you agree to my terms or
don’t you? Let’s have it straight, with no more beating about
the bush! The union’s waiting for me to give them a definite
answer!”

“But first we must have your word for it that we won't have
a repeat performance of the nonsense we had this morning! It’s
not that I’m afraid of anything myself, but all this fighting among
ourselves makes us look ridiculous outside. Besides, it’s just
playing into the hands of the trouble-makers!”

“All right then, but only if you'll agree not to call in people
from outside any more!”

“We have to call people in to prevent the women picketing
and stirring up trouble! We can't do anything else! Am I right,
Li?”

“Yes, that’s quite right. You’ve got nothing to worry about,
Pao-sheng; all these chaps were called in by me, so there’s no
danger of their going against you!”

“Of course there isn’t! What Li says is clear enough! That’s
settled, then: no more nonsense like we had this morning! All
right, Pao-sheng, you’d better go and tell your men about it
now. Once you’ve sent them away, and Mr. Wu’s here, I’ll tell
him your terms, and then they can be discussed properly.”

By seizing this opportunity to clinch the matter, Tu Wei-yueh
had now managed to put off the discussion of Chien Pao-sheng’s
terms. He was helped out by a word from Pockmarked Li.

“That's right, Pao-sheng, you go and tell your chaps now that
there’s to be no more trouble, so that Mr. Tu can set his mind
at rest.”

“There’s no need to tell them: they won't lift a finger till I give
them the word!” Chien Pao-sheng assured him, tapping his
chest confidently. No sooner were the words out of his mouth
than a sudden uproar was heard in the distance. Tu Wei-yueh
looked alarmed and sprang to his feet. There was a patter of
footsteps outside the window, and Mo Kan-cheng burst into the
room.

“They—they’re at it again!” he stuttered.

Tu Wei-yueh gave Chien Pao-sheng a withering look as much
as to say, “So you’re stirring up trouble again!” Kicking his chair
aside, he dashed out of the room. His face flushed, Pockmarked
Li also sprang up and grabbed Chien Pao-sheng by the arm.

“Pao-sheng!” he protested angrily, his lips flecked with saliva.
“This is a bit too thick! It’s the limit!”

Chien Pao-sheng was speechless with rage. He also graspeo
Pockmarked Li’s arm, and the two of them, still holding on to
each other, hurried out of the room. As they ran, Chien Pao-
sheng at last managed to say something, “Let’s go and see! Let’s
see what’s happening!... The bloody idiots!”

They ran for all they were worth and soon caught up with
Tu Wei-yueh. In the distance they could see a vast crowd out-
side the gate, milling round and roaring their heads off. When
the three of them got to the gate and saw what was going on,
they yelped with alarm and their faces paled: they were con-
fronted by a crowd of girls like so many enraged tigresses! The
three of them immediately wheeled round and started to run, but
it was too late. They were swept off their feet by an angry
flood that swept up to the gate, and swallowed up in the crowd.
Another wave of women came screaming up the street and hurled
itself on the one in front, so that the thin line of defenders in
front of the gate began to give under the pressure. And as these
shock-troops pressed forward, their shrill slogans rent the air:

“Join the general strike! Join the genera) strike!”

“Only blacklegs go back!”

“Shut down your machines and come and join us!”

The thin defence line now fell back, and the girls swept for-
ward like a prairie-fire. They surged in through the narrow
side gate and also burst open the main gate. It all happened
with the speed of lightning and with cataclysmic violence. But
just as suddenly, a crowd of men charged in upon the women
from one side and cut their ranks in two like a pair of shears
cutting through a piece of cloth. It was Kuei Chang-lin arriving
in the nick of time with a squad of policemen. Their whistles
shrilled above the roar of the crowd. There was a volley of
warning shots over the heads of the crowd, then another volley,
this time in real earnest! The defenders inside the gate now
began a counter-attack. There was nothing the women inside
could do now but make a retreat. They surged out through the
gate on to the street again, sweeping aside Kuei Chang-lin and
the policemen as they went.

“After ’em!” roared Kuei Chang-lin. “Don’t let ’em get away!”

Just then, whistles began to shrill from every direction as more
policemen arrived on the scene from the various police stations
in the neighbourhood and began to round up the women. Kuei
Chang-lin and his squad of police made straight for the workers’
slum. They swept through it from end to end, leaving the claw-
marks of terrorism behind each rickety bamboo door. They
caught a couple of dozen girls and drove over two hundred from
the slum to the factory, where they herded them into the
workshop.

Tu Wei-yueh and Chien Pao-sheng had both been injured in
the fray. A couple of stray bullets had hit Chien Pao-sheng in
the leg and deprived him of a chunk of his greasy hide. Yet he
was grateful to Kuei Chang-lin for coming in the nick of time
and saving his life.

In Tu Wei-yueh’s bedroom, an elated Kuei Chang-lin said,
“More than three hundred girls back at work! Just listen to
those machines! And we’ve caught Ho Hsiju-mei and Chang
Ah-hsin, too. We roped in a dozen or so more while we were
at it. It won't hurt them to cool their heels in jail for a few days,
even if some of them are not in the wrong! Those bitches who
rushed the gate—they didn’t give a damn what happened to
them, anyway! Besides, most of them weren't our girls at all:

they came in from other factories!... By the way, Mr. Tu, how
did you get on with Chien Pao-sheng?”

“We’ve come out on top!” said Tu Wei-yueh with a smile of
satisfaction. “Chang-lin, you can go and ring up Mr. Wu and
tell him!”

A thought suddenly struck him: there was still someone whose
whereabouts he wanted to check on, but before he could ask he
felt a sudden twinge of pain where he had been wounded. His
face turned pale and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He
gritted his teeth in silence.

*

So one of the strongest links in the chain of the general strike
of silk filatures was broken! It was around seven o’clock in the
evening, and the gathering darkness brought with it the prospect
of the general strike collapsing. The slum where the factory girls
lived was under close surveillance and was now as silent as
the grave. A glimpse of a girl’s pale face in the gloom or the
sound of a low moan breaking the stillness of the breathless
evening air was enough to alert the watching policemen, and
then shouts and the noise of running feet would shatter the
sepulchral silence for a moment.

From a dark corner of the slum a shadow was creeping silently
out, like a thieving little dog nosing around, trying to find
an unguarded break in the police cordon. Overhead, stars were
twinkling in the deep blue of the sky. A faint breeze stirred and
wafted the frightened crying of a child from somewhere in the
slum. A blast on a police-whistle! ...With slow but purposeful
movements the shadow stole forward until it was finally outside
the police cordon. Now its movements became swifter, and the
twinkling stars watched it dart from one patch of cover to an-
other and finally turn into a squalid alleyway. It gave three
taps on the back door of the end house. The door opened a few
inches, and the shadow slipped inside.

In the front room upstairs were three rickety beds with no
mosquito nets and a single square table. The fifteen-watt light
shone on a girl lying on a bed under the window and another
girl sitting beside her. They were talking in an undertone. The
girl on the chair suddenly jerked her head round and exclaimed:

“Ah, Yueh-ngo!... Nobody with you?”

“Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin have been arrested. Didn't
you know?”

“Yes, but I mean where’s Chu—what’s her name, Chu Kuei-
ying, isn’t it? The one who’s just joined. Why didn’t she come
with you?”

“I just couldn’t get to her. It was as much as I could do to
get here myself. They’ve got people watching all round the huts.”

Chen Yueh-ngo shook her head and spat, then sat down at the
table, poured herself out a cup of tea, and sat there sipping at it.
The girl on the bed patted her companion on the shoulder. “Just
what happened in Hongkew! You know, Ma Chin, I’m afraid
this general strike’s fizzling out again!”

Ma Chin snorted angrily but made no reply. She fixed her
vivid black eyes on Chen Yueh-ngo’s face and saw that she looked
listless, or rather, dazed and frustrated by this latest setback.
Feeling Ma Chin’s eye on her, she put down her cup and asked
anxiously, “What are we going to do about it, then? Hurry up
and tell me, do!”

“Wait until Ke Tso-fu comes, and then we'll have a discussion.
—Tsai Chen, what’s the time? What’s keeping Ke Tso-fu, I
wonder? No sign of Su Lun, either.”

“Twenty past seven,” replied Tsai Chen, rolling over cum-
brously on the bed and sitting up. “I can’t wait much longer.
I’ve got a meeting in Hongkew at half past eight! Oh bother!”
She suddenly threw her arms round Ma Chin and began gently
worrying her neck with her teeth. Ma Chin freed herself im-
patiently and reproved Tsai Chen good-humouredly:

“What d'you think you’re doing? Nymphomaniac!—By the way,
Yueh-ngo, what’s the ‘fighting spirit’ of the girls in your factory
like? All right? Most of the girls here in Chapei are firm
enough. This morning, as soon as they heard that some of the
girls in your factory had gone back to work, they set out at once
of their own accord to break into your factory. So long as the
girls in your factory can remain firm, the general strike can still
go on. It makes things very awkward to have your girls going
back unconditionally just now! If we should fail completely
this time, there wouldn’t be much point in trying again!”

“We're not finished yet by any means!” Tsai Chen put in
quickly. “Now listen, Ma Chin! I suggest we go out tonight

and make a great effort to mobilize as many girls as possible to
break into the factories again tomorrow! Backs to the wall this
time! Even if we fail, it’ll be a glorious failure!... Yes, on
second thoughts, Ma Chin, I think we should go back to what
I suggested in the first place: we should consider no sacrifice
too great, and we should be prepared for a glorious failure!”

So saying, Tsai Chen ran across to Chen Yueh-ngo, threw her
arms round her, and pressed her cheek against hers. Chen Yueh-
ngo blushed furiously and twisted away from her in embarrass-
ment. Tsai Chen went off into peals of hysterical laughter and
threw herself back on the bed, where she tossed up and down
until the bedstead creaked in protest.

“Be quiet, Tsai Chen!” said Ma Chin, gently reproachful.
“Glorious failure, eh? Hm!”

She sat down at the table and began questioning Chen Yueh-
ngo closely about the events in the factory, but they had not
got very far when two men came into the room, one after the
other. The one in front sat himself down with a bump on the
edge of the table; he fished out a pocket-watch, glanced at it,
then began rapping out orders:

“It's half past seven already! Come on, look alive! Ma Chin:
Stop your conversation! Tsai Chen: Get up! You all look half
asleep!”

“you're late yourself, Tso-fu!” protested Tsai Chen, spring-
ing off the bed. “Come on, don’t waste time! Ma Chin! Yueh-
ngo! I'll have to leave here for a meeting in Hongkew at half
past eight!”

She sat down beside Ke Tso-fu. He was young—still in his
twenties—slightly taller than Tsai Chen, and with a thin, pale
face which was remarkable only for the thin, tightly-compressed
lips suggestive of his strength of will. The other young man was
rather on the plump side; his eyes were alert, though edged with
wrinkles of tiredness. He grinned at Ma Chin and sat down
beside her.

The atmosphere in the room at once became tense as they sat
down together beneath the dim light of the fifteen-watt bulb.
Ke Tso-fu spoke first to the other young man:

“Your work’s nowhere near up to scratch, Su Lun! The way
you conducted that meeting of activists from the silk factories

this afternoon was all wrong! You don’t seem able to seize on
the revolutionary spirit of the masses and lead them on from
one struggle to another and to develop the struggle further
and further! Your leadership is tinged with rightism: you're
just marking time and even tailing along behind the masses!
Now that the general strike of the silk factories has reached a
critical stage, the first thing we must do is to overcome this sort
of tailism! Ma Chin, let’s hear your report on the work in
Chapei!”

“Oh, hurry up!” urged Tsai Chen, drumming her pencil on the
table. “Make it as short as you can, because I’m off to the
meeting at half past eight!”

Ma Chin spoke for about five minutes. Her manner was calm,
and she made one main point: as a result of harsher measures
from the employers, they had suffered drastic losses of progres-
sive elements among the workers, so that their footing among
the masses was now weaker. Ke Tso-fu listened to her with an
air of impatience, glancing now and then at his watch; his thin
lips were pressed together tighter than ever.

“I disagree with Ma Chin’s conclusion!” broke in Tsai Chen,
glancing quickly across at Su Lun. “The longer the struggle,
the more new progressive elements will be produced, and the
stronger our footing among the masses will be! Ma Chin’s timid
attitude is a sign of tailism!”

She was now fully determined to push the first suggestion that
she had made that evening. Just because this ordinary-looking
young man Ke Tso-fu always began by accusing people of
rightism or tailism, she felt that he must be right in whatever
he said.

Ke Tso-fu was silent, and his lips were closed tighter than
ever. As usual, he was waiting to the last before drawing his
conclusions and giving his orders.

Su Lun, who had had the glance shot at him by Tsai Chen,
nevertheless supported Ma Chin’s view. He naturally did not
admit his “tailism,” but adopted an easy-going manner.

“while Tsai Chen deals in theories,” he said, “Ma Chin bases
herself on facts. And facts are one thing we shouldn't overlook.
Tso-fu says I made mistakes at the activists’ meeting this after-
noon: all right, I admit that I did make mistakes. But the fact

remains that today’s activists’ meeting was a flop right from the
start! Only half the expected number of delegates turned up,
and the progress reports were unrealistic and largely irrelevant.
—And those who spoke in the discussion that followed were ram-
bling and incoherent. This meeting’s clearly exposed the in-
competence of our junior cadres in leading the masses! If I’ve
been guilty of tailism, our present junior cadres as a whole are
tailists as well! And Tsai Chen and Ma Chin, who are actually
organizing the strikes, are just tailing along behind the junior
cadres!”

“What right have you to say I’m tailing along behind!—”

“Don’t talk nonsense!” snapped Ma Chin. “Let’s get a move
on and decide on a course of action! I expect Chen Yueh-ngo’s
got something to say!”

By saying this she had warded off a dispute between Tsai
Chen and Su Lun and at the same time brought Chen Yueh-ngo
to Ke Tso-fu’s notice. Ke Tso-fu turned his head slightly and
looked expectantly at Chen Yueh-ngo.

“I wish you’d hurry up and tell me what to do,” said Chen
Yueh-ngo. “The other two comrades in my factory have been
arrested, and there’s only me left now! The girls—the girls only
went back today because they were forced to by the police! If
only we can think of a good way, we can get them out on strike
again tomorrow! I’m just waiting for you to tell me what to do!”

Chen Yueh-ngo looked agitated and also very excited. It was
obvious that she was perplexed by all the “technical terms”
used by Ke Tso-fu and Su Lun, and that she had plenty of ideas
but could not find the right words. She only felt that Ma Chin
was right, for hadn’t their position been weakened by the arrest
of Ho Hsiu-mei and Chang Ah-hsin? On the other hand, she
dared not disagree with what Tsai Chen had said, for she had
a vague feeling that Tsai Chen’s words were quotations from rev-
olutionary classics. Now that she had said as much as she
could find words for—though even that had been difficult—she
remained gazing at Ke Tso-fu with anxious eyes.

Ke Tso-fu’s lean, ordinary-looking face suddenly took on a
severe expression. He glanced once more at his watch, then said
firmly:

“Tonight, you all go out and work harder than ever to heighten
the fighting spirit of the masses and ensure that they don’t return
to work tomorrow! This applies especially to the Yu Hua Factory:
the girls there must come out on strike again tomorrow! What-
ever happens, you must overcome all difficulties and have them
out again tomorrow! Give the masses these slogans: ‘Oppose
Capitalists Using Hooligans!’ and ‘Oppose Capitalists Arresting
Workers!”

For a moment there was silence. From the alleyway outside
came the “tock-tock!” of a dumpling-pedlar striking his bamboo
tube. In a neighbouring house a baby was crying. The dim
yellow light of the fifteen-watt bulb flickered overhead. Ma
Chin’s calm voice broke the silence.

“We've almost completely lost our foothold among the girls of
the Yu Hua Factory, and the masses are under close surveillance
by the police. Until we've made some readjustment, we shouldn’t
take chances!”

“What do you mean, ‘readjustment’? At a time like this, when
the fate of the general strike is in the balance, there’s no time
for any leisurely readjustments! The only time we've got left
for readjustments is tonight, and tonight we’ve got to mobilize
new fighting elements so that we can launch a new offensive!”

“But we can never do it in one night!’ contended Ma Chin
firmly, her dark eyes flashing round the circle of faces. “Our
organization among the workers has been completely wrecked,
and the enemy has the workers under strict surveillance—no,
we shouldn't risk it! If we insist on going forward with a new
offensive under the present circumstances, it'll be suppressed im-
mediately, and then what little foothold we still have left will
be completely destroyed!”

Ke Tso-fu sat tight-lipped and silent, adamant as ever. It
began to look as if a deadlock had been reached. Tsai Chen
suddenly made a sound in her throat as if she were going to
speak, but said nothing. Her “second proposal,” which had been
pushed to the back of her mind, was now forcing its way to
the front again and struggling with her “first proposal,” on which
she had set her mind. She was biting her lips, which were
drawn back with tension. Chen Yueh-ngo was waiting, her eyes

wide with worry. Su Lun now intervened in an effort to break
the deadlock.

“Ma Chin, tell us what you think we ought to do!”

“IT don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t make a slight
modification in the alignment of the general strike. In the
factories where it is possible to keep the workers out on strike,
we should fight as hard as we can. That’s only natural. But in
the factories where we have suffered serious losses we shouldn't
run any more risks; we should give the girls a rest to recuperate.
We should then go all out to make a readjustment and get them
properly organized. In other words, we should conserve our
strength until a suitable opportunity presents itself, and then we
can—”

Before Ma Chin had a chance to finish, Ke Tso-fu interrupted
her with a stern reproof. “Your proposal is tantamount to call-
ing off the general strike! It’s beating a cowardly retreat at a
critical stage in the high tide of the revolution! It’s rightism!”

“Yes, Ma Chin,” Tsai Chen quickly chimed in as her “first pro-
posal” got the upper hand again. “You want to break the ranks
of the general strike on the one hand, but on the other you’re
expecting the girls in the other factories to hold out! The two
things don’t tie up!”

Ma Chin’s face flushed crimson, and she went on resolutely,
“What do you mean, ‘don’t tie up’? It'll work out in practice
all right! To take a risk like this would be suicidal!”

“If only we can find a good way,” put in Chen Yueh-ngo with
a glance at Ma Chin, “we can get our factory out on strike again
tomorrow. The only thing is, there are not many of our people
left now, and the masses are afraid of further oppression. If
the same old method is used again, we’ll never get anywhere!
So I think the most important thing is to find a good new
method!”

It had cost Chen Yueh-ngo a great deal of effort to find words
to express what she wanted to say, but neither Ke Tso-fu nor
Tsai Chen paid the slightest attention to her. Su Lun, who
agreed with Ma Chin and also understood what Chen Yueh-ngo
was trying to say, made another attempt to resolve the deadlock.

“What Yueh-ngo says is based on actual facts! By a good new
method she means a change in our tactics—isn’t that so, Yueh-

ngo? Let me make a proposal: since the organization of the girls
in the Yu Hua Factory has been so badly damaged that it requires
a readjustment which will take longer than one night to carry out,
we should allow one more day for this, so that we can bring them
out again the day after tomorrow. This would mean that the
over-all alignment of the general strike would remain intact.”

“No, no!’ protested Tsai Chen vehemently. “If we don’t go
on fighting tomorrow with still greater forces, the general strike
will fizzle out! If the workers at the Yu Hua remain at work
tomorrow, the workers at all the other factories will begin to
waver!”

Unable to contain herself any longer, Ma Chin burst out ac-
rimoniously, “If this general strike can fizzle out as easily as
all that, then it’s obvious that it’s premature!—It’s putschism!
Adventurism!”

At this, Ke Tso-fu scowled. He brought both his hands down
with a thump on the table and snapped Ma Chin’s head off:

“Ma Chin! You're criticizing the Party line! This rightist
deviation of yours is very serious! The Party is determined to do
away with all such rightist views! If the girls at the Yu Hua
Factory don’t come out on strike again tomorrow, it will be a
case of undermining the general strike and disobeying the Party
line! The Party would have to apply strict disciplinary measures!”

“But in actual practice,” countered Ma Chin, “it just amounts
to giving more comrades into the enemy’s hands. What do you
say to that?”

She was still adamant; her face was flushed, but her lips were
bloodless. Ke Tso-fu snarled and pounded the table. “Now I'm
warning you, Ma Chin! The Party has iron disciplinet No
Party member is permitted to disobey orders! You will go at
once with Chen Yueh-ngo and mobilize the women for tomorrow’s
struggle! Whatever the costs, it must be done! That’s an order!”

Ma Chin hung her head in silence. Ke Tso-fu gave her a
withering look and turned to Tsai Chen and Su Lun. “You'll
have to put the pressure on in Hongkew, Tsai Chen! You must
carry out all orders with firmness and purge all rightist views!
Su Lun, I want you now to tell the girls what important resolu-
tions on the general strike were passed by the general strike
committee!”

With this, Ke Tso-fu glanced at his watch once more, then
stood up and took his departure.

For a moment, none of the people left in the little room spoke.
Tsai Chen stretched, then turned and threw herself heavily on
the bed again, making it creak noisily. Su Lun sat gazing up
at the light bulb with a faint smile on his lips. Chen Yueh-ngo
was staring anxiously at Ma Chin. Out in the lane two men
were quarrelling, and a dog was barking.

Ma Chin lifted her head and smiled at Chen Yueh-ngo, then
turned to the recumbent Tsai Chen. “Come on, Tsai Chen!
We've got our orders—‘at all costs it must be done!’ Now, let’s
share out the work between us. Come on, buck up your ideas!
It’s getting late!”

“Oh dear!” exclaimed Tsai Chen, springing off the bed. “I've
got my meeting in Hongkew at half past eight! It’s nearly eight
already!” She rushed across the room, hit Su Lun, who seemed
to be dozing off, on the head in passing, and flung herself on
Ma Chin.

“Oh, Ma Chin!” she gasped in her ear. “There’s a lump in
my heart, as if it’s going to explode, something that’s going to
burst out and burn all our enemies! I’d just like to get my hands
on an enemy and shoot him dead! Feel my face, feel how it’s
burning!... Never mind, though, let’s divide up the work, Ma
Chint”

Ignoring Tsai Chen, Ma Chin turned away and addressed Chen
Yueh-ngo in a stern voice:

“You go back now, Yueh-ngo, and go and see Chu Kuei-ying
and any other close friends that you have and tell them that the
girls in all the other factories in Hongkew and Chapei are deter-
mined not to go back to work, and that if the girls at the Yu
Hua Factory go in to work again tomorrow, the girls from alli
the other factories will come and break in. When all the other
factories are out on strike to back up your factory, it wouldn’t
be playing the game if your girls went back now! If only you
can hold out for a day or two longer, your boss will have to
give in! Now go and do your best to stir up the girls, Yueh-ngo,
and don’t even think about failing! Ill come and see you in
half an hour. It’s now—er—eight o’clock. I’ll make it half past
eight at the latest. You be waiting for me at your place. And

mind you don’t make a hash of it! Afterwards, we'll go to the
general strike representatives’ meeting together.”

“That’s right!” Tsai Chen put in hurriedly. “Both of you be
at the inn at half past nine. There’s no need to get there earlier.
I won’t get there with the representatives from Hongkew until
then, anyway.”

She skipped away from them, gaily humming a tune.

“Right, then! Everything’s settled! Though there are still the
representatives from the other Chapei factories that Ah Ying’s
going to contact; they may get there a few minutes early. Still,
they can wait there. Now, come on, Yueh-ngo, you should be
gone! You too, Tsai Chen, you'd better not hang about any
longer! Remember—half past nine, general strike representatives’
meeting! I'll still be here for a while yet. If Ah Ying doesn’t
turn up in the next quarter of an hour, she won't be here at all.
Still, we can always see her at the meeting.”

“Hang on a minute, Tsai Chen!” Su Lun said hurriedly, fishing
out a piece of paper from his pocket. “Here are the resolutions
of the general strike committee for you to pass on to the repre-
sentatives’ meeting.”

But Tsai Chen was in a great hurry to be off. She snatched
the piece of paper from Su Lun, glanced at it, then tossed it back
to Su Lun. She grabbed Chen Yueh-ngo’s hand and threw over her
shoulder. “I can’t read your spidery scrawl! You'll have to tell
Ma Chin what it’s about! Come on, Yueh-ngo, let’s go! Mm, I
do love you!”

Only Ma Chin and Su Lun were now left in the room. It took
them five minutes to go through the resolutions of the general
strike committee, and then they relapsed into silence. Ma Chin
was pacing slowly up and down, her face wrinkled with concen-
tration. Suddenly she began muttering to herself and slowly
nodding her head.

“Yes, we must certainly take the offensive, but we must def-
initely look after our rear as well. I must think of a way to keep
what little footing we still have in the Yu Hua!”

Su Lun turned and watched her face for a moment, then
grinned and said quietly in an imitation of Ke Tso-fu’s voice,
“I'm warning you, Ma Chin!... Whatever the cost, it must be
done! That’s an order!”

“Oh, shut up, you clown!” she muttered, coming to a halt. “You
needn't be funny about it!” She smiled, but Su Lun suddenly
became serious; he heaved a sharp sigh and said grimly:

“Frankly, I feel the same as you do about all this rushing blindly
ahead and ignoring the risk. Doesn’t seem right. But what can
you do about it? The moment you come out with a different
opinion, you're called a right-wing opportunist, a liquidationist!
And then some little tin god swats you with his ‘orders’! Com-
mandism, that’s what it is!”

Ma Chin glanced at Su Lun with her lively but gentle eyes,
as if she sympathized with him. Su Lun was something of a
“theorist,” and had “the gift of the gab.” She had always looked
up to him in a way, but at this moment she suddenly felt that
he was somehow even more imposing than ever—clear-minded,
able to speak without relying on “formulas,” always smiling that
intelligent smile of his, and always calm and sensible. Apart
from the respect she had always had for him, she now felt her
heart warming to him as well.

“J wonder what’s keeping Ah Ying away,” she said, changing
the subject. “It looks as if she won’t be coming tonight.”

She went across and lay down on the bed under the window.
Her face was still turned towards Su Lun, and her thoughtful,
tender eyes were still on him.

Su Lun followed her across, his eyes never leaving her for a
moment. Suddenly he laughed. “I'm perfectly certain Ah Ying
won’t be coming here tonight: she’s too busy with all the over-
time she’s been putting in lately!”

“What do you mean, ‘overtime’?”

Su Lun sat down on the edge of the bed, his lips parted in a
grin. Ma Chin smiled and asked, “What are you laughing at?”

“Because you don’t understand what I mean by ‘overtime.

Ma Chin jerked round on the bed and gave Su Lun a strange
look, then said quite casually, “Don’t start a rumour!”

“But I’m not! Haven’t you noticed how thin she’s getting just
lately? And haven’t you noticed that Tsai Chen’s losing weight,
too? It’s the same reason in both cases: the demands of sex
and the demands of the revolution both taking their toll at the
same time!”

yo

Ma Chin laughed and shook her head disbelievingly. Su Lun
edged closer and said, “Li Pa’s been looking for you all over the
place again today!”

“The man’s a nuisance!”

“He says he’s going to arrange for you to work at his place and
‘live in on the job.’ He's trying to persuade Tso-fu to transfer
you!”

“Humph! The man’s more of a nuisance than I thought!”

‘Why don’t you love him?”

Ma Chin gave another laugh but did not answer him. After a
moment, Su Lun heaved a sigh and said, “Since Little Wang left
Shanghai she’s deserted me!”

Ma Chin laughed and squirmed round on the bed, then looked
up into Su Lun’s plump face and said teasingly, “I suppose you’ve
been feeling pretty low just lately, then?”

“Well, it’s only natural that I should feel rather put out—”

Ma Chin laughed herself into a fit of coughing. She undid her
top button, still laughing and coughing at the same time.

“I can’t help feeling rather put out about it, Ma Chin, now can
I? I know we shouldn’t take these love affairs too seriously, but
I can’t help feeling rather put out, all the same. It’s the same
with all these comrades we've lost lately: I know they were
martyrs for the cause, yet it always makes me feel rather miser-
able to think about it!”

Su Lun’s head drooped as he spoke; Ma Chin was still laughing.

“tat Ha! You're not a revolutionary, Su Lun: you’ve turned
into a little girl!”

“You know, Ma Chin, sometimes I really do feel like a little
girl! Ma Chin, I need someone to comfort me, someone to en-
courage me. Would you, Ma Chin? I need—”

Su Lun Hfted his head. He grasped Ma Chin’s hand in his and
at the same time pressed his face to hers. Ma Chin did not move,
but gave a suppressed giggle. Su Lun now pressed his lips to
hers and began kissing her in earnest. She swayed slightly, then
giggled again.

“What nice, firm little breasts you have, Ma Chin!”

Ma Chin giggled even more excitedly, then suddenly rolled over,
pushed Su Lun away and sprang off the bed.

“tt’s getting late! I must be off to see Yueh-ngo!—”

Su Lun had stealthily put his arms round her again, and again
she pushed him away. She ran across the room to one of the
other beds and picked up her “working girl’s clothes,” but before
she could put them on, Su Lun suddenly threw himself on
her and grasped her so violently that they both fell on the bed.
Ma Chin laughed and shouted:

“No, no, you barbarian! I’ve got work to do!”

“Work? Yes, the devil’s work! Commandism! Forging blindly
ahead! I can see through it all!”

“What can you see through?”

“T can see well enough that our work is a waste of time! That
the Party line is a suicidal policy, that our Soviet is a tourist
Soviet, that our Red Army is a robber-band brought up to date!
—Now come on, Ma Chin, you needn’t be so feudalistic. .. .”

Ma Chin suddenly snarled and thrust him savagely away, then
sprang to her feet, her eyes blazing with anger, and snapped:

“How dare you say such a thing! You’re giving yourself away
—you're tarred with the same brush as the liquidationists!”

With that she flew downstairs and out of the house to the
alleyway.

Above her head shimmered a star-studded sky. As she walked
along, Ma Chin remembered her dispute with Ke Tso-fu and Su
Lun’s beastly behaviour. She felt angry and resentful, but she
tried to forget these unpleasant things and concentrate her mind
on one thing: her work, her mission. She was now approaching
the workers’ slum. Very cautiously she slipped through the
police cordon and made her way stealthily towards Chen Yueh-
ngo’s hut. A dim figure appeared just ahead of her. She stopped
and slipped aside into the shadows, every sense alert and taut.
The figure moved across to Chen Yueh-ngo’s hut and stopped.
The bamboo door gave a muffled creak. Ma Chin realized what
it meant and went swiftly and softly across to the door. With
a glance over her shoulder, she slipped inside.

Chen Yueh-ngo and Chu Kuei-ying were both there. A tiny
flame burnt in the oil lamp on the table. Stentorian snores came
from the shadows—Chen Yueh-ngo’s elder brother, a stevedore.
Ma Chin asked them in a whisper, “Have you been round to them
all?”

“Yes; fairly good results, too. They said that so long as the
others come and break in they’ll all shut down their machines
and join them.” ,

Ma Chin frowned. She seemed to hear a noise outside the
door. The three girls cocked their heads on one side and listened
intently, but the noise was not repeated. Ma Chin then went
on in an undertone, “Right, then, we’d better be off to the repre-
sentatives’ meeting! Though I'd like to go and have a chat with
some of the girls first. You know which of them are reliable, so
you can take me round!”

“Not a chance!” whispered Chen Yueh-ngo in a scarcely audible
voice. “We're being too closely watched. The moment you move,
they’re down on you like a shot!”

But Ma Chin was adamant and insisted that she should be
taken round. Then Chu Kuei-ying tugged at Chen Yueh-ngo’s
sleeve. “Ill take her round,” she offered. “I’m not being
shadowed.”

“You don’t realize it but you are! Chamber-pot Tu’s a sly
one—too sly to overlook you! I think we'd better let Hsiao-mei
go with Ma Chin.”

As she said this, Chen Yueh-ngo nudged Ma Chin to call her
attention to a little figure in the corner by the bamboo door.
It was Chin Hsiao-mei, and when she heard that they wanted her
to take Ma Chin round, her eyes sparkled with delight. Ma
Chin glanced at her and nodded her consent.

“E{siao-mei won’t do, either,” objected Chu Kuei-ying. ‘“She’s
a little chatterbox, and anyway she’s being watched by the police
as well!”

Ma Chin was getting impatient. “No more arguing! We'll all
go together! Kuei-ying, you go in front; Ill follow on three
or four yards behind you; and Chen Yueh-ngo can follow on the
same distance behind me. Whoever finds herself being shadowed
warns the rest of us!”

There were no more objections, and they set out. Not far away
from Chen Yueh-ngo’s hut there lived a girl who they thought
was “progressive.” Chu Kuei-ying went in first, leaving the
bamboo door ajar. Just as Ma Chin was going to follow her
in, a shout suddenly rang out in the darkness:

“What are you up to?”

Startled, Chen Yueh-ngo turned and ran, but she was caught
and held almost at once. Then a police-whistle shrilled, and
Pockmarked Li and Kuei Chang-lin came on the scene with
their men. They burst into the hut and seized everyone they
could lay hands on. A commotion arose in the slum, but within
about ten minutes all was quiet again. Then a bevy of smiling
forewomen came on the scene and went round the huts reassur-
ing the startled girls:

“There’s nothing to be afraid of! They’re only rounding up
a few Communists! Just come in to work in the morning and
everything will be all right! Mr. Wu will soon make things
right with everybody!”
XVI

It was almost daylight before Chu Kuei-ying’s mother even-
tually began to calm down. She lay on her rickety bamboo cot
after a night of weeping and cursing and frenziedly trailing up
and down the slum in search of her daughter. She had tried
several times to force her way into the factory to see Tu Wei-
yueh and risk her life if necessary. By now the old lady was
so exhausted that she could not stir an inch, yet she could not
get to sleep: she just lay there staring into space with her
bloodshot eyes. Her rage had now passed, and the icy fingers
of fear were clutching at her heart.

The oil lamp on the table had burnt down to the last drop of
oil, and the flame sank lower and lower until it finally died.
Outside the bamboo door, a dull white gleam was gradually
spreading across the sky. It seemed to the old lady that a
ghostly hand was pressing down on her chest and tearing at
her heart. She heard the bamboo door creak and looked round
—her daughter’s head, all bloody, was rolling across the floor
towards her bed! She sprang up at once, but instead of her
daughter’s head she now saw two figures standing before her.
She peered through the gloom and when she saw that it was
her son Little San-tse and their next-door neighbour Chin Ho-
shang, she seemed suddenly relieved.

“Have you found where they’ve locked her up?” she asked
quickly. “Wasn't that her head that rolled in just now?”

“Her head? Of course not! —Some say she’s been sent down
to the police station and some say she’s shut up in the factory—
everybody says something different! Blast ’em!”

Chin Ho-shang ground his teeth. There was a sudden clatter
as Little San-tse kicked a rickety stool out of the way and
grunted savagely. His mother gaped for a moment, then went

off into another fit of weeping and cursing, beating her chest
and stamping her feet.

The slum now began to stir into life, and the factory hooter
sounded its imperious summons. Hurried footsteps began pat-
tering past the door, mingled with shouts, laughter and curses,
as well as the smutty banter of the rowdies as they teased the
passing girls.

Suddenly a tall, thin, rather attractive woman came into the
hut. When he saw that it was Yao Chin-feng, Little San-tse
suddenly rounded his eyes and was just going to swear at her,
but just then another girl came in behind her. It was Lu
Hsiao-pao. She pulled him aside to the doorway and whispered,
“ve found out about Kuei-ying for you. She’s in the factory.
You might be able to get round Mr. Tu to let her go.”

Before Little San-tse could make a reply, he heard Yao Chin-
feng laughing and commenting loudly:

“She only has herself to blame! Mr. Tu had his eye on her
once, but she threw her chance away! Don’t worry, though:
Yll put in a word for her! Mr. Tu’s a good chap at heart!
Though I’m afraid Kuei-ying will have to change her ideas—”

Before Yao Chin-feng could finish what she was saying, Little
San-tse rushed across and grabbed hold of her, his eyes glaring
with rage.

“T'll teach you to come smarming round us, you saucy bitch?’

The next moment the two of them were wrestling together.
Then Chin Ho-shang pulled Little San-tse off, while Lu Hsiao-
pao dragged Yao Chin-feng away. As they went out the old
lady shouted after them.

“It was you two that got her into this mess! You're trying
to crawl round Chamber-pot Tu and be his concubines! You
dirty bitches, you! Makes me feel sick to look at you!”

She slammed the bamboo door to. Suddenly she pulled herself
together and stopped crying as an overpowering feeling of
hatred came over her. She hated Chamber-pot Tu and Yao
Chin-feng; she hated all the girls who were going back to work.
Then out of this burning hatred there grew a vague kind of
pride in her mind: her daughter was not a blackleg!

Chin Ho-shang and Little San-tse seemed to be infused with
similar feelings, though they were discussing something else
now. Chin Ho-shang spoke first.

“It’s getting late! You know we decided yesterday to all
go down together and give that bastard Chou Chung-wei a
shaking-up, well, are you coming?”

“Yes, ‘course I am! If that bloody ‘Red-tipped Match’ is going
to shut down the factory, we'll go and burn him into a ‘black-
tipped match’! We'll smash up his kennel!”

“Ah, but he might have bolted by now! Or he might have
the police outside on guard!”

“Bah!” Little San-tse roared, pounding the flimsy table with
his fist. “Didn’t we all agree yesterday that if he bolts we'll
wait down at his kennel till he comes back?”

Realizing what it was all about, his mother suddenly stamped
her foot and shouted at the top of her voice. “I'm coming along
too! I’m not going to stay here and see you all run in by the
police one after the other! I’m coming with you!”

As she shouted, she seized hold of her son’s arm and clung
desperately to him, though whether she did it because she
wanted to go with him or whether to hold back, she did not
really know. Whatever the reason she clung to him, crying and
shouting. Chin Ho-shang did not know quite what to do, while
Little San-tse, his face flushed, stamped his feet and shouted
at her:

“Don’t be a fool, Mum! We don’t want old women like you
in on this sort of thing! It’s no picnic we're going on!”

With a great effort he shook off his mother and ran out taking
Chin Ho-shang with him.

*

The sun was high in the sky by the time Chin Ho-shang,
Little San-tse and fifty or sixty other workers from the match
factory arrived at the street where their employer Chou Chung-
wei lived. His house lay back from the street at the end of a
narrow lane, the entrance of which was guarded by a police-
man, who would only admit eight delegates out of the sixty of
them, so that the rest had to wait outside in the street, where
they squatted on the pavement and used the corners of their

jackets to wipe their perspiring foreheads and fan themselves
with.

Little San-tse was one of the eight delegates. They found
the front door of the house shut tight, and though they bawled
at the top of their voices for a considerable time, the house might
have been empty for all the answer they got. Little San-tse lost
his temper and began pounding loudly on the door with his fist
and raving at the top of his voice, “You won't get rid of us
by hiding in there! If you don’t show yourself, we'll bloody well
set light to your house and see if that doesn’t fetch you out!”

“We're setting fire to it now!” the other seven delegates
shouted in chorus. “We’re going to burn you out!” One of
them was actually taking a box of matches out of his pocket,
when a sudden roar of laughter came from the balcony above
their heads. They recognized the laugh and quickly looked up
to see Chou Chung-wei himself standing up there, barefoot and
wearing a silk jacket, smiling down at them. The delegates
responded to this provocation by dancing with rage and cursing
and shouting at him, but Chou Chung-wei just smiled. Sud-
denly, he shook his head, stood on tiptoe, and leant his short,
fat body over the balustrade.

“So you’re going to set fire to the place, are you?” he shouted.
“You’re welcome! My belongings are covered by a _ thirty-
thousand-dollar fire policy, and I’d be extremely grateful to you
for helping me to the money! The house doesn’t belong to me
so set fire to it by all means! There’s just one thing though—
my wife’s ill in bed and you'll have to take her out on a stretcher
before you start!”

At this he went off into another fit of laughter and laughed
until he was quite red in the face. The delegates did not know
what to do with him, so they just kept hurling abuse at him.
He took it broad-mindedly—the harder they swore, the louder
he laughed. Suddenly he stopped laughing and addressed them
in a serious voice:

“Now listen to me, dear friends! I’ve got a brilliant idea!—
Go and burn down the factory as well! It’s insured for eighty
thousand dollars and the policy expires in a couple of weeks!
So you'd better hurry up if you’re going to burn it down! The
insurance company’s owned by a foreigner, and we'd all like

to make a packet at the foreigners’ expense! If only you'll help
me get my hands on a nice little windfall like that, I shall never
know how to thank you! Tell you what: Ill stand you all
a slap-up feed at the Good Luck Restaurant! That’s a promise!”

The delegates were ready to burst with rage. They had
cursed themselves hoarse, but still they had made not the
slightest impression on the imperturbable Chou Chung-wei. In
any case, there were only eight of them and even if they did
find some way of dealing with him, there was not much they
could do on their own, so after a brief consultation they retired
to see the others about it.

Chou Chung-wei remained on the balcony to see the delegates
off. When they had disappeared round the corner, he stepped
back into the room, still shaking with laughter. Chou Chung-
wei’s “residence” was the usual type of thing: three storeys of
three rooms each. Since his match factory had folded up, he
had vacated one wing in case he had to sub-let part of the house,
and dismissed one cook and two maids. An atmosphere of
gloom had descended on the house, the more so now that his wife
was in the third stage of consumption, so that she was com-
pletely bed-ridden; yet Chou Chung-wei could still often wear a
smile. He had started out in life without a penny to his name
and had made his way as a compradore. He had never been
really well off, though he had been able to keep up appearances.
He had a genius for “getting rich quick”—and for losing his
money even faster. And however bad his luck, he could always
raise a smile.

Having repulsed the eight delegates, he now hurried back
downstairs to the side-room where he had been playing with
his “models.” Two tables had been placed end to end, and on
them was set out a complete set of toys representing a birthday
party. The fortieth anniversary of his coming into the world
was due in August next year, and he was already rehearsing
in miniature the magnificent birthday party in the old-fashioned
style that he had promised himself. He had started his rehearsal
early in the morning, and was just beginning to enjoy himself
when the eight delegates had arrived and made such an infernal
din outside that he had had to dash up to the balcony and keep
them amused. Now he had come back to his “little display.” It

suddenly struck him that his wife’s death might occur before
his own great event, so he cancelled the birthday party and
began rearranging his toys to represent an old-fashioned funeral
service. He set up a three-inch-high funeral curtain and laid
white satin covers over the miniature ebony chairs, arranging
every detail with greater care and enthusiasm than he would
ever have expended on his match factory.

He had just arranged a pair of lanterns the size of oranges,
and was about to set up the eastern and western archways for
funeral procession, when two visitors burst into the room and
he had to abandon his great project.

The two intruders were Chu Yin-chiu and Chen Chun-yi.
When they caught sight of the paraphernalia on the two tables,
they both burst out laughing. Chou Chung-wei himself rubbed
his hands with glee and joined in their laughter. Chu Yin-chiu
clapped him on the shoulder and said: “Chung-wei, I take my
hat off to you: you’ve got the patience of a saint! And all the
time your employees are asking for you outside—blocking the
entrance to the lane and quarrelling with the policeman!”

“Eh? Are you serious? I haven’t heard a sound myself!
Well, you'll have to excuse me, then. I’d better go and see
what it’s all about!”

He put on a look of great surprise as he said this, and let
the smile fade from his lips. He began buttoning up his jacket,
as if preparing to go out, but Chen Chun-yi grasped him by the
arm and held him back.

“You mustn’t go out there! Let them shout as much as they
like. Remember, Chung-wei: ‘Discretion is the better part of
valour!’ It wouldn’t be wise for you to show yourself just
now!”

“Chun-yi’s right,” said Chu Yin-chiu. “Only two days ago
Wu Sun-fu nearly had his car smashed with him inside it! The
way the workers are getting out of hand just lately is simply
preposterous!—Though you know, Chung-wei, I never expected
to see you losing money in the match business and being driven
to closing down your factory! You ought to be much better
off than we are, when you think that matches are indispensable
in every home—as indispensable as food and fuel. Even the
tramps in the street, who can go for hours without food, still

have to pick up dog-ends for a smoke. And they can’t smoke
them without matches! So even the tramps are bringing you
trade!”

He picked up one of the miniature lanterns and toyed with
{t, an amused smile on his lips.

Chou Chung-wei did not reply, but suddenly roared with
laughter and skipped into the back room like a toad lolloping
along. He rummaged among a pile of old letters on a desk and
presently came back with a duplicated circular clutched be-
tween his pudgy fingers. He handed it to his two visitors.

“If you two gentlemen will cast your eye over this, you'll
see just how prosperous the match business is!”

It was a circular from the All-China Association of Match
Manufacturers to all its members. Attached to it was a copy
of a petition sent to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry by
the Kwangtung branch of the association. The circular itself
read as follows:

Dear Member— We have received a letter from our
Kwangtung branch informing us that, according to reports
appearing in newspapers in Kwangtung Province and Hong-
kong, the Swedish China Match Company, an enterprise
conducted by Swedish merchants in this country, has made
the government a loan in return for a monopoly of the match
business in China for a number of years.

Greatly alarmed by these reports, our Kwangtung branch
has asked us to make investigations and give them a reply
which will dispel the uncertainty which surrounds the whole
affair. They enclosed with their letter a copy of the peti-
tion they are sending to the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry.

We are also in receipt of a letter to the same effect from
our Northeastern Provinces branch, who heard the news
from certain Japanese match manufacturers in China, who
in turn heard it from their Consul-General in Shanghai.
Again, the Northeastern Provinces branch asks us to make
inquiries and confirm or deny the rumour of a Swedish
monopoly.

In view of the currency of these reports, we should like
to point out that we began to investigate the matter as far

back as June, and that repeated inquiries show that the
proposed loan from the Swedish company has not yet ma-
terialized; nevertheless, realizing that, in default of a clear
declaration by the government, the fact that the rumour is
still gaining ground must necessarily cause our members
considerable anxiety, we ourselves have addressed an inquiry
to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, requesting that
they give us a definite reply. As soon as the reply is re-
ceived, we shall transmit it to you without delay.

We enclose for your information a copy of the petition
sent by the Kwangtung branch to the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry and a copy of our own petition to the ministry.

Standing on tiptoe behind Chu Yin-chiu’s seat, Chou Chung-
wei read the letter aloud from beginning to end. After pausing
a moment for breath, he went on to read at the top of his voice
part of the petition from the Kwangtung branch:

... As the civil war drags on from year to year, it brings
slump and depression in its train and has reduced trade and
industry to their lowest ebb. In order to offset its financial
deficits, the government has repeatedly raised the import
duty on the raw materials used by the match industry, in-
creased taxation and issued government bonds, with the
result that business and industry have been saddled with a
crippling burden which has depressed them beyond recovery.

The Swedish Match Trust is taking advantage of this
situation to squeeze out Chinese match manufacturers by
flooding the Chinese market with their own products, which
enjoy a light import duty, and undercutting Chinese manu-
facturers, who are burdened with heavy production-costs.
The result is that our own products are piling up in moun-
tains, and that we are having to sell them at a loss in order
to keep the industry alive.

It is impossible for Chinese manufacturers, with their
limited capital, to compete with the Swedish Match Trust,
whose immense capital and great influence have enabled it
to extend its ruthless dominion to every corner of the globe:
as a result, over fifty per cent of Chinese match factories
have been forced to close down one after the other.
Shaking his head, Chou Chung-wei suddenly burst out laugh-
ing again:

“Well, there you are, gentlemen! You can see for yourselves
what a good business my trade is!—It must be, otherwise the
Swedish Match Trust wouldn’t be so keen to get their hands
on it!”

Chen Chun-yi and Chu Yin-chiu looked at one another and
frowned. To them, Chou Chung-wei’s laughter sounded like
the laughter of despair, but so far as Chou Chung-wei himself
was concerned, it was the real thing. He could always raise
a boisterous laugh: otherwise, how could he be as fat as he was?

Just then, Chou Chung-wei’s rickshaw boy dashed in in a state
of great agitation to report that the workers had chosen ten
delegates, who were now trying to get into the lane. With a
tug at Chen Chun-yi’s sleeve, Chu Yin-chiu rose to go, but
Chou Chung-wei barred the way and would not let him pass.

“Don’t go yet!?? he urged. “I’ve got something important I
want to discuss with you! Surely you're not afraid of these ten
delegates?”

“No, no, it isn’t that, Chung-wei! Since you'll have to have
it out with them, there’s no point in our staying—we'll only be
in the way! If you’ve got something important to discuss, we
can leave it until this afternoon. All right?”

“Afraid not! Look here, old man, I’m very sorry, but since
you’re here, I’m going to ask you to stay a little longer so that
you two can be my bodyguards in this emergency! Don’t worry:
my employees are very civilized people, and I treat them in a
civilized manner! If they should happen to upset you, I'd offer
you my apologies!”

Chou Chung-wei's face was quite flushed now, and as he
spoke he bowed to his visitors with clasped hands. Then he
spread out his arms to keep them in their seats and prevent
them from leaving. The two visitors were mystified by his
antics and wondered what the “Red-tipped Match” was up to
now, but they could not help Jaughing.

But the laughter died on their lips as there suddenly came a
thunderous pounding on the front door, and they began to look
uncomfortable rather than amused. The angry shouts of the
delegates could be heard with painful clarity: “Chou, you old

swine! Come out, you old thief!” The two visitors were be-
ginning to feel embarrassed and their faces crimsoned to the
tips of their ears, but Chou Chung-wei himself was still grin-
ning. He patted himself on the chest and looked straight at his
two friends.

“Didn't I tell you they were civilized people?” he said. “As
civilized as they make ’em! Still, it’?ll take more than rude
names to spoil my appetite! Y’know, Chun-yi, back in the old
compradore days, our foreign boss often got out of bed on the
wrong side and raved and swore at us, and it was a lot worse
than this, I can tell you! In this case, the workers are Chinese,
and we are also Chinese, so that by cursing us they’re as good
as cursing themselves!”

“I can’t help admiring your great self-control, Chung-wei!”
teased Chen Chun-yi, straight-faced. “I bet you wouldn’t turn
a hair even if they slapped you in the face, would you?”

Chu Yin-chiu frowned at this, but Chou Chung-wei at once
shook his head and said in a serious voice:

“Of course not! I remember the boss of a certain foreign
firm—he might have been an American or he might have been
a German, I don’t remember which; anyway, he was a foreigner.
He said to me one day: ‘You Chinese are wonderful. When
somebody knocks you over on to the ground, you just lie there
and say you’re more comfortable than when you were standing.
When you can no jJonger walk on your legs, you just roll along
on the ground!’ Don’t you agree, Chun-yi? There was a man
who understood the Chinese temperament! Yes, we Chinese
certainly know how to enjoy ourselves come what may!”

By now the uproar outside was more furious than ever. Sud-
denly two heads appeared outside the barred window over-
looking the lane and peeped into the room. Chu Yin-chiu was
the first to see them, and he could not suppress a start. The
heads sank out of sight again, and immediately the sound of
shouting and cursing rose in a crescendo, so that the three men
inside could no longer hear their own conversation. Chu Yin-
chiu sighed and turned to Chou Chung-wei.

“You can’t afford to ignore them, Chung-wei! You'd best ring
up the police station and ask them to send some men round to
drive them away!”

“Yes, Chung-wei, I think you ought to do that. Your wife's
seriously ill and it’s not right that she should be disturbed like
this!”

“Oh, that doesn't matter! She’s stone deaf. Now don’t take
me seriously, but her life insurance policy expires on the day
after tomorrow, so if anything does happen to her today, it
would be a case of pennies from heaven for a very deserving
case! Ha! Ha!—Though they’ve been shouting so long now that
they’ve shouted themselves hoarse. I feel really sorry for them
and I think I ought to send them home now. It’d be a help if
you two gentlemen could give me a little moral support while
J speak to them. I’m sure you don’t mind helping me out once
in a while for old times’ sake!”

“Tell us first what you’re up to, Chung-wei,” said Chen Chun-
yi nervously, getting to his feet. “you’re running a great risk
if you’re thinking of pulling their legs!”

Seeing him get up, Chu Yin-chiu followed suit. The shouting
outside suddenly began to die down.

“I can assure you that not a hair of your heads will be touched!
I just ask you to do one thing: whatever I say to them, you
vouch for my sincerity, and I'll be extremely grateful.”

Chou Chung-wei accompanied his cryptic request with a roar
of laughter, then went and opened the front door and shouted
at the delegates:

“Now shut up, all of you! Don’t you know the old proverb?
‘Save your breath to cool your porridge!’ And I’m seeing to it
that you all get your porridge, too!”

The crowd outside had by now increased by one more—an
armed policeman trying to restore order. When they saw Chou
Chung-wei coming out, the ten delegates immediately swarmed
up and surrounded him, everyone shouting at once. Although
Chou Chung-wei was an old stager who had been through the
mill, he now felt suddenly nervous. The blood had rushed to
his cheeks and his forehead was bathed in sweat. He could not
think how to begin. He thought of escape, but that was now
impossible.

“Now stop your noise!” bawled the policeman, forcing his way
through the ring of delegates. “Wait and hear what Mr. Chou’s

got to say before you start opening your mouths! Where’s your
manners?”

Chou Chung-wei raised his hand to wipe his perspiring fore-
head, then swallowed and shouted at the top of his voice:

“Now listen to me! You’re Chinese, and I’m Chinese—Chinese
should help Chinese! Now what is it you want? You want me
to open up the factory again, don't you? Well and good! If the
factory remains closed any longer, you'll starve to death—and
so shall I! So you see, I’d have opened the factory again even if
you hadn’t come here and kicked up a row! Though you ought
to thank your lucky stars that I’ve just had two Gods of Wealth
come to see me—look, there they are in my room! They’ve
promised me a loan, so tomorrow we all go back to work again!”

Chou Chung-wei broke into an exultant laugh, but by now
he was out of breath and so excited that his laughter quickly
petered out and left him standing there open-mouthed and pant-
ing for breath, his eyes wide and staring. Some of the delegates
began to look threateningly at him again—though they made no
sound—while others ran through the front door to see if there
really were any Gods of Wealth there. Chou Chung-wei quickly
ran in after them, and shouted into the side-room in spite of
his panting:

“Mr. Chen the banker and Mr. Chu the director! Would you
be so good as to step this way and meet my employees’ repre-
sentatives?”

Chu Yin-chiu did his best to keep a straight face as he walked
slowly into the drawing-room, and stood looking out at the dele-
gates, a frown on his face. Behind him came Chen Chun-yi,
though he was still smiling.

The delegates suddenly fell silent, then began to look inquir-
ingly at one another as if unable to decide whether or not these
two “Gods of Wealth” were the genuine article.

“There you are, then!” bawled the policeman. “Mr. Chou’s
promised to open the factory again, so there’s nothing for you
to wait about here for! Now come on, it’s against the regula-
tions to kick up a row like this! Any more trouble, and you’l
go straight down to the station!”

He began to move them on, but Chou Chung-wei stopped him
and addressed the delegates again, this time smiling and shaking
his clasped hands respectfully up and down.

“I should like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart!
If you hadn't made such a noise just now, my two friends, the
banker and the director here, wouldn’t have lent me the money!
All’s well that ends well, and tomorrow we'll be back at work.
And when I say a thing I mean it!”

“And don't think you can run away, either!” shouted Little
San-tse as he moved off behind the other delegates, then spat
in the direction of the front door.

As the three proprietors came back into the room, they all
burst out laughing at once. Chou Chung-wei began walking up
and down, his fleshy head wagging with elation, as if he had
actually obtained a loan. He had always kept at the back of
his mind two ways of getting financial assistance, and in his
present mood of elation they suddenly came back to him and he
began toying with them in a make-believe sort of way: he
glanced at Chu Yin-chiu and thought to himself: “Let’s pretend
he’s the head of that Japanese!” The idea so amused him that
he could not help laughing again. He was still laughing when
Chen Chun-yi suddenly said in a solemn voice:

“Chung-wei, you really must think of a way out. You got rid
of them today by pulling their legs, but you’re going to find your-
self in a bit of a mess when they come back tomorrow and start
kicking up a row again!”

“Chun-yi’s right,” put in Chu Yin-chiu. “When they come
back tomorrow, you'll find they won’t be so civilized as they
were just now. You'll have to forestall them!”

He frowned, and Chou Chung-wei thought how much more he
resembled the head of the Japanese firm when he frowned. The
thought made him smile as he replied:

“A way out? Ah, but I’ve got one! And you are the people
who can help me out!”

The two visitors were taken aback for a moment, especially
as Chou Chung-wei did not look as if he was joking. Putting
on his gravest expression, he went on:

‘Tye got it all worked out. I’m fed up with my business and
whoever wants what's left of my factory can have it. It’s a pity

the Swedish Match Trust isn’t going to run factories in this
country, otherwise I might co-operate with them. Now a short
while ago I told you I’d got something important that I wanted
to consult you about: well, here it is. So far as I can see, there
are two ways open to me: either I go to see the head of a Jap-
anese firm I know quite well and who’s willing to help me out,
or else I approach the Yi Chung Trust Company. Being a
Chinese, I naturally prefer to give one of my own kind the first
chance. Besides, Wang Ho-fu, Sun Chi-jen and Wu Sun-fu are
old friends of mine and it’s only natural that I should approach
someone I know very well first. Well, that’s the way I look
at it, though of course, I don’t know what their reaction would
be. Now the thing is, both of you have very close dealings
with the Yi Chung Company, so I was hoping you’d be able
to tell me whether they’d help me out or not.”

“I see... you’re thinking of trying that way, eh?” said Chen
Chun-yi hesitantly, with a glance at Chu Yin-chiu. “Are you
thinking of leasing your factory or selling out? They don’t
make loans on pledges, you know!”

Chou Chung-wei’s reference to the Yi Chung Trust Company
had touched one of Chu Yin-chiu’s tender spots, and, being sus-
picious by nature, he assumed that Chou Chung-wei was pur-
posely taunting him. He frowned and sighed, but said nothing.

“Doesn’t matter which! Either way will do!” replied Chou
Chung-wei quickly. “In any case, we’re all friends, so we can
easily come to an agreement on that!”

One would have assumed from his eagerness that Chen Chun-
yi was a representative from the Yi Chung Company and that
their informal exchanges were serious negotiations for a con-
tract! Chen Chun-yi smiled. Although he felt that Chou
Chung-wei was being rather too precipitate, he fully sympathized
with him, and his voice was earnest as he went on:

“As you probably know, Chung-wei, Wu Sun-fu is the real
power behind the Yi Chung Trust Company. He’s very sharp,
is Sun-fu, and fastidious, too! Offer him something, and he’ll
pick holes in it; but let him once take a fancy to your factory,
and it’s a different story altogether: he’ll badger you and harry
you until you’re in an impossible position, and you’ll end up by

going and begging him to take it! Our friend Yin-chiu here,
for instance, had suffered at his hands in exactly that way—”

“Your best bet’s your Japanese friend!” interrupted Chu Yin-
chiu, and heaved a sigh of resentment. “You might as well try
to take a piece of meat out of a tiger’s mouth as have dealings
with Wu Sun-ful”

So it was good-bye to Chou Chung-wei’s castles in the air.
His face was flushed and his eyes were wide and staring. As
a matter of fact, he had already made overtures to his Japanese
friend, but the latter’s terms had been so harsh that he had been
driven to consider trying the Yi Chung Trust Company. Now
that he had heard what his two friends had to say about Wu
Sun-fu, he was beginning to feel desperate. For the first time
in his life, he could not even raise a laugh! Nevertheless, he
had not yet entirely given up hope, for he did not mind being
badly treated, so long as the ill-treatment was accompanied
by a cash profit, however small. He wiped his hand across his
perspiring forehead, then, a lugubrious expression on his face,
he asked in an agitated voice:

“Now tell me, Chun-yi, how does one go about leasing out a
factory? I suppose both of you leased yours?”

“Yes, both of us. Yin-chiu’s turned over his factory to Wu
Sun-fu, lock, stock and barrel. He doesn’t have anything to
do with it now, except to collect the rent for it—five hundred
taels of silver a month. As for me, I’m in charge of my fac-
tory the same as before, with the empty title of general man-
ager, and they pay me a monthly salary. People outside think
I'm still the proprietor, but as a matter of fact I can’t do a
thing without asking Wang Ho-fu first—still, I can’t grumble:
Wang Ho-fu’s a decent chap and we get on well enough to-
gether! Instead of me collecting rent for the factory buildings
and machinery, we have a special arrangement whereby I get
one per cent of the price of every piece of goods produced as
compensation for the depreciation of the buildings and machinery.
Well, that’s the way they work. You see how sharp they are!”

“Well, I’m perfectly agreeable to an arrangement such as
yours! Perfectly agreeable!” exclaimed Chou Chung-wei, leap-
ing to his feet. His hopes had revived and he could smile once

again. But Chu Yin-chiu threw cold water on his rising spirits
when he said gloomily:

“Tm afraid you’re going to change your tune when you hear
what sort of a monthly salary Chun-yi gets! Two hundred and
fifty dollars! A mere two hundred and fifty dollars for managing
a silk goods factory employing over three hundred workers! Wu
Sun-fu has the cheek to offer it, and Chun-yi has the goodness
to take it. I wouldn’t!”

“I’ve got no choice in the matter! It’s better than closing
down the factory and letting the machinery go rusty! My
machinery is good, and I couldn’t bear to see it go rusty. That’s
where the shoe pinches: they’ve got the better of me whatever
I do! Still, so long as I can still have the run of my factory
and keep an eye on things, I don’t mind so much. Don’t you
agree, Chung-wei?”

Chou Chung-wei nodded but did not speak. An unusually
grim expression clouded his plump face: he was thinking hard.
He was rather taken by the idea of leasing out his factory under
the same arrangement as Chen Chun-yi. It appealed to him
mainly because by staying on as manager he would still be the
proprietor so far as people outside were concerned. For Chou
Chung-wei, this was not merely a matter of vanity, but also
something which meant a lot to him financially: for years now
he struggled to keep up appearances, and this he had managed
to do almost entirely on the strength of his impressive but
worthless title of “proprietor of a match factory.” If ever he
should lose this title, he would be unmasked and hard put to
it to deal with the swarm of creditors who would descend
upon him. And that would be an end to his easy laughter.

So Chou Chung-wei decided to try his luck with Wu Sun-fu.
His ambition now was to become “Chen Chun-yi the Second.”

He suddenly sprang to his feet, clapped his hands together,
and turned to Chen Chun-yi:

“You're perfectly right when you say that one shouldn’t let
one’s machinery lie idle and go rusty! And as you saw, that
petition from the Kwangtung branch association stated quite
clearly that over fifty per cent of the Chinese match factories
have closed down! Being a Chinese, I’m under an obligation
to protect Chinese factories! My Japanese friend has offered

me a high price for my factory, and although he’s a Japanese,
China and Japan have always been friendly neighbours and
have the same linguistic and racial origins, so it’s not the same
thing as selling out to a complete foreigner like a Swedish match
king; nevertheless, for all that, I won’t let him have it! I'd
much rather let the Yi Chung Company have the benefit of my
factory. It’s up to us Chinese to help one another! That’s that,
then! I’m off to see Wu Sun-fu about it this very minute!”

“you're wasting your time, Chung-wei!” said Chu Yin-chiu
gloomily, dousing Chou Chung-wei’s hopes once more. "“T don’t
need a crystal ball to tell you that you won't cut any ice with
Wu Sun-fu, and that you'll come away with a flea in your ear!”

Chou Chung-wei sprang up in alarm, his face flushed. Chen
Chun-yi quickly intervened:

“There’s no harm in trying, Chung-wei. Not so long ago the
Yi Chung Company bought out eight factories all at once, so
it would seem that your proposition is in their line of business.
Though I shouldn’t advise you to see Wu Sun-fu, you’d much
better approach Wang Ho-fu. He’s easier to deal with, and any-
way, he’s the company’s general manager.”

Chou Chung-wei looked slightly relieved and nodded his head.
He was so eager to become “Chen Chun-yi the Second” that
everything Chen Chun-yi said was music in his ears. It gave
him the creeps to listen to that bird of ill omen, the pessimistic
Chu Yin-chiu. He cast a sidelong glance at Chu Yin-chiu, and
had to laugh despite himself. He was thinking: “The more I
look at you, the more you look like that Japanese fellow! A
bad lot, that Jap!”

*

At one o’clock that afternuon, Chou Chung-wei was sitting in
the manager's office of the Yi Chung Trust Company, talking
with Wang Ho-fu and cherishing great hopes. At a desk under
the window sat a young typist tapping steadily away at a Chinese
typewriter. Wang Ho-fu sat there with a worried expression on
his face, listening absently to what Chou Chung-wei was saying
and glancing every now and then at the typist, as if he was not
satisfied with his speed. Suddenly, the muffled jangle of a tele-
phone came from the private office next door, and a clerk came
into the room and drew Wang Ho-fu’s attention to it:

“Phone for you, sir.”

“Exeuse me, Mr. Chou. I won’t be a moment.”

So saying, Wang Ho-fu hurried off, despite the fact that Chou
Chung-wei was just coming to the crucial point, and the door of
the private office slammed shut behind him.

Chou Chung-wei drew a deep breath, mopped his perspiring
brow, and gulped down a mouthful of tea. The room seemed like
an oven to him. His corpulent frame was bathed in sweat and
he was finding it difficult to breathe. The breeze from the elec-
tric fan seemed hot and stifling and only served to add to his
discomfort. He stood up and walked up and down for a mo-
ment, then stopped behind the typist and glanced casually at
what he was typing. He was half-way through a notice, and
Chou Chung-wei would have given it no more than a passing
glance if one particular sentence had not leapt up at him and
held his attention. As he stared at it, his hopes gradually began
to ebb away until they had almost vanished. This is what had
caught his eye: “In order to cut down production, the eight
factories will operate on half time for the time being.”

When Chou Chung-wei sat down again, he was _ perspiring
more profusely than ever, yet the icy fingers of despair were
closing round his ever-cheerful heart and sapping his vitality.
He sat there mechanically wiping his forehead with his hand
and staring anxiously at the door of the private office, wishing
that Wang Ho-fu would hurry up and come out again.

Five minutes passed, then ten, but still there was no sign
of Wang Ho-fu. Although Chou Chung-wei was normally quite
patient, he was beginning to feel he had been left to cool his
heels too long. Meanwhile, the typist had finished what he was
doing, stretched, and was now leaning out of the window and
watching the fashionably-dressed girls and round-bellied busi-
nessmen in the street below.

Unable to wait any longer—especially in this stifling heat—
Chou Chung-wei decided to go and fetch Wang Ho-fu back, but
he was in such a flurry that he went the wrong way—over to
the door leading to the corridur. He did not realize his mistake
until he had his hand on the door. He laughed at his mistake;
the door at once swung open as if he had laughed it open, and
a gust of perfume struck him. He found himself face to face

with a man and a woman, both acquaintances of his, who stood
there smiling at him. The woman was Hsu Man-li and the
man was Colonel Lei, and they were arm in arm,

“Well! If it isn’t Colonel Lei!” Chou Chung-wei exclaimed,
beaming at him. “How long have you been back? This is a
pleasant surprise!”

His low spirits had suddenly vanished. Before the colonel
could reply, he turned quickly to Hsu Man-li and greeted her
as warmly. His numbed mind had revived again—he had a
brain-wave. Here under his very nose was the opportunity he
had been looking for. From Hsu Man-li his thoughts had flashed
to Chao Po-tao, from Chao Po-tao to the news of Chao Po-tao’s
latest success in stock-jobbing, and then, what was most im-
portant, from Chao Po-tao’s success to the widely-circulated
rumour that Chao Po-tao was organizing some kind of trust to
buy up factories! His smouldering hopes had burst into flame
once more, and he began reproaching himself for being so stupid
as not to have thought of the idea before, for Chao Po-tao was
a real “God of Wealth” if anyone was!

Wang Ho-fu now emerged from his private office, and after
the usual exchange of courtesies he drew Colonel Lei to one side
and they had a whispered conversation together. His mind now
buzzing with ideas, Chou Chung-wei seized on this opportunity
to ingratiate himself with Hsu Man-li and soon the room was
ringing with his boisterous laughter. Hsu Man-li pursed her
lips in a smile and cooed:

“It's very nice of you, Mr. Chou, to play the host and entertain
me like this! No wonder they call you the ‘Red-tipped Match’!”

At this he laughed louder than ever. Suddenly, he stopped
and the smile vanished from his face.

“Miss Hsu,” he said in a serious voice. “I wonder if you’d
do me a little favour? It’s nothing much, but you're the only
person who can help me!”

“Er—what is it, then?”

“It’s—it’s just a trifle, really. You see, as a result of the war,
my factory’s been running into difficulties—”

“Ah, yes, I know! Everyone who owns a factory feels the
pinch in wartime. But you have nothing to worry about, Mr.

Chou! you’re the famous ‘Red-tipped Match’ and you strike up
friendships wherever you go!”

“Ah, but this is an unusually black year for me. Very unusual.
All the ready money which should be in circulation is locked
up in stocks and bonds, and if you ask anybody for a loan of
a few thousand dollars, he just shakes his head. Fact is, I’m
in a bit of a jam at the moment. I don’t need much—matter of
fifty thousand dollars; though even twenty or thirty thousand
would probably tide me over. I’m sure you'll help me out, Miss
Hsu?”

“What! Me help you? You're pulling my leg!”

“Not at all! I’m quite serious about it! I know Chao Po-tao
gives loans right and left, but I haven’t lived up to my name
‘Red-tipped Match’ by striking up acquaintance with that God
of Wealth. I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this stroke
of good luck, running into you like this today, Miss Hsu—I must
have had very virtuous ancestors! What I want you to do is
to be so good as to put a word in for me. One word from you
would be better than an imperial edict; one nod from Chao Po-
tao and I'm saved!”

Before Chou Chung-wei had finished what he was saying, Hsu
Man-li’s pretty face suddenly clouded over. She shot him one
indignant glance as much as to say, “Stop trying to take the rise
out of me!” then turned her head away and shook her shoulders
peevishly. Realizing that something had gone wrong, Chou
Chung-wei suddenly felt at a loss. He licked his lips and dared
not say anything more, After a while, Hsu Man-li looked round
again and said with a wry smile:

“Ym having nothing more to do with Chao Po-tao, the scoun-
drel! If you want an introduction to him, you'll have to get
somebody else to do it for you!”

Chou Chung-wei’s heart sank completely at this. One more
ray of hope had been quenched. His mind was numb. Hsu
Man-li now rose lightly to her feet with a sway of her hips and
threw Chou Chung-wei a glance which held a hint of mockery.
He sprang up in great agitation to make a final appeal, but Hsu
Man-li had already turned and glided away. Wang Ho-fu now
came across and patted Chou Chung-wei on the shoulder.

‘we didn’t finish our conversation just now, Chung-wei, but
I think I know well enough what it was you came about. When
we first set up this company—you remember how we first
discussed the idea at Old Mr. Wu’s funeral—we originally in-
tended to make it the foundation for an industrial bank to finance
our colleagues in industry. Unfortunately, conditions have
changed since then, and as a result we’ve been able to manage
very little in the way of industrial loans, and we're unable to
meet all requests we get from our friends. We've taken over
eight factories, it's true, but the war has dulled our markets
along the Yangtse, and we’ve run up against keen competition
from the local Japanese factories, so that we’re now reduced
te cutting down production putting the factories on half time.
There’s nothing we’d like better than to help you, but we just
can’t manage it. Sorry to have to disappoint you.”

“Yes, Chinese industry’s been going to the dogs for the past
six months!” put in Colonel Lei, who had just walked across
to join them. “The flour mills in Tientsin have always done
a roaring trade and been the pride of the Chinese flour industry;
but look at them now: seven of the eight big mills are closed
down, and the remaining one only works one day in three!”

Chou Chung-wei was bathed in sweat, and found it hard
to speak, even. When he finally managed to get a few words
out, it was in a voice which he hardly recognized as his own.
All he could do was to repeat over and over again that his re-
quirements were very modest, that his products were selling
steadily, and that his business had not suffered as a result of
the war.

“We all run factories, Chung-wei, so we all know what the
position is, and we can well appreciate each other’s difficulties.
The fact of the matter is that in this company we launched out
on a large scale without the necessary capital behind us. As a
result, we just haven’t got the money to make any more loans.”

“Even so, Mr. Wang, surely you can at least take over my
factory on lease, the same as you did with Chen Chun-yi’s
factory?”

“If you’d come to us with this proposition a month ago,
Chung-wei, we could have accommodated you. As it is, I’m
afraid you'll have to forgive us.”

As he made this flat refusal, Wang Ho-fu looked into Chou
Chung-wei’s perspiring face with a grim smile.

Now that all his hopes were dashed to the ground, Chou Chung-
wei suddenly burst out laughing. He pointed at Colonel Lei with
one hand and at Wang Ho-fu with the other, and shouted
hysterically:

“I say! Do you remember? The day of Old Mr. Wu’s funeral!
Miss Hsu Man-li was there, too! Remember how she danced
on the billiard-table? And lost one of her shoes? Ha _ ha!
Wonderful time we had—seems like a dream now!—But you
mustn’t apologize for not being able to help me, Ho-fu-—-we’re old
friends and we don’t have to be so formal about it! But let
me tell you something: every Chinese factory will sooner or
later be as dead as a door-nail, unless they get a transfusion of
foreign blood! Don’t you agree, Colonel Lei? Just you wait
and see! Ha ha! Come on, Miss Hsu, give us another dance!
This table here’s nice and smooth! Let’s enjoy ourselves while
we can!”

Colonel Lei and Miss Hsu both laughed, but Wang Ho-fu
frowned and his face darkened as he remembered all that had
happened since the day of Old Mr. Wu's funeral: Yes, “dream”
was the right word. They had dreamed of giving industry a
new lease of life, but now—now it looked as if they would soon
be brought back to earth with a jolt!

“It’s getting late,’ Hsu Man-li reminded Colonel Lei and
Wang Ho-fu with a slight frown. “We’ll have to hurry up if
we're going to keep our appointment with Sun-fu at two
o’clock!”

She gave Chou Chung-wei what could have been a significant
glance, but he seemed to be quite unaware that the three of
them had some private business of their own to attend to.
Nevertheless the words “two o’clock” seemed to have a magical
effect on him, for he suddenly leapt to his feet with a “Cheerio!”
and raced out. As he went down the stairs he laughed to him-
self and before he was out of the building he had made up his
mind to go straight round to his Japanese friend and ask him
for “a transfusion of Japanese blood.” Now he was his cheer-
ful self once again. As he sat in his private rickshaw, he rea-
soned with himself in this fashion: China and Japan are old

friends with common linguistic and racial origins, which means
that a Japanese must be better than a beaky-nosed European.
When you try to be patriotic and they won't let you, what else
is there you can do? In any case, he wouldn’t be the first by
any means to throw in his lot with the foreigners!

A motorcar roared up behind him and flashed past.

He caught a glimpse of the people in the car—Hsu Man-li
and Wang Ho-fu. With Colonel Lei between them. They struck
him as an incongruous trio. “Up to no good, I’! bet,” he
thought. This suspicion flashed across his mind, but the next
instant the thought of his coming interview with the Japanese
returned and engaged his full attention. He smiled to himself
and nodded as he made up his mind to fall back on the only
way left open to him—to make every concession demanded of
him so long as he could keep the title of “proprietor.” Once he
lost this title, his creditors would descend on him in a swarm,
and he would be worse off than ever.

On the following day the doors of Chou Chung-wei’s match
factory opened again. Overnight he had copied out a new set
of regulations which had proved even more exacting than the
old ones. Two Japanese who could hardly speak Shanghai dia-
lect followed him into the factory, one as a technician and the
other as a supervisor.

Chou Chung-wei was beaming as he bounced to and fro and
showed the two new arrivals over the factory. Finally, he called
all his fifty or sixty employees together and made a speech:

“I promised you yesterday that I’d open the factory again, and
here we are! You can see I’m a man of my word! Although
the factory’s losing money, I’ve got to carry on. Why? First,
because if I closed down the factory you'd soon starve. But you're
Chinese, and I’m also Chinese. As a Chinese employer it’s up
to me to stand by my Chinese employees! The second reason
is that all the time the market’s being flooded with imported
matches, Chinese dollars are being drained out of the country into
the foreigners’ pockets—hundreds of millions a year! Now this
is a Chinese factory, and you're Chinese workers making Chinese
matches, so it’s up to you as Chinese workers to help your
Chinese employer! Production-costs are heavy, which makes
Chinese goods hard to sell. The best way you can help me is

to accept slightly lower wages. Then, once the factory starts
making money, we all shall be in clover. Now I, as a Chinese
employer, refuse to close down my factory, even though I’m los-
ing money, because it’s my duty to help my Chinese employees.
In the same way, it’s up to you as Chinese workers to help your
Chinese employer by working your hardest and keeping down
costs! That’s all. Long live Chinese factories!”

It was as much as the corpulent Chou Chung-wei could do
to get this last sentence out, for he was quite out of breath by
now. As he gasped out the final phrase, the word “factories”
trailed away into something like a sob. The veins stood out
on his round, flushed face despite its plumpness, and beads of
sweat rolled down his forehead.

The workers were as silent and expressionless as statues. As
he panted for breath, Chou Chung-wei tried to smile, and dis-
missed his audience with a flap of his hand. Before long, the
machines started rumbling and the matches began to come out
in bundles on the conveyor belts, which ran on and on like
never-ending cartridge-belts. As the belts ran on and on, so
did Chou Chung-wei’s thoughts: he was reviewing his life, epi-
sode by episode, stage by stage. He had begun as a compradore;
later, he had become a factory-owner—his own master; now
he was a compradore again—though a compradore of a different
kind, a mere figure-head! It had indeed been a dream, and now
the wheel had come full circle!

He suddenly laughed. Whatever happened, he could always
laugh.
XVII

TiERE was no wind. Scattered white clouds hung motionless
against the pale blue curtain of the sky, and a smiling moon
peeped down between the clouds at the secrets of the world
below. The Whangpoo was a glistening ribbon of drab yellow;
it flowed with a quict contentment. A steam-launch pushed its
leisurely way through the smooth waters of the river with an
occasional majestic hoot. Its deck was ablaze with a galaxy
of red and green lights which vied in the cool stillness of the
night with the stars shimmering overhead. It was evidently a
pleasure-boat.

The boat was now passing Kaochiaosha, where the river was
wide, and moving solemnly northwards, while the busy industrial
and commercial heart of Shanghai faded into the distance behind
it. The tall chimney of the power station, the last outpost of
industrial Shanghai, swept past in the twinkling of an eye. The
fields on either bank seemed veiled in a thin grey haze as they
slept in the moonlight.

The revellers on deck were mildly drunk. More than twenty
minutes of uninterrupted laughter and joking had tired their
tongues and they were now gazing out in silence at the mysterious
moonlit world around them, their wine-flushed faces gradually
taking on a look of frustrated boredom. Now that they were
temporarily removed from the vortex of business competition,
now that their eyes were suddenly opened to the quiet calm of
the moonlit countryside, it was only natural that they should
feel dejected as they licked the wounds they had received ia
the daily battles of the business world. In addition to the feeling
of frustrated boredom, they now began to feel pessimistic about
the vicissitudes of life and to itch with the desire for something
fresh to give them the excitement they needed.

One member of the party was suffering worse than the others
—Wu Sun-fu. Tonight’s celebration had been at his suggestion
and his guests were his old friends Sun Chi-jen, Wang Ho-fu,
and Han Meng-hsiang, as well as one woman, Hsu Man-li. It
was in her honour that this special party was being held, for,
according to her, it was at this hour of the rising of the moon
just twenty-four years before that she had first seen the light
in this weary world. The bunting and the coloured lights, the
wine and the expensive food, then, were all to celebrate her
birthday. In addition, Sun Chi-jen had wired his agent to send
down his new steam-launch for this special occasion.

The boat was going even slower now, and the engine chugged
monotonously beneath them as if it were singing a lullaby. The
skipper, sensing the mood of the party on deck, had cut down
the speed to please them, and the boat was now so steady that
one could have balanced an egg on one end on the deck.
Suddenly, Wu Sun-fu turned to Sun Chi-jen:

“How many knots can this boat do at full speed?”

“Oh, thirteen, I should think. She might even get up to
fifteen or sixteen when she’s drawing as little water as she is
now—though she’d roll like the very devil. Why—do you want
to go fast?”

Wu Sun-fu smiled and nodded. Sun Chi-jen had read his
thoughts and realized that his jaded spirits craved some violent
stimulus—speed, power, anything. But Wang Ho-fu disagreed
and offered a more practical suggestion:

“We're the only boat for miles; there’d ‘be no fun in racing
her here. Let’s go back along the Bund where there’s plenty
of life and bustle, and then give her her head. That’d be more
to the point!”

“There’s no need to go back so soon!” said Hsu Man-li in her
clear, tinkling voice. “Let’s run down to Woosung where the
river meets the sea before we turn back—and at full speed,
too!”

Everyone clapped their approval, for just before, when they
had been laughing and joking, they had agreed that the slightest
whim of the “guest of honour” should be their command. Ac-
cordingly, the order for full speed ahead was immediately given,
and the engine revved up and the boat began trembling as if

in the throes of malaria; white foam churned up a foot high
around the cutwater, and the bow-wave trailed out far across
the river in a long white V. The waters of the Whangpoo
splashed and gurgled around the laughing, wine-flushed party
on deck.

“We must do something to keep alive the memory of this gala
night!” shouted Han Meng-hsiang, holding his glass aloft. “I
suggest that Sun Chi-jen should rename this boat the Man-li.
All agreed?”

Just then the boat suddenly swerved and Han Meng-hsiang
lost his balance and fell against Wang Ho-fu, while the glass
of champagne splashed on Hsu Man-li’s head and drenched her
long, wavy hair. Exclamations of dismay came from Wu Sun-
fu and others, then everyone burst out laughing. As she laughed,
Hsu Man-li tried to shake the wine out of her hair and protested
in a coquettish voice:

“you are a clumsy oaf, Meng-hsiang! My hair’s soaked! Now
you'll have to suck it dry!”

She was only joking, but Wang Ho-fu pretended to take it
seriously and clapped his hands for silence.

“Did you hear that, everybody? Her Highness commands Han
Meng-hsiang to lap up the wine in her hair! It’s a great honour
to be entrusted with such a task, Meng-hsiang! You must carry
it out without delay—”

“Don't be silly!” interrupted Hsu Man-li, kicking at Wang Ho-
fu’s shin under the table to stop him. “I was only joking! I
didn’t mean it!”

Wang Ho-fu pretended not to hear and urged Han Meng-hsiang
all the harder to “Obey Her Highness at once!” Wu Sun-fu
and Sun Chi-jen clapped and cheered him on. Now that some-
thing new had come along to stimulate their jaded spirits, they
were unwilling to let it go, especially in their present state of
tipsiness. Han Meng-hsiang was smiling darkly and seemed to
have no objection. The only difficulty was that Hsu Man-li,
for all her rich experience of men, had become strangely shy.
She smiled woodenly and flashed a glance round the men's
faces: three pairs of eyes, bloodshot with drinking, watched her
closely, as if she were a monkey about to perform. She had a
fleeting sensation, a feeling that she was being used as a play-

thing, but this feeling was too short-lived to annoy her. She
pursed her lips in a smile and giggled. She found it rather em-
barrassing to be forced into a game of this sort and to be watched
over while she played it.

Nevertheless, Wang Ho-fu had already gone into action. He
held Han Meng-hsiang’s head between his hands and pushed it
close to Hsu Man-li’s face. She giggled and leant away, only
to find herself pushing against Wu Sun-fu’s shoulder. Laughing
noisily, Wu Sun-fu caught hold of her head and held it to Han
Meng-hsiang’s lips. Sun Chi-jen now assumed the role of master
of ceremonies and shouted above the noise of their laughter:

“Suck one! Suck two! Suck—three! Ceremony completed!”

“Thank you very much, the lot of you! Now my hair’s dirtier
than ever! First champagne and then this!’ she protested coyly
as she tidied her hair, then began giggling again. As if hoping
to carry the joke further, Wang Ho-fu quickly put in:

“All right, then, we’ have another try, but this time you
mustn’t pretend to be so shy!”

“That'll do!” said Wu Sun-fu, who felt the joke had gone far
enough and wanted a change. ‘“Man-li has broken the rules
herself, so I suggest we think up a punishment for her.”

Han Meng-hsiang, who was fond of dancing, suggested that
she should be made to dance a foxtrot, but Sun Chi-jen was afraid
there might be an accident on his boat and hurriedly objected.

“No, you can’t do that! The boat’s rolling terribly, and it’s
no joke to fall into the Whangpoo! Let’s let her off for now—
we can always think of something later on.”

The steam-launch had now reached the Woosung delta. Three
or four foreign warships were moored in the river, the lights
on top of their mainmasts gleaming against the sky like unusually
bright stars. The clear notes of a bugle-call came to their ears
from one of the ships. Then there was a sudden silence. As
far as the eye could see there was nothing but water and cold
moonlight. The launch slowed down as it swept round in a wide
circle at the river’s mouth, then headed back up the river towards
Shanghai. Suddenly Wang Ho-fu said in a serious voice:

“This afternoon two American gun-boats and three Japanese
torpedo-boats left for Hankow under urgent orders, though I
don’t know what for. Chi-jen, has your company had any

news from Changsha? I hear they’re in a tight spot there
again.”

“l’ve had a wire, but it doesn’t say anything much.”

“Perhaps they couldn’t give any details because of the cen-
sorship. So far as I can make out, the Reds are getting ready
to attack Changsha. Hem!”

“That’s just another Japanese rumour,” said Han Meng-hsiang.
“The Japanese news agency’s always harping on the ‘Red menace
in Kiangsi and Hunan,’ and telling us that Changsha is threatened
—and Chian, too. The rumour was going round the Exchange
today, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting the market at all. In
fact, the market’s quite steady today!”

He yawned, and the yawn proved infectious: Hsu Man-li was
the first to go down, and Sun Chi-jen came precariously near it,
but managed to suppress it. He turned to Wu Sun-fu.

“Everything the Japanese say isn’t necessarily a rumour,
though. As a matter of fact, both those two provinces are in
a bad way. With the war between the North and the South
dragging on and on, they keep sending troops from the two
provinces to the front, and never send any back to replace them.
As the garrisons become depleted, they find it more and more
difficult to cope with the Reds, who're just overrunning the
whole place. There’s no telling how it’s all going to end!”

“Yes, it’s a job to say what's going to come of it all,” Wu
Sun-fu agreed. “When the war first broke out, everybody ex-
pected that it would be over in two months at the latest, but
here we are in the third month and still the end’s not in sight.
Though the casualties at the front are really frightful! They
even make an old campaigner like Colonel Lei shake his head
when you mention them. These army people have estimated
that the total number of men called up by both sides is three
million, and that the number of casualties to date is at least
three hundred thousand! It must be the biggest war we've ever
had!”

As Wu Sun-fu said this, he looked thoroughly dispirited; his
eyes were closed, and he was stroking his chin. Hsu Man-li, who
had not spoken for some time, suddenly joined in the conversa-

tion.

“Oh, they’re a terrible sight, all these wounded soldiers! They
just don’t look like human beings! Ship after ship and train
after train of them, every day they’re coming in! Just look at
all the military hospitals along the railways to Nanking and
Hangchow—every city and town is full of them. When the
temples are full they put them in the guildhalls, and when the
guildhalls are full they put them in the schools. Sometimes
there’s nowhere to put them, so they just have to stay on station
platforms for days on end in the wind and rain! Soochow and
Hangchow were always called paradises on earth, but just at
the moment these two cities are more like hell with all the
wounded soldiers they’ve got!”

“I should think the war will be over by the end of July,
though,” Wu Sun-fu said optimistically, forcing a smile. “They
can’t go on much longer with casualties as heavy as that!”

Wang Ho-fu shook his head in disagreement.

“Not necessarily, ’m afraid! I’ve heard that they’re digging
the most up-to-date kind of defence-works all round Hsuchow
under the supervision of a foreign military adviser. He guaran-
tees that the Central Army can hold this defence-line for at least
a year! Just think, another year! They say that this defence-
line alone will cost three million dollars—some say five million!
So it looks as if the war will still be on when New Year’s Day
comes round. What a mess!”

“However heavy the casualties are, there are plenty of new
recruits to replace them!” said Han Meng-hsiang. “There are
recruiting stations at Chinkiang, Soochow, Hangchow and Ningpo,
and each station pulls in from three hundred to a thousand men
every day and sends them up to Shanghai and then on to Nanking
for training. They’ve also got a recruiting banner up in Shang-
hai North Railway Station; they enrol a matter of two or three
hundred recruits every day there!”

Whether he realized it or not, Han Meng-hsiang had dealt
a mortal blow to Wu Sun-fu’s optimism with this.

A silence fell over the party. Was the civil war going to drag
on indefinitely? This was the question which lay behind the
glances that passed between the five of them. The chugging of
the engine had now changed to a higher, softer key, and every
beat jabbed at their frayed nerves and added to their depression

With Hsu Man-li and Han Meng-hsiang this depression was
nothing more than a passing mood which quickly evaporated; but
it had come to stay with the other three—Wu Sun-fu, Sun Chi-
jen and Wang Ho-fu—and became worse as time went on. If
the war should drag on for a long time yet, their businesses would
be ruined!

A thin mist now hung over the river, and in the distance
lightning flashed and thunder began to rumble. The wind was
rising, a violent southeaster which met them head-on. The
steam-launch forged angrily ahead in the teeth of the wind,
and battled against the noisy onslaught of the waves. Presently,
the gay, twinkling lights of Shanghai could be seen coming nearer
and nearer through the thin mist.

“What a miserable lot we are!’ came Hsu Man-li’s tinkling
voice, breaking the tense, gloomy atmosphere with its cheerful-
ness. “What’s the matter with you all? Have you been struck
dumb?”

It annoyed her to think that their evening of gaiety had been
marred by the mention of wounded soldiers and defence-lines,
and she was now determined to use all her charm to dispel the
awkward silence that hung over them. Han Meng-hsiang was,
as usual, quick to respond.

“Let’s have one drink all round,” he suggested, “and then each
of us in turn drinks a toast to our guest of honour. How’s that?”

No one disagreed with this suggestion. Though Wu Sun-fu
and his companions realized that it would take more than a
few drinks to dispel their low spirits, they were agreeable to
having a drink if only to take their minds off their troubles for
one brief moment and replace their depression with a temporary
gaiety. When the toasts had been drunk, Wang Ho-fu was ready
with another suggestion.

“So much for the drinks; now for a bit of fun! Chi-jen, you
tell the skipper to order full speed ahead—as fast as she'll
go! Man-li, you stand on the table on one leg and keep the
other leg up.—You needn’t be afraid of falling off, because we'll
stand one on each side of the table. If you fall, the one who
catches you will have good luck all the year and make his fortune
this month!”

“No, I can’t do a thing like that!” she protested coyly. “We're
just coming into the busy part of the river, and I don’t want to
make a fool of myself!”

She turned to slip away, but the four men just laughed and
applauded her insistently. Still laughing, Wu Sun-fu grasped
her unexpectedly round the waist and planted her on the table
with a thud. He held her there to stop her getting down and
called to the others:

“Every man to his post! And remember, Man-li, no favour-
itism! Come on, everybody!”

There was no escape for her now, and she did not want to
escape, but she was laughing so much that she felt weak at the
knees and could not even stand up. The four men took up their
positions, roaring with laughter and urging her on. The boat
was now racing madly like a runaway horse. Hsu Man-li had
only just stood up and raised one leg, when a gust of wind
caught her dress and blew it up over her face. She gave a lurch
and toppled towards one corner, where she was caught by Sun
Chi-jen and Han Meng-hsiang together.

“That’s the first prize gone!” laughed Wang Ho-fu, clapping
his hands. “Half each! Up you go again and we'll see who gets
the second prize!”

Just then, a sudden blast from the boat’s siren startled the
merry-makers and the next moment the boat jarred violently
against something and seemed to rear up in the water. The
sudden jolt sent the glasses and dishes on the table crashing to
the deck. Everyone was thrown off balance, and Han Meng-
hsiang, who was near the side, nearly went overboard. They
were all pale with fright. The boat had stopped, and members
of the crew were running along the sides with long bamboo poles
in their hands. A muffled shout came from the river:

“Help! Help!”

The launch had hit a sampan and overturned it. Now Hsu
Man-li could not give the “second prize.” Wu Sun-fu frowned
and smiled grimly to himself.

One of the crew managed to hook the sampan with his bamboo
pole. In the water, clinging to the stern of the sampan was a
man with only his head showing above the water. He was the
sampan man, the only one who had fallen into the water. Ten

minutes later, the launch was speeding on its way again and
heading for the Customs Jetty. The five people on deck were
laughing noisily once again: they dared not stop, for if they
did they would immediately find themselves in the grip of a
terrible despondency and the frightening uncertainties of the
military situation and the crisis in business and industry would
again be growing at their minds.

*

It was midnight. Most of the inhabitants of the industrial
and financial world of Shanghai were already asleep and groan-
ing through nightmares of cut-throat competition, but the bar
of the night club still echoed with the clinking of knives and
forks and the popping of corks. Wu Sun-fu was gazing absently
at the people passing by him in the bar, his left hand support-
ing his chin, and his right over the top of a wineglass. He and
Wang Ho-fu had got through half a bottle of port between them,
but their faces were not flushed in the least. The port might
have been so much pure water for all the effect it had on their
jaded spirits. To make things worse, they had no idea why they
should feel so depressed.

After landing at the Customs Jetty, they had all gone off to
Hsu Man-li’s place and spent an hilarious half-hour there. After
that they had paid a visit to the famous house of romance known
as No. 94, where they had set Madame a very difficult task.
Finally they had come to this night club, where they had spent
the last half-hour. They had played cards and dice, but none
of these amusements had been of the slightest use in reviving
their spirits. They sat there as depressed as ever, feeling as if
their chests were congested and making their breathing difficult.
They felt prickly all over and it was an effort to move. What
irked them most was that their usually alert minds seemed
clogged and numb. Only the strongest stimulus could rouse them
to mental activity, and then only for a moment.

“Whew! I feel whacked!” Wu Sun-fu muttered to himself
and took a sip at his glass. He was still staring dazedly at the
blurred shapes passing in and out of the bar.

“I feel washed out, too,” yawned Wang Ho-fu. “Felt washed
out for the last five or six days.”

Their eyes met and parted at once, and each resumed his
absent-minded staring. They might just as well have not spoken,
for neither of them was really conscious of what they were
saying or hearing. In fact, their conscious minds were a com-
plete blank.

Suddenly, a tall, sturdy figure appeared in the doorway with
three or four people clustered round him. They brushed past
Wu Sun-fu’s table, talking and laughing, and vanished into the
room at the back of the bar. This sudden irruption seemed to
jar the numbed nerves of Wu Sun-fu and Wang Ho-fu back to
life, for they exchanged glances and smiled dismally at each
other. Wu Sun-fu muttered as if to himself:

“Wonder if it was. Looked like Chao Po-tao.”

“Chao Po-tao?” echoed Wang Ho-fu, instinctively glancing
towards the door of the backroom, then asked:

“Who were the others?”

“I didn’t notice. Anyway, I didn’t see the old chap among
them — Shang Chung-li.”

“I saw somebody wearing glasses. What’s his name, now—
that’s it, Li Yu-ting, the one who’s always at your place.”

“Are you sure it’s him?” said Wu Sun-fu, then chuckled and
picked up his glass for another sip. Just then the man in
glasses came out of the backroom and came straight across to
their table. It was Li Yu-ting, after all. He had come back
specially to pay his respects to the two men of property. Wang
Ho-fu laughed.

“Talk of the devil! Fancy meeting a university professor in
a night club! Il) have it put in the papers tomorrow!”

“Don’t worry! Our lawyer friend Chiu Chun dragged me
here. Have you seen him?”

“No, but we saw Chao Po-tao when you came with him a
minute ago.”

At this chance remark of Wu Sun-fu’s Li Yu-ting unexpectedly
blushed to the tips of his ears. He felt as guilty and embarrassed
as a woman whose husband has caught her with a lover. He
forced a smile and hurriedly changed the subject:

“IT hear the government’s moving to Hangchow. It may only
be a rumour, but everybody’s talking about it. Haven’t you
heard about it?”

Wu Sun-fu and Wang Ho-fu shook their heads. They received
the news with a curious mixture of delight and despondency.
Li Yu-ting went on:

“The fact that the North's going to set up their own govern-
ment, and that the Central Government's moving to Hangchow,
means that neither side’s willing to make peace and that they’re
both determined to fight it out. I tell you, Sun-fu, the war’s
going to drag on—perhaps even six months or a year! It’s going
to be the worst stretch of fighting since the republic was set up.
There’s never been such a vast number of men called up before,
and the front line is so long that all the central provinces have
been caught in the maelstrom. And then there are the Reds
making havoc everywhere. In fact, the outlook couldn’t be
blacker!”

“We'll manage somehow!” Wang Ho-fu said with a sigh. He
was more disheartened now than he had ever been. Li Yu-
ting felt sorry for him. He turned to look at Wu Sun-fu and
saw a face as worried as Wang Ho-fu’s. Li Yu-ting had never
seen Wu Sun-fu looking as miserable as this before. He sighed
despite himself and tried to think of something to say to dispel
the unpleasant atmosphere that hung over them. Presently he
spoke again:

“Por all that the stock market’s still firm: no sign of a slump
yet. That shows that the general public are still quite optimistic
about the future!”

“Ha ha! You’re right they are!” Wu Sun-fu laughed with a
sudden bitterness. He gave Wang Ho-fu a knowing look. Wang
Ho-fu missed it, but Li Yu-ting noticed it and realized at once
that he had inadvertently touched Wu Sun-fu’s tender spot. He
quickly tried to pass it off with a forced laugh and changed the
subject again, this time to Chiu Chun, the lawyer.

“A native bank down in Nantao went broke, over four hundred
thousand dollars in debt, Four-fifths of the money belongs to
the depositors, who are getting Chiu Chun to sue the bank for
them. As a matter of fact, Sun-fu, your relative Fan Po-wen
happens to be one of the claimants. I hear he's reading up civil
law now, instead of writing poetry. They say the bank lost a lot
in the stock market.”

Wu Sun-fu nodded and smiled. He was amused to hear that
it had taken the loss of his bank deposits to make Fan Po-wen
take up law. Wang Ho-fu said cynically, “If nobody ever went
broke, nobody would ever make a fortune! It’s hard luck on the
small depositors, though!”

“Yes, it is,” agreed Li Yu-ting. “My own feeling is that for
the last few years the money business in Shanghai has been
developing in the wrong direction. I think the development of
industry is the only use of money which will benefit the nation’s
economy. As it is, industry in this city is going from bad to
worse. A case in point is the cigarette industry—during the last
two or three years quite a large number of new cigarette fac-
tories have sprung up in Shanghai, but they soon find they
haven’t a chance against foreign competition. And now, on top
of that, they’re being hit by the war. Even the China Tobacco
Company, with the best-known brands and the biggest capital,
is shutting down its Shanghai factory for the time being. Such
is the fate of the luxury industries.”

Having finished his impassioned harangue, Li Yu-ting stood
up to go, then suddenly bent down and whispered in Wu Sun-
fu’s ear:

“Chao Po-tao’s got something big up his sleeve. He wants to
talk it over with you. I wonder if you mind coming into the
backroom? It’s quieter in there than it is here.”

Wu Sun-fu was rather taken aback for the moment, and did
not reply at once. Li Yu-ting chuckled as much as to say, “Think
it over” and walked off.

For a moment Wu Sun-fu just sat there gazing at Li Yu-ting’s
receding back. He was puzzled. Why should Chao Po-tao want
to see him all of a sudden? And why should Li Yu-ting be so
furtive about it, as if he did not want Wang Ho-fu to hear? He
glanced round at Wang Ho-fu and decided he had better go and
see what Chao Po-tao’s game was.

“Ho-fu, Li Yu-ting’s just told me that Chao Po-tao’s got some-
thing to discuss with us. Let’s go through and see him.”

“Oh, I don’t think you’ll need me. I’m going to have a look
at the roulette table. So Chao Po-tao’s playing the Napoleon,
eh? He’s won his battle and now he’s going to dictate his terms!”’

The two men glanced at each other and laughed as if they
felt some slight relief from their depression.

So Wu Sun-fu went alone. He found Chao Po-tao at a small
table tucked away in a corner and sat down with him, trying
his best to smile calmly. Since their joint speculation in govern-
ment bonds a month before the two of them had met from time
to time at social functions, but had never exchanged more than a
few casual words. Now they had met once again for a serious
private discussion. Chao Po-tao was his usual cheerful, straight-
forward self. He did not beat about the bush, and made no at-
tempt to disguise the fact that he knew he had finally won.

“I'll be quite frank with you, Sun-fu. It’s time we wrote off
all our old scores! Though there are one or two things I must
clear up before we start. In the first place, I admit I’ve had a
hand in organizing a banking consortium—a sort of a trust, if
you like. It’s a fairly comprehensive sort of thing, but we’re not
barring anybody who wants to go in with us and we don’t
necessarily intend to swallow anybody who prefers to go ahead
on his own. We've never at any time tried to bring pressure to
bear on you, Sun-fu, and we’ve never had any real interest in
the silk industry. If you’ve been imagining that we've got
designs on you, Sun-fu, then you've got a suspicious mind!—”

Wu Sun-fu smiled and shrugged his shoulders. Chao Po-tao
did not return his smile, and his keen eyes searched Wu Sun-fu’s
face. He drew hard at his cigar and went on:

“You don’t believe me, Sun-fu? Just as you like, Though
T’ll tell you this: I was only pulling your Jeg with all that
business about Chu Yin-chiu’s loan. The last thing I want is
to make things awkward for you! If you imagined that I had
some ulterior motive, well, that’s quite understandable—I’d
probably react in the same way if I were in your place. And
now let's pass on to the other thing. You people suspect that
I’m leaving no stone unturned to wreck the Yi Chung Company.
Ha ha! Yes, I admit I’ve done some underhand things, but only
on a very small scale, never anything serious. You think I'm
enforcing an ‘economic blockade’ against you behind the scenes:
yes, Sun-fu, I expect I could if I really wanted to, but as it hap-
pens I don’t want to! It would be pointless to stab you in the
back when you're one of us!”

“Ha ha! { see, Po-tao, it seems we've all been wronging you!
All one big misunderstanding, eh?”

Wu Sun-fu raised his eyebrows as he laughed, but Chao Po-tao’s
expression remained serious.

“Not at all!” he quickly replied. “I don’t mean that you’ve mis-
understood every single thing I've done in the past. I only want
to make you understand that we’re not necessarily inveterate
enemies, that we haven’t necessarily got to go two entirely dif-
ferent ways, and that there’s room for both of us in this world.
You see, even if your company prospers, it doesn’t mean to say
that I’m going to lose by it, so why should I go to the trouble of
making every effort to thwart you? As a matter of fact, I’ve
never tried to do anything of the sort!”

Chao Po-tao’s gloating tone of voice was more than Wu Sun-fu
could bear, and he demanded acidly, “Surely you didn’t send for
me just to tell me all this, Po-tao?”

“Partly, yes. All right then, Sun-fu, let bygones be bygones.
— Actually, there was something else I wanted to talk over at
the same time, but as you seem fed up with the sound of my voice
I don’t think I should bother you with it. You know me, Sun-fu:
I like to have things straight out and not beat about the bush.
The reason I asked you over was to see whether we couldn't get
together and co-operate from now on —”

“Now, Po-tao,” interrupted Wu Sun-fu, “if you've got something
else to talk over with me, let’s hear it.”

He put on a smile, trying to be calm, but he felt extremely
uneasy. He suddenly remembered Tu Chu-chai’s efforts at
mediation when he had first clashed with Chao Po-tac. At that
time he had insisted on a policy of “winning a victory before
negotiating a peace so that Chao Po-tao will never get the upper
hand,” and so had rejected Tu Chu-chai’s good offices, never ex-
pecting that their positions would be so quickly reversed and that
Chao Po-tao, as the victor, would be offering him a chance to
“co-operate” with him. Wu Sun-fu could scarcely believe that
fate could be so unkind to him.

With a faint smile, as if he could see what was going on in Wu
Sun-fu’s mind, Chao Po-tao said quite frankly:

“The third thing actually is a case of misunderstanding. You
think I’ve taken Tu Chu-chai away from you, whereas, in point

of fact, I’ve done nothing of the kind. On the other hand, you’ve
actually hooked Han Meng-hsiang from me! I don’t mind telling
you, Sun-fu, I couldn’t help admiring the skilful way you did it!”

As Wu Sun-fu listened, his heart thumped and a look of appre-
hension came into his face. He quickly tried to pass it off with
a loud laugh. Then he put out a feeler:

“Han Meng-hsiang’s not the only one! I’ve also bought over
someone even more important than him!”

“Oh yes, a woman, perhaps, but that doesn’t count for much.
I'd be extremely grateful if you would take some of them off my
hands! I’ve got more women than I know what to do with!”

It was now Chao Po-tao’s turn to laugh to hide his discomfiture,
but Wu Sun-fu was not deceived, and it was now his turn to feel
triumphant. His self-confidence was gradually returning and he
was managing to shake off his defeatist mood. He braced him-
self up and took the offensive by returning without more ado to
the question of “co-operation.”

“You're a good guesser! We've been quite successful with our
policy of buying people over! You kriow, Po-tao, I think even
you have got your price! Now I’m plain-spoken like you and I
don’t believe in wasting breath, so let's have your terms for
‘co-operation’ straight out. If they’re reasonable, I'll consider
them seriously.”

“Well, then, in a nutshell, I'll recommend a certain banking
consortium to make the Yi Chung Trust Company a loan of three
million dollars, the first instalment being half a million. The
condition is that all the assets of the company should be placed
with it as a security.”

Wu Sun-fu listened attentively, his eyes riveted on Chao Po-
tao’s face. When the latter had finished, Wu Sun-fu suddenly
threw back his head and roared with laughter, then shrugged his
shoulders. Chao Po-tao’s expression did not change; he puffed
calmly at his cigar and waited quietly for an answer. When his
laughter had subsided, Wu Sun-fu put on a serious expression
and exclaimed:

“you're joking, Po-tao! Our company’s policy is one of gradual
development—we'll expand our business as we go along. Ad-
mittedly we’ve got big things planned for the future, but just at

the moment we don’t really need a loan of three million. In fact,
we've got surplus capital that we can’t find a use for!”

“You’ve got me wrong, I’m afraid. The total amount of the
loan would be three million, but the first instalment will only
be a matter of half a million. How the second would be made
is left open. You're an old hand at the game, Sun-fu, so you
must probably understand that this loan would in actual fact be
a loan of half a million. The only thing is that the banking con-
sortium would have priority in making further loans to bring the
total up to three million if necessary.”

“But the company couldn’t even use a loan of half a million!”

“You sure?”

“Quite sure!” said Wu Sun-fu firmly, steeling himself to say it:
yet hardly were the words out of his mouth when his heart missed
a beat: he realized that Chao Po-tao was trying to trap him in
the same way as he himself had trapped Chu Yin-chiu just a short
while before! He realized that, if he refused, Chao Po-tao would
organize a full-scale financial blockade against the company in
real earnest. With the war dragging on and the eight factories
suffering from over-production, such a full-scale financial blockade
would give the Yi Chung Company a choice between closing down
their factories and selling out. Chao Po-tao’s offer, then, was
the first warning shot as his financial trust went into action!

Chao Po-tao smiled and blew out a cloud of smoke before press-
ing home the attack. “So we can’t co-operate after all! Your
company is a promising one, and it seems a pity to drive it on
to the rocks! You’ve put a lot of hard work into your company,
Sun-fu. I can’t see you letting it all go by the board! Why not
think it over carefully before you let me know what your answer
is? Now let’s be perfectly honest about it, Sun-fu: you know
as well as I do that your company is in financial difficulties.
There’s every prospect of the war dragging on and spreading to
other parts of the country, which means that the company’s fac-
tories won’t find a market for their products before the end of the
year. So think it over carefully, Sun-fu, and let me know what
you decide.”

“Mm-—” grunted Wu Sun-fu vaguely, as he suddenly suc-
cumbed. Something seemed to snap inside him and his strength
deserted him. His self-confidence had gone, and with it his will

to resist. One thought was going through his mind: What about
a conditional surrender?

Suddenly, he stood up, a wry smile on his lips. He had re-
captured something of his ebbing will-power and was determined
not to let Chao Po-tao see his dejection and his readiness to sur-
render. He clapped Chao Po-tao on the shoulder and said
cheerfully:

“Say what you will, Po-tao, we all have our own ideas about
the military situation! It may well be that something will hap-
pen which will bring the war to a sudden end! As far as our
company’s concerned, we don’t worry much about it. Still, we
don’t mind absorbing a little more capital when we can to ex-
pand the business. I'll put your suggestion to the board of direc-
tors tomorrow and see you again later.”

Wu Sun-fu rounded off the conversation with another roar of
laughter and slipped away before Chao Po-tao could say another
word. He went back to Wang Ho-fu and told him briefly what
it was all about, then sat there frowning. For quite a while
neither of them spoke. Presently, Wang Ho-fu muttered through
clenched teeth:

“PH be round at your place with Chi-jen tomorrow morning
for a conference!”

*

By the time Wu Sun-fu got home it was half past one in the
morning. Both stars and moon were hidden by the dark bank of
cloud that covered the sky, and in his gloomy garden the wind
was soughing mournfully among the trees. His wife and all the
others were still out, and the servants of both sexes were gam-
bling in the porter’s lodge, huddled together in a circle, and shout-
ing and laughing excitedly. They did not realize Wu Sun-fu
was home until the chauffeur had sounded the horn for the second
time. They immediately broke up in a panic and scurried back
to their various places of work. Wu Sun-fu had guessed what
was going on, and when he got out of the car his face was as
black as thunder, for he had strictly forbidden his servants to
gamble!

When he found that his wife and everybody else were out he
becam2 engrier still. “What sort of a home is this to come home
to? he roared as he stalked into the drawing-room and glared

at the furniture, the carpet, the tablecloths, the sofa-covers and
the curtains, searching for a pretext to vent his rage on the ser-
vants. As his angry voice rang through the house, the servants
looked apprehensively at one another. With the wind moaning
in the rustling trees outside, everything seemed to be conspiring
to make this imposing mansion gloomy and depressing.

An apprehensive Kao Sheng came in with an armful of “in
memoriam” scrolls which had been received in the course of the
day from friends and relatives (the memorial service for Old Mr.
Wu's death was approaching) and asked Wu Sun-fu whether he
would like to glance at them. He was greeted with such a storm
of abuse that he did not know whether to laugh or ery, and the
servants now knew for certain that “the Master” was in an uglier
mood than usual tonight.

Kao Sheng’s rash intrusion, however, had given Wu Sun-fu the
necessary outlet for his rage, and he now sprawled on a sofa, lost
in thought. He was not, of course, thinking about his father’s
memorial service, for it was still five days away, and anyway,
he had entrusted all the arrangements to his wife and sister: he
was recalling how he and his friends had conceived the idea of
setting up the Yi Chung Company on the day of the old man’s
funeral, Now, even before the memorial service had been held,
all their ambitious plans were going up in smoke!

He now went back in his imagination to the corner of the bar
in the night club and went over his conversation with Chao Po-
tao again. He recalled with a pounding heart every threat Chao
Po-tao had made and every word he had said. His opponent had
offered him a clear choice: to surrender to him or to see the Yi
Chung go bankrupt! These two alternatives chased each other
through his head in a merciless merry-go-round, so that he could
not tear himself away from them and think of a third way out.
His will to fight, to resist, had vanished without a trace. He was
no longer the man he had been two months before, at the funeral!
His enthusiasm for his business was now quite dead, and if he
wanted to save the Yi Chung Company, it only was because he
wanted to salvage the capital of two hundred thousand dollars
which he had put into the company. And it was only the thought
of losing this money that made him now decide that he had no
other way out but to surrender to Chao Po-tao!

“So that two months’ hard work just thrown away!? Wu Sun-
fu moaned to himself. His voice sounded strange in the silence
of the spacious room. It startled him, and he sprang up, unable
to believe that this weird sound had been his own voice, but there
was nobody else in the room. The strong lights shone full on
his face, and outside the windows were the shadowy shapes of a
couple of servants standing by in case they were needed. He
frowned and smiled grimly at himself. He lay down on the sofa
again and suddenly recalled what he had told Tu Chu-chai not
long before: “There are certain fly individuals in Shanghai who
take a tumble-down house, redecorate it and patch it up, and then
let it for a nice fat sum of key money. If the worst comes to the
worst, we can always follow their example and do the same with
the eight factories.... If we make a good job of redecorating them
and patching them up, even the great Chao Po-tao himself will
offer us a good price for them!” He had said this in jest, just
to talk Tu Chu-chai round, little knowing then that it would
prove to be an oracle! Wu Sun-fu could not repress a smile as
he thought of it. He was beginning to believe that everything
was pre-ordained and that human efforts made no difference!

This thought made him feel slightly calmer. He was begin-
ning to realize that Tu Chu-chai, timid though he was, could
sometimes be more far-sighted than he was, and so save himself
a lot of trouble. He now began working out the total value of
the assets of the Yi Chung Company and considering what terms
he should hold out for when it came to actual negotiations with
Chao Po-tao. Should he sell out for a lump sum and have done
with it, or should he mortgage it and have it on his hands for a
while? His mind began to revive and his face became flushed
again. He was now a different man not only from what he had
been two months before, when he had drawn up his gigantic
industrial plans, but also from what he had been only three hours
before, when he had sat on the deck of the launch craving for
excitement! He now had a “way out.” Though it meant sur-
rendering, it was much better than having no way out at all!

His reverie was interrupted when his younger sister Huei-
fang stole quietly in and stopped in front of him, gazing at him
with anxious eyes.

“Hullo, Huei-fang. Thought you’d be out,” he said casually
when he had made sure it actually was his sister and not his
imagination. He looked rather annoyed at the intrusion.

Huei-fang said nothing, but sat down in a chair beside him
and heaved a sigh. Wu Sun-fu frowned and was about to speak
sharply to her, but changed his mind. He forced a smile, intend-
ing to speak gently instead, but she spoke before he could.
“Sun-fu, I want to go back home to the country after father’s
memorial service!”

“What! Go back to the country?” Wu Sun-fu exclaimed in
amazement. He was quite at a loss to understand how such a
strange idea could suddenly have entered her head, and stared
at her in astonishment as she sat there, her face white and drawn.
She hung her head and after a while she mumbled:

“After all these years in the country with father I can’t settle
down in Shanghai—”

“Two months in Shanghai and you can’t settle down?” inter-
rupted Wu Sun-fu, then burst out laughing. He thought his
sister was being childish, but he was wrong. Huei-fang raised
her head and looked sharply at him. Her eyes had the same
imperious glint as her brother’s had when he was making a
decision. She and her brother shared the same stubborn nature,
except that she usually held it in check. Now, however, her
latent stubbornness was forcing itself to the fore.

“No, I can’t settle down! I’ve been here long enough to be
absolutely certain that I don’t like the place! It’s not that I don’t
like the house or the food or anything like that, it’s something
else that I can’t explain. Every day’s a nightmare—I just feel
on edge all the time. There doesn’t seem to be anything to do
all day and I always feel at a loose end! I’ve asked Pei-shan
and the others, and they said they never feel like that. I suppose
I’m not fit for Shanghai because I have always stayed in the
country!”

Huei-fang was exceptionally insistent this time. Suddenly her
eyes reddened and tears rolled down her cheeks.

“Well, Huei-fang—I—” Wu Sun-fu faltered, then stopped, not
knowing how to go on; his expression was strangely tender.
Though he usually treated his younger sister and brother in a
rather overbearing manner, he was very kind to them at heart

and he always strove to make their life a happy one in the way
he thought best, so it naturally upset him to hear his sister
complain of the dullness of her life, even though as an industrialist
he could hardly be expected to understand a young girl’s com-
plex psychological processes and emotional conflicts!

Huei-fang was a sensitive girl, and her brother’s gentle ex-
pression suddenly reminded her of her mother and of the loving
care she had lavished on her when she was alive. This was
the first time for ten years that she had known such warmth of
affection, for it was the one thing she had missed while looking
after her father all these years since her mother's death. Her
father had never been more to her than a teacher of religion, and
there had always existed between him and her an impassable
barrier, so it was not surprising that her brother’s new-found
gentleness should help to loosen her tongue.

“when I first came to Shanghai, Sun-fu, I was afraid of every-
body and everything. I was terribly nervous of meeting people
and going out. I’m not afraid any longer, but now I always
feel so bored and depressed. A little while ago Pei-yao taught
me to play mahjong, but I very soon got fed up with it. I feel
fidgety all the time, as if I want something, but I don’t really
know what it is I want. I just don’t seem to be able to interest
myself in anything. I’m just on edge ali the time!”

“Well, if you’ve no way of passing the time, Huei-fang,
why didn’t you go out with Pei-yao today for a change?”

Wu Sun-fu’s expression was gentler than ever now, almost
the look of a loving mother; but then the businessman in him
was becoming impatient with every passing minute.

“J just don’t like going out—” Huei-fang said softly. She
sighed, but did not go on. She could not bring herself to say
what she was going to say. After all, a brother was a brother,
especially when he was an elder brother who was usually very
stern and serious, and she could not very well expect him to
understand all the complicated things that were worrying her.
She hung her head and her eyes became moist again. Suddenly,
she saw in her mind’s-eye a young man and a girl—perhaps Tu
Hsin-to and Lin Pei-shan— talking and flirting quite naturally
with each other. They seemed so happy together, and she was
so lonely! She always felt there was a cord round her heart;

when or how it had come to be there she did not know, but it
was there all the time, binding her inside herself and preventing
her from being easy and natural with men and talking and
laughing with them. She hated this cord that bound her, but
she could not free herself from it. This was the struggle that
had been going on in her mind and causing her so much misery.
All she wanted was to hide herself away somewhere where she
could shut out the world and all the heartache it caused her.
But she had no one she could tell about her unhappiness. She
bit her lip, then looked up and said firmly:

“Sun-ful I'm sure in myself that the only way is for me to
go back to the country. There may be some other way out, but
this is the only one I can think of at the moment. There’s noth-
ing for it but to go back to the country! If I carry on like this,
PH go mad! I’ go mad, Sun-fu!”

“Eh? I've never heard of such a thing!”

“I know it sounds odd, but I just can’t understand why—”

“There’s nothing to worry about, Huei-fang. Just stick it for
a while and you'll find you'll get used to it. Look at Ah-hsuan,
he’s all right!”

Wu Sun-fu’s voice was taking on a tone of sternness now. He
shook himself impatiently and stood up, intending to put an end
to this dreary debate, but Huei-fang was adamant. She looked
her brother straight in the eye and said coldly, “If you won't
let me go home to the country, you can at least send me to a
lunatic asylum! I'll go mad sooner or later if I stay here!”

“Really, Huei-fang, I don’t know what to do with you! You're
old enough to understand, but you don’t seem to be able to!
Where do you imagine you’re going to live if you do go back?”

“I could live at our old home all right!”

“But won't you be even more miserable living alone there?”

“Well, I could go and live with Auntie at her place!”

Wu Sun-fu shook his head and snorted, then began pacing up
and down. He was quite at a loss to deal with this stubborn
sister of his, and he was becoming angry again! He had always
been accustomed to being in charge of things and having every
order promptly obeyed. Besides, he could not imagine why his
sister should want to run away from life in Shanghai. He
could only put it down to the fact that she had been living with

her father too long and had acquired some of his eccentricities,
one of which was an aversion to modern culture and city life.
As it happened, this particular prejudice of his father’s was
the one of which Wu Sun-fu had always most strongly disap-
proved. He suddenly stopped and turned to his sister again:

“Do you propose to hide yourself away in the country for
the rest of your life, then?”

“Not necessarily. One’s ideas can always change, you know.
But I think that for the moment at least the country’s a better
place for me than Shanghai.”

Wu Sun-fu could not help laughing, for he felt he had at last
found a chink in her armour, but before he could begin his
counter-attack, the blare of a motorcar horn came from the drive,
followed by a shout from Kao Sheng: “Mrs. Wu, Miss Lin and
the young master are back!”

Then came a burst of gay laughter and the click of high-heeled
shoes. The first one to burst into the drawing-room was Ah-
hsuan, brandishing a stage sword and laughing and fencing with
his new toy. He was obviously not expecting to find his brother
Sun-fu in the room, and when he turned and saw Sun-fu's
baleful glare on him his hand dropped to his side but he stood
there grinning impudently. Wu Sun-fu frowned as he remem-
bered the episode of the “throwing knife” and decided that this
sword was just a larger replacement. So Ah-hsuan was raising
the standard of rebellion against him, eh? He had stopped him
playing with his silly “throwing knife,” so he had had the cheek
to provide himself with an even more fearsome-looking weapon!
Who did he think he was?

His wife now walked in and realizing at a glance that Sun-fu
was about to fly into a rage at Ah-hsuan, she quickly put in a
word for him.

“It’s all right, Sun-fu, he didn’t buy the sword himself—Hsueh-
shih gave it to him. You see, Hsueh-shih's been taking an
interest in mediaeval knights or some such thing just lately.
He’s got a whole collection of swords and spears and things!”

“Pei-yao, what about the telegram from Fei Little Beard?”
Lin Pei-shan quickly put in to divert Wu Sun-fu’s attention.
“You've still got it in your handbag.”

Ah-hsuan made the most of this diversion to slip away, taking
his sword with him.

The telegram said that a dozen or so shops in Wu Sun-fu’s
home town had gone bankrupt all at the same time and that their
owners had gone into hiding, owing the various loca] banks a
total of more than three hundred thousand dollars. The local
bank owned by Wu Sun-fu was involved and now faced a crisis.
The telegram ended with an appeal for money to save the situa-
tion. Wu Sun-fu’s face fell and he sighed. Then, without a
word, he walked out and went to his study to write out a reply.
It read: “No money to spare. Do what you can.”

He was walking through a mine field! Wherever he trod
there might be an explosion!—Such were the thoughts that
tortured Wu Sun-fu’s feverish brain as he tossed and turned
in his bed, unable to sleep. His authority in society and even
in his own home was collapsing like a house of cards! The veins
on his temples throbbed, and the spring mattress underneath
him felt like a bed of nails. His wife was groaning and moaning
in her sleep again as she lay beside him.

He heard a muffled whistle somewhere in the distance, then
suddenly he saw his sister running towards him and shouting
that she must go back to the country and enter a nunnery, then
cutting off her hair until she was completely bald. His married
sister Fu-fang now appeared and began accusing him of ill-
treating Huei-fang and Ah-hsuan and demanding that he share
out the property he had inherited so that Huei-fang and Ah-
hsuan could set up their own homes. Suddenly, he saw Ah-
hsuan and a number of other people performing a sword-dance
in the drawing-room, while the garden swarmed with grotesque
giants. Finally, he found himself in a hotel, in bed with Liu
Yu-ying; she was flushed and giggling, and her soft white hand,
as hot as fire, was on his chest....

Wu Sun-fu laughed aloud in his sleep and stretched out his
arms to embrace a soft, warm body, then heard the sound of
soft, alluring laughter. All of a sudden, he opened his eyes. The
net curtains over the windows were splashed with morning sun-
light and shadows, and his wife was sitting on the edge of the
bed in a dressing-gown. She was smiling at him. He coloured
guiltily and quickly sat up. On a silver tray on the bedside table

a cup of hot milk was waiting for him, and beside it lay two
visiting cards—Wang Ho-fu and Sun Chi-jen. A skin had just
begun to form on the milk.

*

In the small drawing-room, Wu Sun-fu, Wang Ho-fu and Sun
Chi-jen were just beginning their highly important conference.
They first discussed Chao Po-tao’s offer in great detail, Wu Sun-
fu was inclined to accept it; Wang Ho-fu was non-committal;
Sun Chi-jen strongly opposed it. Swaying his long neck, Sun
Chi-jen said in a cool, firm voice:

“There are two things involved which we should consider
separately. One: if we sell the company to Chao Po-tao, can we
recover our capital? Two: do we need to sell it at all? I know
Sun-fu’s probably thinking that this consortium of Chao Po-tao’s
is the same thing as the finance trust that all the rumours have
been about all this time, but so far as I can see it’s all a hoax!
If there’s one thing Chao Po-tao can do, it’s to fabricate rumours!
He’s deliberately put round this rumour of a trust to cause a
panic and persuade people that they must either truckle to him
or go bankrupt! I suggest we tell him to go to the devil!”

“But, Chi-jen, all this talk of a trust can't be just a hoax.
Aren’t they already trying to get their hands on our company?”

“Don’t you believe it! Even if he can start handing out loans,
this finance trust of his is still nothing but a hoax! Every penny
Chao Po-tao possesses is tied up in government bonds: he just
hasn’t got the resources to go into partnership with the Ameri-
cans! He may possibly be in league with some foreigner or other
to make loans on security to Chinese factory owners, but even
if he is he’s nothing more than a broker. If we have factories
to sell, there’s nothing to stop us finding a buyer ourselves!
There’s no reason why we should do it through a broker!”

“You're quite right!” agreed Wang Ho-fu. “No matter how
formidable Chao Po-tao may appear to be, he’s only a broker in
disguise! In all these joint enterprises with foreigners, the Chi-
nese are partners in name only: in actual fact they’re mere
brokers!”

Wu Sun-fu did not press his arguments, but he still seemed
rather ill at ease when he next spoke: “If we don’t find another
buyer and have to fall back on Chao Po-tao later on, he’ll just

play cat-and-mouse with us. If we don’t toe the line, he'll
really enforce a financial blockade against us and we'll be in a
worse jam than ever. Have you got anybody else in mind, Chi-
jen?”

“Not at the moment, but we're pretty certain of finding
somebody once we start looking. I said a moment ago that the
question falls into two parts, so shall we now go on to the
second? What it boils down to is this: as things are now, how
much longer can our company hold out?”

Hardly were the words out of Sun Chi-jen’s mouth when Wang
Ho-fu shook his head pessimistically and Wu Sun-fu sighed and
began stroking his chin. The answer to this question could nol
be more obvious: while the war dragged on indefinitely, every
day that the eight factories remained open they were losing
money; so the question was, in fact, not whether they could
keep the factories open, but whether they wanted to. The an-
swer to this was that they did not, for they had long lost heart
over the whole project.

The three men looked at each other and smiled grimly. With
that smile they had thrown overboard the dream they had set
their whole hearts on for the past two months and more. Feeling
that a mortgage would only prolong their misery, they decided
unanimously to sell out completely and have done with it. Sun
Chi-jen had two possible buyers in mind: a British firm and a
Japanese company.

After a while Wu Sun-fu laughed mirthlessly. “‘He who
fights and runs away... !’ Anyway, it’s all the fault of the
war, not bad management on our part!”

Wang Ho-fu laughed heartily; he felt as if a heavy burden
had been taken from his shoulders, and he was looking forward
to more restful nights from now on. Sun Chi-jen, however,
looked serious and absorbed, as if he was working something
out. Suddenly, he slapped his thigh and looked gleefully at his
two partners.

“The eight factories, including buildings, machinery, raw
materials and finished goods, should fetch six hundred thousand
dollars. That's without taking into account the seventy thousand
in cash deposits in the company. Yes, I think we can get our
capital back all right. With the factories gone, we shall have

the empty shell of the company left, so we'll be able to carry
on absorbing deposits and biding our time until we see an op-
portunity of going in again. Yun-shan said in his last telegram
that he could find some share capital in Hongkong. I think we'd
better send him another wire and tell him to go ahead and get
as much as he can! Another thing, Sun-fu: we failed over the
factories because of the war, but the war offers us an excellent
opportunity for stock-jobbing! What about shifting our capital
from factories to government bonds? It’s time we had another
tussle with Chao Po-tao!:

As he listened, Wu Sun-fu nodded his agreement. A warm
glow of courage spread through him once more until his finger-
tips quivered. They had been doing fairly well in government
bond speculation of late, and now, with a female spy in his
service, he should be able to take the enemy by surprise. He
decided to take the plunge.

“Let’s start right away then, neck or nothing! There’s been a
slight rise the last few days, put that’s because the bulls have
been at work. If the war drags on like this, the three govern-
ment lines—Tariff, Disbandment and Army Reorganization—are
bound to drop sooner or later, perhaps as much as thirty per
cent. I suggest we sell several hundred thousand today!”

“Agreed!” said Wang Ho-fu, twirling his beard elatedly. “That’s
just what I was going to suggest!”

In the past they had managed to run factories and do stock-
jobbing at the same time, and even so they had weathered two
violent storms on the Exchange without coming to grief, so it
was quite natural that they should feel supremely confident now
that they were going to concentrate all their capital and energy
on stock-jobbing alone. There was no reason whatsoever why
they should not feel optimistic about their chances. Their con-
ference came to an end in an atmosphere of excitement and
hope with a final enthusiastic contribution from Sun Chi-jen.

‘Right, then: I'll start looking for a buyer straight away!
Whether we get one or several offers, our total price is fixed at
five hundred and twenty thousand dollars. They can take it or
leave it! The company will remain in existence, but only for
deposit accounts. Ho-fu, you’d better chase up that prospect of
yours and get that hundred-thousand-dollar deposit. We can

do ‘savings,’ too. And you'd better keep in touch with Huang
Fen as well, Ho-fu, for any tips he can give us. Last but not
least is the job of dealing with the Stock Exchange side. I’m
afraid you’ll have to undertake that, Sun-fu: nobody else could
manage it!”

When his two partners had left, Wu Sun-fu immediately busied
himself with the telephone. He first got on to his broker Lu
Kuang-shih and then gave Han Meng-hsiang his instructions.
The news from the Exchange was encouraging, and it seemed
that his luck was holding, but he decided to wait until he had
got a report from his spy Liu Yu-ying before finally deciding
how much to sell. As he rang here, there and everywhere trying
to find the elusive Liu Yu-ying, he even forgot that he was
getting hungry.

At eleven o’clock Wu Sun-fu’s car was moving slowly off down
the asphalt drive towards the gate. Flushed with excitement,
he was off in person to the front line in the Exchange! As they
neared the gate the engine stalled. The chauffeur got out and
cranked it up, but it just coughed and stopped again. “A bad
omen!” thought Wu Sun-fu, though he had always flattered
himself that he was not superstitious. Irritably, he got out of
the car and was just going back indoors when a horn blared out-
side the gate and a car came up the drive. The visitors were
Tu Chu-chai and his wife.

Mrs. Tu had come specially to see her brother about the
memorial service for their late father. She came straight to the
point. “The sutra-chanting ceremony is going to be held in the
Jade Buddha Temple tomorrow, so we'd better go over today and
have a look at the ceremony hall.”

“Er, yes, I know, but—look, Fu-fang, I’m afraid you'll have
to go without me. I’m just off on some urgent business. If the
ear hadn’t broken down, I’d be gone by now.”

Wu Sun-fu frowned as he spoke, then glanced at Tu Chu-chai.
He had suddenly had an idea: if only he could draw Tu Chu-chai
into an alliance with him on the Exchange, he would then be
in a really strong position and Chao Po-tao wouldn't stand a
chance! But how could he best go about it? Wu Sun-fu im-
mediately began racking his brains.

“All right,” said Fu-fang. “I can go along with Pei-yao. But
you’d better be there at nine o’clock tomorrow morning to burn
the incense when they start! And Pei-yao, Huei-fang and Ah-
hsuan will have to be there, too!”

“Ah! Speaking of Huei-fang,” said Wu Sun-fu, ‘she wants
to go back to the country of all places! I just can’t make her
see sense!” He had missed the first part of what Mrs. Tu had
said, but the mention of Huei-fang’s name had registered and
reminded him of this particular worry of his.

Mrs. Tu did not seem in the least surprised, and said in quite
a matter-of-fact tone of voice, “Oh, young people are always
like that—they like to be on the move all the time. You get
fed up with Shanghai in no time at all and you soon want to go
down to the country for a little holiday!”

“It’s more than a little holiday that she wants! I thought you
might have a word with her, Fu-fang. Perhaps she’ll listen to
you. It beats me. I can’t make out what’s got into her. Any-
way, you'll find out all about it when you see her. It might
be some form of neurosis.”

Having got Mrs. Tu out of the way, Wu Sun-fu now turned
to Tu Chu-chai and began his negotiations for an alliance. He
talked glibly about the war dragging on for a long time yet and
pressed the point that, since the money raised on government
bonds was all going to military expenses, the bonds were bound
to drop: what a wonderful chance for the bears! He did not
openly suggest that Tu Chu-chai should join forces with him,
but just did his best to impress on him the advantage of selling
short. All he wanted was that Tu Chu-chai should do the same
as he was doing.

As he listened, Tu Chu-chai calmly took snuff and nodded, a
faint smile on his lips.
XVHI

HUEI-FANG had shut herself in her own room for the last two
days. She had taken this step as a final protest against Wu
Sun-fu’s refusal to let her go back home to the country after the
memorial service for her late father. No one had been able to
persuade her to leave her room, so they left her to her own
devices.

The Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments, which her
father had left her, was now her “talisman.” She had rummaged
out from the luggage the old man had brought with him to
Shanghai two months before an ancient incense-burner and
several bundles of high-quality incense. Her father had always
considered these accessories essential for the ritual reading of
the Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments. She had now
begun to say her prayers three times a day—morning, afternoon
and evening—and each time she burned incense. Having failed
to find her father’s prayer-cushion, she had no alternative but
to make do with sitting on a sofa with her legs tucked under her.

After careful consideration she had decided to embrace her
father’s religious teachings. This did not mean that she wished
to “lay up treasure in Heaven,” but she hoped that her religious
exercises would enable her to “cleanse her heart” and “subdue
desire,” and so help to alleviate her mental anguish. Her first
day had been quite successful. As she sat there intoning the
verses of the book with the blue smoke from the incense curling
round her, she could imagine herself back in the study of her
old home. Her father’s pious -face floated before her, and she
was so overcome that her eyes filled with tears. Sweet memories
came flooding back, vivid to the minutest detail, of the simple,
peaceful life she had led when she had looked after her aged
father in their old home; and she derived from these memories

a peace of mind she had never known before. A contented smile
played round her lips and the sacred verses lay unread before
her. Lulled by the fragrance of the incense, she sank limply
against the back of the sofa and fell into a trance, no longer
thinking or conscious of anything. And so she remained until
at long last the incense had burnt out; then she sighed as if she
had woken up again, and smiled faintly.

It was in this fashion, lost in dreams and memories, that Huei-
fang passed her first day of prayer and meditation, unconscious
even of the pangs of hunger.

But by the afternoon of the second day the scriptures and the
incense began to lose their mysterious power. Her memories
came back as they had the day before, but today she did not
relish them so much, and began to feel about them the way one
feels about an old friend whom one meets after a long absence,
who is welcome on the first day but whose company begins to
pall on the second. Though she dutifully continued to chant
the scriptures over and over again and meditate with her eyes
fixed on the tip of her nose and her nose pointing at her heart,
nevertheless all sorts of noises forced their way into her unwill-
ing ears and distracted her attention: a car hooting in the street
outside, a man’s heavy footsteps going past her door, the distant
tinkling of the piano in the drawing-room downstairs, the sound
of men and women talking and laughing happily together. By
the time the first stick of incense had burnt down, the sofa
began to feel prickly and the air seemed so close that she thought
she would suffocate. She struggled with a desire to go out and
have a look round, though what it was she wanted to look at
she did not know. Eventually she seemed to settle down again.
She picked up the book written in her father’s pious hand and
stared at it with drooping head. She sighed over and over again,
and her eyes became moist.

That night, it was a long time before she could get to sleep,
and when she finally did drop off she was troubled by dreams,
the sort of wild dreams which had often disturbed her rest be-
fore, and from which she always woke sobbing and crying. Now
they came back again, one after the other, till she tossed and
turned in a semi-conscious daze. Several times during that short
summer night she started up from her sleep in terror.

When she got up next morning her face was pale and drawn,
her finger-tips icy cold, and her heart weak and trembling. The
verses of the Supreme Book of Rewards and Punishments
seemed to mock at her as she read, and several times she closed
it and sighed.

The afternoon was hot and close, and Huei-fang felt as un-
comfortable as an earthworm on a hot brick. She lit a stick
of incense and picked up the book for her afternoon prayers
but her ears rang with noises from the house, from the garden,
and from the distant street. Her mind seemed to be analysing
and interpreting every little sound. Every time footsteps went
past the door her ears pricked up and her heart beat faster. She
sat with tears in her eyes, hoping desperately that the footsteps
would stop at her door, hoping desperately to hear a tap on the
door, so that she might run across and open it to her brother,
her sister-in-law—or even Pei-shan, coming to persuade her
to go out with them!

But every time she was disappointed. Every time the foot-
steps went straight past the door and never came back again.
She had been forgotten, cast aside like an old-fashioned dress!
As she sat there with the blue smoke of the incense curling
round her and the book in her hands, she began to feel resent-
ful towards her brother, her sister-in-law, even towards Lin Pei-
shan, who was always as happy as a lark. She felt that every-
body was free and happy except her, and she was forgotten, de-
prived of her freedom and happiness! She felt that her present
seclusion was not of her own free will: they had forced her
to it. They were plotting against her and using this subtle meth-
od to deprive her of her human rights!

She remembered a tragic story she had heard when she had
been living at her old home: a young lady “of good family” like
herself had been locked up indoors by her parents for “unseemly
behaviour,” and the story was put around that she had gone
into voluntary seclusion for “meditation?’ The girl had even-
tually hanged herself. “Isn’t that exactly what’s happening to
me?” She felt a thrill of horror as she thought of it. Suddenly,
she remembered a dream she had had the night before, a dream
which she had had several times and which had become so
familiar to her by now that she almost accepted it as Teality.

The dream seemed to refer to one evening about three weeks
ago. She was alone with Fan Po-wen in the hexagonal pavilion
on the artificial hill on the other side of the pond in the garden.
A storm was gathering in the sky. They chatted together for
a while and afterwards she lost her virginity in the darkness
of the pavilion. Of all the wild dreams that came to haunt her,
one always stood out from the rest and seemed quite real to her,
and that was the dream which takes place in the pavilion on that
stormy night. As the rain roars on the roof of the pavilion she
lies languidly back in an easy-chair with Fan Po-wen sitting
opposite. As she sits there with her eyes closed, she hears him
come across to her. Suddenly, she goes limp all over, intoxicated
and unresisting.

She suddenly screamed, and the book fell to the floor. She
automatically bent to pick it up and looked nervously all round.
There was a strained smile on her lips and two tear-drops
glistened on her lashes. She was firmly convinced that this
romantic dream had actually happened and that it was for this
misbehaviour that they were confining her to her room, while
telling the world outside that it was “voluntary seclusion!” It
seemed there was only one way out for her as there had been
for the other girl—suicide by swallowing a piece of gold or hang-
ing herself!

She even persuaded herself that, even if she herself did not
wish to end her life like this, her tyrant of a brother would
sooner or later come in and force her to do so. Her heart pounded
madly at the thought and her finger-tips felt icy, but her face
was burning. She asked herself through clenched teeth: “Why
should I have all the bad luck? Why should I be treated dif-
ferently from everybody else? Why shvuld the other girls be
allowed to go out with boys just as they like? Why should they
pretend not to notice the way Pei-shan goes on? Why should
I give in and let them treat me like this? But what can I do
about it? There must be another way out!” She stood up ab-
ruptly, her whole being ablaze with the fire of rebellion. But
the next moment she flopped down on the sofa again. She was
alone in the world, with no one to go to for advice, no one to
help her!

Suddenly, hurried footsteps pattered along to the door of her
room and stopped. There was a sharp rap on the door. She
was convinced that it was her brother coming to force her to
take her own life. With a despairing sigh she threw herself
on the bed and buried her face in the pillow, her blood freezing
in her veins.

“Huei-fang! Are you asleep?” came a girl's shrill voice in
her ear. Huei-fang jerked round in surprise to find her vivacious
cousin Chang Su-su standing by the side of the bed. She must
be dreaming again! She rubbed her eyes and looked again, then
suddenly sprang up, grasped Chang Su-su’s hand, and burst into
tears. Ata time like this she would have welcomed any visitor
at all with open arms—even a cat or a dog!

Chang Su-su was too surprised to do anything but laugh. She
sat down on the edge of the bed, shook Huei-fang by the shoulder,
and asked impatiently, “Why, what’s the matter with you, Huei-
fang? Why do you burst into tears the moment you see me?
Are you ill or something? Why don’t you say something?”

“It’s all right, there’s nothing the matter with me,” said Huei-
fang, shaking her head and forcing back her tears. She felt a
little better now that she knew she was not dreaming and that
it really was Chang Su-su who had come to see her.

“I really can’t understand you, Huei-fang! When everybody
goes out you stay here indoors all alone! Why don’t you go out
and have a good time?”

“T can’t—”

She stopped short and heaved a sigh, then squeezed Chang
Su-su’s hand as if to express what she had left unsaid.

Chang Su-su frowned and looked attentively at Huei-fang’s
face, but said nothing. Whatever they said, she could see no
signs of a “neurosis.” Why, then, should she shut herself up
in her room like this and refuse to come out? And why this
unconvincing attempt at being a nun or a Taoist or whatever
it was? The whole thing made Chang Su-su feel rather annoyed.
She suddenly recalled how, on the day of Old Mr. Wu's death,
she, Fan Po-wen, Wu Chih-sheng and the others had made bets
about Huei-fang; she said with a trace of sadness in her voice:

“Huei-fang, some time ago we made a bet about you—that’s
to say Wu Chih-sheng, Fan Po-wen and Pei-shan—oh, yes, and

Tu Hsin-to was there, too. The bet was about whether you
would change after you’d lived in Shanghai for a while. Though
none of us ever expected that you would change like this!”

“Did you expect me to change, then? Well, in what way did
you think I’d change, Su-su?”

“J don’t remember now, but whatever it was we all thought
you would change. But now—I don’t know—it seems so odd:
you’ve changed, and yet you haven’t, somehow!”

“Yes, I’ve noticed it myself. I’m not the same girl that I was
when I lived in the country!”

“Oh, but you are, Huei-fang! There was a time when you
seemed to be changing, but now you're back in the same old rut
again!”

Chang Su-su's voice was impatient as she said this. She was
now more convinced than ever that Huei-fang was far from
being neurotic and that Wu Sun-fu and the others were exag-
gerating.

“Back in the same old rut, did you say? But when I was
with father in the country I wasn’t the same as I am now. I
don't think anybody can understand why I’m so unhappy, Su-su!
And nobody wants to understand, either!”

Huei-fang’s voice was steady, and her eyes were suddenly
bright with determination. It was the first time Chang Su-su
had seen this steely glint in her eyes, and it rather surprised
her. But the next instant her eyes became dull and troubled
once again. She sat staring into space and muttered:

“So you bet on me, did you? And Fan Po-wen was in it, too.
What—what did he say about it? Do tell me, Su-su—oh, what's
the point? Forget it. Let’s talk about something else.”

Chang Su-su suddenly laughed, then jumped up, threw her
arm round Huei-fang’s neck and said excitedly in her ear:

“Why shouldn’t you ask me about Fan Po-wen? Why
shouldn’t we talk about him? I know all about it, Huei-fang;
I've known all along that you’ve got your eye cn him! But why
be so shy and backward about it? Sun-fu interferes, isn’t that
it? I’ve known all along about that, too. He’s got no right to
interfere in your private affairs! You're free to do what you
like!’

Huei-fang immediately crimsoned. Chang Su-su’s frank words
had struck home. She had brought into the open all the things
that had been preying on Huei-fang’s mind—all the things she
had not dared mention. She grasped Su-su’s hand and squeezed
it and tears of gratitude welled up in her eyes. But Chang Su-su
suddenly pulled her hand away and drew herself up, then fixed
her keen eyes on Huei-fang and said earnestly:

“I suppose all this shutting yourself in your room and chant-
ing from this Book of Rewards and Punishments here is your
way of protesting against Sun-fu’s dictatorship, then? You’re
going about it the wrong way! You've got the will to fight, all
right, but your method’s all wrong! And another thing: I must
warn you that Po-wen is a spineless young man who doesn’t dare
stand up for himself! He was in love with Pei-shan once, and
they used to spend all their time together; but the moment Sun-
fu objected, he backed out! I tell you, Huei-fang, if you’re going
to resist Sun-fu’s interference and fight for your freedom, it’s
no good pinning your hopes on a spineless weakling!”

As she said this, Chang Su-su laughed and brought both her
hands down sharply on Huei-fang’s shoulders. Huei-fang was
not expecting this and almost toppled off, but she had to laugh.
Then, as her smile faded, her expression became quite serious
again and she searched Chang Su-su’s face, She was trying to
pluck up courage to make further inquiries about the “spineless”
Fan Po-wen, but she was afraid her cousin might laugh at her
if she pursued the matter any further. She now looked up to
Su-su as her champion, and she did not want to appear too silly
in her champion’s eyes. After a great struggle, she finally de-
cided to try and tell Su-su what was on her mind.

“I think you understand what’s the matter with me, Su-su.
I’ve always been so used to hiding my feelings that I can’t bring
myself to be frank about them when I want to. I’ve no one to
confide in and no one to advise me! I just can’t think straight
and I don’t know what to do. I’m fed up with the miserable
life here and all I want to do is to go back home to the country.
When they refused to let me go, I made up my mind to shut
myself up in my room and have nothing more to do with them!
I’ve been here two days now, but I’m more miserable than

ever! I know I’m going about it the wrong way, Su-su, but
what is there I can do?”

Chang Su-su’s reply was a long, hilarious roar of laughter.
With a swing of her hips she moved up close to Huei-fang, held
her face between her hands, and looked at it closely. It was a
hot, flushed face with pale, trembling lips. After a moment
Chang Su-su said sternly, “It’s up to you, Huei-fang. You must
pluck up courage and have it out with Sun-fu once and for all!
Another thing: you ought to go to school. You must insist that
Sun-fu sends you to school next term!”

Huei-fang’s only reply was an emphatic shake of her head.
Chang Su-su’s eyes opened wide in astonishment and her fore-
head wrinkled.

“Don’t you want to go to school, then

“Yes, but I don't think any school would have me. I’ve read
shelves and shelves of ancient Chinese classics, but 1 don’t know
a thing about all these modern subjects.”

“That doesn’t matter: you can easily catch up on your own.
Now Huei-fang, the longer you stay cooped up in here the more
depressed you'll get! Come out for a walk with me!”

As she said this, Chang Su-su dragged her off the bed, then
told her to hurry up and have a wash and get herself ready
to go out. As she stood bathing her face over the wash basin,
Huei-fang smiled to herself and shed a few furtive tears. They
were tears of joy, and also tears of determination! Although
she had not yet any clear idea what exactly she was going to,
she was nevertheless determined to do whatever Chang Su-su
told her!

*

Chang Su-su had hired a car and was now taking Huei-fang
out for a breath of fresh air. It was past three o’clock and the
sun was at its hottest. Huei-fang sat back in the car with her
eyes closed, feeling slightly dizzy. Her mood of anxiety was
gradually returning again. Her future was, after all, still as
much a riddle as ever. She hoped this riddle would soon be
solved, but at the same time she was afraid. The car had left
the city and was now bumping over a none too smooth road on
the outskirts, churning up a swirl of hot, choking yellow dust
as it sped along. On either side of the road stretched vividly

green fields, dotted here and there with grave-mounds. Suddenly,
the car jolted violently and Huei-fang opened her eyes with a
start. When she saw they were in the country she thought that
she was dreaming again. She pulled herself together and nudged
Chang Su-su:

“Look! We’re going the wrong way, aren’t we?” ;

Chang Su-su smiled but made no reply, for she was at this
moment engrossed in her own day-dreaming. She was a sen-
sitive, warm-hearted girl, and it made her happy to think that
she had succeeded in luring Huei-fang out of her room. Just
now she was busying herself with plans for Huei-fang’s future,
a beautiful, exciting future as free as the sea and the sky, a
future with boundless possibilities.

Huei-fang took Chang Su-su’s silence as an assurance that
they had not lost their way and that they really were going
out into the country. She was glad. As she turned her whole
attention to enjoying the green fields which swirled past them
she could imagine for a moment that she was back home. In
fact, the only difference between this stretch of country place
and her own was the presence of the cars which raced past
them with their clouds of yellow dust. Suddenly, Huei-fang
gasped in amazement and nudged Chang Su-su once more. The
car was slowing down and ahead of them was a row of cars of
all shapes and colours parked in the shade of a grove of willow-
trees. Walking away from the cars were a number of women,
their heads on their escorts’ shoulders. Their lips were scarlet,
their eyebrows pencilled, and their arms white and bare. So
they were still in Shanghai!

As Huei-fang followed Chang Su-su out of the car and into a
strange-looking garden, her amazement gradually increased until
her head span. It was an ordinary country scene, with trees
and the churring of cicadas, but it was still obviously Shanghai
with its fashionably-dressed men and women behaving as always
in a way she was afraid to look at and yet which she envied.
Everywhere she turned she saw something which took her breath
away and made her blush uncomfortably. In the shade of a
nearby tree a man and a woman were lying on the grass, talk-
ing and laughing together, while one of the woman’s bare legs
was propped up high across the other, her high-heeled shoe point-

ing straight at the sky. A little farther away she saw a couple
so close together that they seemed to be one person with two
backs! Huei-fang quickly shut her eyes. Her heart was thump-
ing so hard that she could hardly bear it.

Then she caught sight of some familiar faces at a table beneath
a large sun-shade. There were three of them. She felt like
turning and running away, but Chang Su-su held her back.

“Well I'll be—look! The hermit’s left her cell! This deserves
to be writ large on the pages of history!”

This came from a young man under the sun-shade. As he
sprang to his feet he all but overturned the little table cluttered
up with beer bottles, lemonade bottles and plates of food. Huei-
fang blushed crimson, for the young man was none other than
Fan Po-wen. Suddenly her shameless dream came back to her
and her face changed from crimson to a deathly white. She
wanted to run away but her feet seemed rooted to the ground.
With a supreme effort she managed to turn and say hello to Wu
Chih-sheng.

“Tf jt’s such an historic event, Po-wen, you’d better write a
poem to commemorate it! The subject is—”

“But he can’t!” chaffed Wu Chih-sheng before Li Yu-ting could
set a subject. ‘Poverty may make other poets more imaginative,
but it leaves Po-wen without an idea in his head! How do you
imagine he could write poetry in his present state!”

But Fan Po-wen was unperturbed. He just shook his head
and said, “Can’t be helped! Even the Muse of Poetry has to
follow Mammon around! I’ve no choice in the matter!”

Everybody laughed and even Huei-fang joined in, though
Chang Su-su merely parted her lips in a mechanical smile, then
inquired with a puzzled frown, “What are you three doing con-
gregating here, anyway?”

“We might well ask you and Huei-fang the same thing!” parried
Wu Chih-sheng. He had spent a lot of time with Fan Po-wen just
lately, and was acquiring the poet’s fondness for repartee.

“Us? We've come out for a breath of fresh air. I’m taking
Huei-fang round to see what the modern youth of Shanghai gets
up to when it goes out into the country!”

“Well, as a matter of fact, we're here for much the same
reason. Professor Li here believes we’re in for an Armageddon

any moment now, and it’s ruined his appetite. He's afraid we'll
all be murdered in our beds before we know where we are. So
we've brought him along today to see how even these émigré
Russian aristocrats and bourgeois can still scrape a living!"

“I say, Chih-sheng!” protested Li Yu-ting hastily, scratching
his head without realizing that he was doing it. “You don’t
have to keep joking about serious matters!” Chang Su-su looked
on and listened, amused and annoyed at the same time. She
took hold of Huei-fang’s hand and was just going to walk away
when Fan Po-wen suddenly sprang up and exclaimed grimly:

“Did you hear that? Professor Li always takes everything
seriously and he’s always preparing for the worst. He’s got the
right idea! Just look at that White Russian émigré over there
—probably a marquis or an earl or something once! All his
life he’s had servants to bring him his wine and open his bottles
for him, but look at him now: it’s now his turn to wait on other
people! But he’s picked up his new trade pretty quickly—look,
he can even hold six lemonade bottles in one hand!”

“Ah, but when our turn comes, we probably won’t even have
the little luck that they’ve got!” said Li Yu-ting suddenly in
such a mournful voice that Wu Chih-sheng and the others burst
out laughing again.

“Just listen to the Three Wise Men! They bore me to tears!”
jeered Chang Su-su. She turned and left them, taking Huei-
fang with her. They went and sat at a little table under the
trees by the river and ordered lemonade. It was quiet here, and
they had a view of the river. The water sparkled in the blazing
sunlight, and there was not a boat in sight. Huei-fang felt
more at ease now, but one thing still puzzled her: why should
people come all the way here from the city just to drink lemonade
and talk and flirt? It wasn’t as if it was a beauty spot! Yet at
the same time she had to admit that the gaily-dressed people
who came here did help to liven the place up and give it a touch
of colour.

Chang Su-su appeared to be upset and sat in moody silence.
After a while she muttered to herself: “Decadent lot!— Still,
it’s not to be wondered at, really!”

She broke into a hysterical laugh and took a sip at her lem-
onade, then stretched and patted Huei-fang on the shoulder.

“What will you do if Sun-fu absolutely refuses to let you go
to school?”

“What would you suggest?”

“Take him to court!”

“What!” gasped Huei-fang, a flush of colour coming to her
cheeks. She stared dubiously at Chang Su-su as much as to
say, “You're joking!” Chang Su-su flashed her a look, then
tilted her head back and smiled. She had managed to instil a
little courage into the girl, and now her protégée was wavering
again. Huei-fang now went on:

“You're overdoing it, Su-su. It could never come to that! I
can always get Fu-fang to put in a word for me with Sun-fu.”

“Sg much the better—I was only suggesting legal action as
a last resort.”

“But Su-su, I don’t want to go back to that house again! I
couldn’t bear to live there another day!”

“Eh?—”

It was now Chang Su-su’s turn to be surprised. She just could
not keep pace with the devious workings of Huei-fang’s mird.
Huei-fang’s face was flushed again. She looked nervously all
round, then gazed appealingly at Chang Su-su. After a moment
her head drooped despairingly and she murmured, “You don’t
know how lonely I am in that house!”

“what do you mean, ‘lonely’?”

“They’ve all got friends but me! And I always feel so lost.
If I live there any longer I'll go mad!”

Chang Su-su burst out laughing. She had finally found out
why Huei-fang was so miserable. “Mostly sexual frustration!”
she thought to herself. She glanced at Huei-fang and laughed
again despite herself. It came as a disappointment to her to
realize that she had overestimated Huei-fang’s will to fight, yet
she could not help feeling sorry for her when she saw her miser-
able expression. She thought hard for a moment, unable to de-
cide what to do with this poor, inexperienced girl, but before she
made up her mind, Huei-fang said quite firmly, “I don’t want to
live in that house a day longer! Not a single day! I want to
live with you, Su-su, and have you teach me what to do!”

Being a warm-hearted girl, Chang Su-su could not find it in
her to disregard this desperate cry for help. Although she had a

“friend” herself, which would mean that Huei-fang would still
be as lonely as ever even if she came to live with her, Chang
Su-su had not the courage to explain this to Huei-fang and so
dash ali her hopes to the ground.

The sun had disappeared behind a cloud and a cool, refreshing
breeze had sprung up. Thinking that her main problem had now
been solved, Huei-fang began to dream of her free and happy
future. She did not really know much about Chang Su-su, ex-
cept that she was an undergraduate who was spending her sum-
mer vacation at a Y.W.C.A. hostel, yet she was prepared to adopt
this cousin of hers as a kind of foster-mother.

Suddenly, the sound of someone singing came across the water
on the wind. The accent was that of Huei-fang’s home town and
the voice seemed familiar to her. She smiled absently at Chang
Su-su. As the voice came nearer and nearer, Huei-fang began
to catch the words:

Heav’n and earth are a mighty forge
Where hidden forces flame,

And all things in the Universe
From Nature’s anvil came.

She recognized this as a verse from the ancient poem Ode to
the Roc and the voice as Tu Hsin-to’s. She could not help
laughing. She thought what a pleasant young man he was, and
her thoughts went immediately from him to Lin Pei-shan. By
now, Chang Su-su had also recognized the singer. She smiled,
then suddenly got up and crept down to the bank of the river,
where she crouched down under a tree. Huei-fang stopped laugh-
ing and followed Chang Su-su’s example.

A skiff came slowly round the bend, keeping close under the
nearer bank. Tu Hsin-to was rowing, and with him was a girl
in a brown straw hat with yellow ribbons that fluttered in the
breeze. Huei-fang recognized the hat—it was Lin Pei-shan’s.
The boat came nearer, and when it was about three or four yards
away Chang Su-su picked up a clod of carth and threw it at
the boat.

“Oh!”

It was Lin Pei-shan’s voice, all right! The hat moved round,
and the boat stopped at once. Then Chang Su-su sprang up and

laughed. “Having a good time, you selfish creatures? No won-
der some people are lonely!”

Tu Hsin-to and Lin Pei-shan turned round together and saw
Chang Su-su standing there, but Huei-fang had not yet shown
herself, There was more laughter as the oars splashed again and
the boat pulled in to the bank. As she crouched behind the tree,
Huei-fang heard the silvery voice of Lin Pei-shan:

“Su-su, you little revolutionary! I thought you were too busy
with ‘things that matter’ to come down here! We didn’t ask
you to join us because we were afraid of being called decadent
and corrupt!”

“But that was a beautiful bit of grenade-throwing, Miss Chang!
Qualified revolutionary!”

“Now guess who I've got here with me! If you guess wrong,
you'll have to give me Pei-shan as a forfeit!”

“Might be any old Tom, Dick or Harry!” taunted Lin Pei-shan.
Huei-fang began to feel rather shy of showing her face now. She
heard a rustle as the boat scraped up against the undergrowth
that overhung the water's edge, then, without warning, Chang
Su-su ran laughing round the tree and pulled her out of her
hiding-place so that the couple in the boat could see her. She
blushed awkwardly and said:

“Hullo, Pei-shan! I suppose you often come here? Though
the place doesn’t seem all that wonderful, really!”

“Why, Huei-fang! You're the last person I expected to find
here!—Congratulations, Su-su! The ruthless revolutionary at
work! Nobody else can talk her round, but you succeed in get-
ting her out to a place like this!”

The three girls now began talking and laughing all at the
same time. Tu Hsin-to anchored the boat by sticking an oar in
the mud and sat there in silence, a smile on his lips. So far as
he was concerned, all these ups and downs were just part of the
natural course of things and did not really interest him. When
Huei-fang had been unable to get what she wanted, she had
quite naturally taken refuge in her Book of Rewards and Pun-
ishments; it seemed to him just as natural that she should now
throw the book aside and come down to the gay Rio Rita Plea-
sure Garden.

Suddenly, there was a rumble of thunder and flying black
clouds began gathering overhead until the sky was blotted out.

“It’s going to rain!” said Chang Su-su, looking up at the sky.
She grasped Huei-fang’s arm. “We'd better be getting back,
Huei-fang.”

“Don’t worry! It'll only be a shower. Come on, come for a
row with us.”

“Not now. Though if you want to get a party together, Fan
Po-wen and the others are just over there! I'll run over and
fetch them if you like!”

With this parting shot at Lin Pei-shan, Chang Su-su went off
into a peal of laughter, then made off with Huei-fang.

Tu Hsin-to gazed after the two girls with his usual blasé smile
on his lips, then shoved off by pushing his oar against a tree-root
on the bank. As the boat swung slowly round, Lin Pei-shan’s
dress began flapping in the strong breeze that had sprung up.
She sat with bent head, watching the trees reflected in the water
and twisting the hem of her dress round her fingers. After a
while she looked up into Tu Hsin-to’s face with a look in her
eyes which seemed to say, “We can’t go on like this!’ But Tu
Hsin-to still smiled.

The boat was now passing through a sort of tunnel formed by
overhanging willows and reeds brushed rustling past its sides.
Lin Pei-shan sighed, then edged forward and pillowed her head
on Tu Hsin-to’s knees, He at once shipped his oars and let the
boat drift. Lin Pei-shan shifted her legs and laughed.

“The fact remains, you must find a way out!” she murmured
hesitantly. “... If only we could get Sun-fu to agree, every-
thing would be all right.” She fixed her limpid eyes on him for
a moment. “Oh, why don’t you say something? Didn’t you hear
what I said? I said all we want is to get Sun-fu to agree! We
must think of a way out—”

“IT know Sun-fu: he just won’t hear of it!’

“What are we going to do, then?”

“Oh, carry on as long as we can!”

“Hm! And how long will that be, pray?”

“Until we can’t go on any longer—until you've got a legal hus-
band!”

“Well! Of all the cheek!”

“Now look, Pei-shan, if you'll just think about it for a moment
you'll see that I’m right. You may as well ask for the moon as
expect Sun-fu to agree. Unless we elope, they’ll marry you off
sooner or later to somebody else. But you don’t want all the
hardship that would follow an elopement, and I’m not so keen
on the idea myself, either.”

“Well, that’s a fine thing to say! One would think there had
never been anything between us!”

“Oh, yes, we've had our moments! I’m not forgetting that.
But what of it? You’re still the same girl—you haven't lost any-
thing! Your lips are just as red, your arms are just as soft and
smooth, your eyes are just as eloquent as ever they were! Your
youth and beauty are intact. You'll make your future husband
happy, and you'll be happy yourself. Isn’t that right?”

Lin Pei-shan broke into a laugh. She could find nothing wrong
with what Tu Hsin-to had said, for she was still at an age where
her heart had not yet awoken to the meaning of true love. She
was still a child, and life for her was nothing more than one
long game. A trailing willow twig brushed against her face,
and she stretched out her hand and snapped it off. She put the
end in her mouth and bit off a shred, then spat it out and laughed.

“And who’s going to be my legal husband?”

“~ don’t know yet. Fan Po-wen, I shouldn’t wonder!”

“But they want me to marry off to your uncle Hsueh-shih!”

“Very poor taste! Hsueh-shih’s a first-class dolt. No good to
you for a husband! But never mind: life’s only a game!”

Lin Pei-shan laughed and scooped up a handful of water and
splashed it in Tu Hsin-to’s face with a look of pretended an-
noyance, but made no comment. The boat now came to the end
of the tunnel of willows and out into a narrower stretch of the
river. Tu Hsin-to laughed carelessly and took up the oars again.
With much splashing and gurgling the boat slowly turned round
again.

*

It was about five o’clock when the rain came, driving in from
the east. In Wu Sun-fu’s house the servants rushed to close all
the windows on the east side of the house, but they forgot about
Huei-fang’s room. Driven by the easterly gale, the rain pelted
into the room through the open window and drenched her precious

Book of Rewards and Punishments, which was lying open on a
table just inside, so that the vermilion lines between the columns
of characters in the text began to run and spread. The incense-
burner became full and the water overflowed and flooded the
table, reducing the expensive bundle of incense to a thin yellow
pulp, which gradually spread on to the book.

The rain sent everyone scurrying back home. Mrs. Wu was
the first one back. Feeling chilly in her damp clothes, she went
straight upstairs to change. Then Lin Pei-shan came in, alone.
Instead of going to change her wet clothes, she ran upstairs and
burst into Huei-fang’s room.

She stopped in surprise when she saw how the driving rain was
playing havoc with the room. She stood gaping for a moment,
then turned and ran along to her sister’s room. She shot in
through the door, then stood there laughing till her sides ached,
unable to get a word out.

Being quite accustomed to her sister’s foolish antics, Mrs. Wu
showed no signs of surprise, but continued to sit there holding
a cup of tea, lost in her own thoughts.

The room was gloomy and the rain was pelting noisily against
the window. They heard Wu Sun-fu’s car pull up outside the
front door. When she had recovered from her fit of laughing, Lin
Pei-shan went slowly across to Mrs. Wu and said in a low voice,
“Have you heard the news, Pei-yao? Do you know where Huei-
fang’s gone?”

Mrs. Wu Sun-fu seemed startled for a second, but immediately
smiled, thinking that her sister was playing a joke on her.

“l’ve just seen her—at the Rio Rita!”

Amused at the joke, Mrs. Wu burst out laughing. She gave
her sister a look and put down the cup.

“I’m not joking! It’s quite true! When it came on to rain
everyone left, but she’s not home yet! And her room’s flooded
out!”

Lin Pei-shan’s voice rose with excitement as she said this,
then she doubled up with laughter. Mrs. Wu frowned at her
sister’s hilarity, which she thought excessive, and was just going
to rebuke her when the door swung noisily open and Wu Sun-fu
stormed unceremoniously into the room.

“Pei-yao! How did Huei-fang manage to run away, without
your knowing?”

His wife realized from his furious voice and expression that
her sister had not been joking after all; but she resented his
attitude. She rose to her feet and retorted coldly, “She’s not a
prisoner, and I’m not a wardress. When she was moody the
other day, everybody was trying to get her to go out, and you even
accused me of not inviting her out often enough; but now that
she's gone down to the Rio Rita for the afternoon of her own
accord, you come along here shouting your head off and making
a terrible fuss about nothing!”

“Well, if you knew she was going out, why couldn’t you stop
her until I came home?”

“Well, if that isn’t the limit! How was I to know she wasn’t
allowed out? Anyway, I wasn’t here when she went out. The
first I knew about it was when Pei-shan told me she’d seen her
at the Rio Rita. Isn’t that right, Pei-shan?”

“Nonsense!’ Wu Sun-fu roared. “Nobody’s stopping her from
going out for a stroll! But this is different: she’s run away! Do
you hear? She’s run away! Look at this note!”

He tossed a ball of paper towards his wife. He threw it so
hard that it bounced off the table on to the floor. Mrs. Wu touched
it with the toe of her shoe but did not bend down and pick it up.
She suddenly looked worried as she remembered the strange way
Pei-shan had laughed a moment ago: she must have seen Huei-
fang with some man or other at the Rio Ritd! And now Huei-
fang had “run away”! All these thoughts came crowding on her
mind so quickly that she had no time to weigh them up properly.
Her eyes turned involuntarily to the floor again, seeking the ball
of paper, but Pei-shan had already picked it up and smoothed
it out. A mere three lines of elegant handwriting, unmistakably
Huei-fang’s.

“I suppose you'd already gone out when Su-su came, then?”
said Wu Sun-fu, his expression a little calmer now. “It strikes
me Su-su’s got a hand in this!”

Suddenly, his look of exasperation returned as he snatched the
note from his wife and read it carefully once more. Mrs. Wu
was more at ease now. She went and sat on a sofa and said

gently:

“I don’t think it’s so serious that we need fly into a passion
over it. Though Huei-fang does act rather strangely, I admit:
one moment she wants to shut herself up like a nun, the next,
she wants to go to school; and now she doesn’t even want to live
at home, but goes off to live in a Y.W.C.A. hostel of all places—”

“Yes, but if she wants to go to school, she’s only got to come
and tell me. I'd be the last to refuse! There’s no need for her
to scribble me a note and slip away as if she were eloping! And
if she wants to catch up on her studies before going to school,
what's wrong with doing it here? If she wants a tutor, I can
easily get her one. But no: she wants Su-su to coach her—as if
Su-su could!”

“Why not leave her to it?” Mrs. Wu suggested in a persuasive
tone of voice now that her husband’s rage seemed to have died
dowh. “In a few days she’ll have had enough and then she'll
come running back!” Lin Pei-shan now put in, “When I saw
Su-su and Huei-fang at the Rio Rita, Huei-fang seemed her usual
self and didn’t say much. And Su-su didn’t mention this business,
either. I expect they got talking afterwards and decided to do it
on the spur of the moment. I always thought Huei-fang was
rather stubborn, but I realize now that she’s quite easily led!”

Wu Sun-fu nodded and relapsed into silence. He now began
pacing up and down with his hands clasped behind his back, as
if he was still worried about it all and trying to think of a solu-
tion. Though he was beginning to realize what was behind his
sister’s recalcitrance, it was still a challenge to his authority, and
as such he obviously could not afford to ignore it. To make things
worse, Pei-shan’s suggestion that Huei-fang was “easily led” had
provided him with another headache. He was well aware that
Chang Su-su was scatter-brained, meddlesome, and not over-
particular in her choice of friends, and the prospect of his “easily
led” sister going to live with her annoyed him. It was unthink-
able that he, her elder brother, should stand aside and not inter-
vene!

He suddenly stopped and turned to look at his wife. His face
looked gloomier than ever in the half-light, and his eyes glinted
angrily. He took a pace towards his wife as if to pounce on her,
and she, not knowing what storm was now to burst about her
ears, felt her heart miss a beat and a cold shudder trickle down

her spine. Fortunately for her, there was now an interruption—
Wang Mah came in to announce a visitor. Wu Sun-fu rolled his
eyes, then turned and began to go out. As he got to the door
he stopped and turned to his wife again:

“Pej-yao! Go straight down to this Y.W.C.A. hostel and fetch
Huei-fang home! Whatever happens, I insist that she comes
home!”

“What's the hurry? Huei-fang’s stubborn, and you can’t expect
her to come back home the very same day that she runs away.”

Mrs. Wu’s reply had been as tactful as she could make it, but
it only made her husband all the more infuriated.

“Don’t argue!” he roared. “Get down there straight away!
Whatever happens, we must get her back here today! If we
don’t do it today she'll never come back!”

With this order, and without any explanation of what exactly
he meant, Wu Sun-fu hurried downstairs to see his visitor.

The visitor was Wang Ho-fu. He had become impatient wait-
ing for Wu Sun-fu, and when he saw him coming at last he
grasped him agitatedly by the sleeve and led him into the small
drawing-room. He slammed the door behind him and, without
even a word of greeting, plunged straight into his business in a
furtive whisper:

“Something urgent! Just had a report from Hsu Man-li! She
says Chao Po-tao knows we're selling short and that he’s going
to do his damnedest to put a spoke in our wheel, the rat! He’s
going to fight it out with us! Though, according to her, Chao
Po-tao hasn’t got much to play with, himself!”

Not until Wang Ho-fu had finished did Wu Sun-fu breathe
again. He was somewhat relieved to learn that there had not
been a real disaster as he had for the moment feared. So Chao
Po-tao was up to his tricks again, eh? Well, it wouldn't be the
first time, and Wu Sun-fu had no particular reason to worry on
that score. If Chao Po-tao was now feeling the pinch himself,
it was no more than he deserved! That's what comes of trying
to put a spoke in the other chap’s wheel all the time!... As these
thoughts went through his head, Wu Sun-fu even began to feel
exultant again, and a smile came to his lips.

“It was only to be expected that Chao Po-tao should go all-out
to stop us. Just think, Ho-fu: didn’t we do our best to put his

back up when we sold the eight factories? We pretended to do
business with him, even after we had already negotiated a sale
with the foreign firm and the Japanese company! The result
was that he lost his broker's commission and in all probability
got a rap on the knuckles from his boss! It was really brilliant
the way Chi-jen pulled it off! Yes, we made a good job of show-
ing Chao Po-tao up in his true colours to his boss. No wonder
he’s nettled with us!—Though I don’t quite see, Ho-fu, why he
should be feeling the pinch.”

“Wait a minute. I'll tell you about his latest trick first. He's
organizing some sort of ‘Committee for the Maintenance of Gov-
ernment Bonds,’ and in their name he’s going to wire a petition
to the government to stop the practice of selling short! Our
lawyer friend Chiu Chun has also found out from another source
that they’re also going to petition the Ministry of Finance to order
the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communica-
tions, and some other note-issuing banks to accept all types of
government bonds as pledges or discount them, and at the same
time to order the Stock Exchange to make it obligatory for
sellers to hand in actual bonds as security before making any
sale. This would mean the end of all speculative selling by
bears—”

“But it’s utterly impossible!” interrupted Wu Sun-fu, still smil-
ing calmly. “It would be tantamount to suspending the busi-
ness of the Stock Exchange! No, Ho-fu, I think this is just another
rumour put round by Chao Po-tao to encourage the bulls!”

But Wang Ho-fu was not to be gainsaid. Perhaps because he
had talked himself into a state of excitement, perhaps because
he was over-anxious—whatever the reason, he was perspiring
profusely. He stared round-eyed at Wu Sun-fu as the latter
spoke, then said in a loud voice:

“Not a bit of it!—Now, you may think all that’s enough to be
going on with, but there’s more to come! He's also using his in-
fluence to get the Board of Directors of the Stock Exchange and
the Brokers’ Association to issue immediately a new set of reg-
ulations which will increase the seller’s security to twice the
Present amount! And that, Sun-fu, is quite possible!”

“What!—You mean that? And what about the buyer’s de-
posit? No increase, I suppose!”

Wu Sun-fu sprang to his feet, the colour draining from his
cheeks. He realized he had underestimated his enemy.

“Of course I mean it. I got it from Han Meng-hsiang. And
Lu Kuang-shih says it’s all been fixed up and that it'll be an-
nounced tomorrow!”

“But it’s illegal!’ protested Wu Sun-fu, shaking his head.
“There’re two sides to every transaction—you must have a buyer
and a seller, and you can’t make fish of one and fowl of the
other! It would be illegal!”

The veins stood out blue on his temples, but curiously enough
there was no sweat on his forehead. Wang Ho-fu slapped his
thigh and sighed.

“you can eall it illegal if you like, but there it is! I tell you,
Sun-fu, Chao Po-tao’s making a hullabaloo all round about ‘pre-
serving the integrity of government bonds and steadying the
market,’ and putting it round that the bears are a menace to the
money market and a dangerous nuisance in the Stock Exchange.
He browbeats the Board of Directors of the Stock Exchange with
this impressive blether, and they just have to give in to him!”

“It’s a blatant stab in the back for the bears!” muttered Wu
Sun-fu through clenched teeth. “It’s scandalous!”

He was now even more apprehensive than Wang Ho-fu had
been a moment ago. For a while the two men sat silent and
frowning, staring at one another. A motorcar horn sounded just
outside, then again at the gate. “That must be Pei-yao going
out to fetch Huei-fang home,” thought Wu Sun-fu. “Though why
couldn’t she leave a bit sooner?” His thoughts wandered to Tu
Chu-chai. This brother-in-law of his was a bit of a coward...
would he dare sell in the circumstances? Wu Sun-fu was far
from sure, and his heart sank. At length, Wang Ho-fu spoke
again:

“Pye been talking it over with Chi-jen, and he thinks roughly
the same as you. He agrees it’s impossible to demand that the
actual bonds be deposited before selling them, but he’s certain
that the doubling of the cash deposit for the seller will come
off! In which case, every five thousand dollars of Chao Po-tao’s
money will be equal to ten thousand of ours! This means that
he can jump in just before the settlement and turn the table on
us just like that! We don’t stand a chance!”

“In that case I suppose we’d better cover as fast as we can.
When Chao Po-tao has completed his arrangements the prices
will be pushed up!”

“But Chi-jen has a different idea, He’s afraid that if we cover
now, itll mean that all our work will have been wasted. He’s
for fighting to the last ditch! The military situation being what
it is, the prices can’t very well go up all that much. He thinks
we should take a chance—nothing venture, nothing gain! He
says that if we do go down he’ll look at it as if one of his boats
had been sunk—he’d pretend his two hundred thousand dollars
had gone to the bottom of the river and he'd take it quite calmly!
—You know, I think Chi-jen’s got something there!”

Wang Ho-fu’s voice was quite firm as he said this, and his
big, round eyes were fixed intently on Wu Sun-fu. Two months
before a vigorous, stubborn statement like this could have come
only from Wu Sun-fu, but Wu Sun-fu was no longer the man
he had been, and his mind now tended towards caution and com-
promise. Now, even with Wang Ho-fu goading him on, he was
wavering and hesitant. He frowned dubiously.

“But how can we fight to the last ditch?” he asked. “The five
hundred thousand dollars we got for the factories is all tied up
in bonds, and I have about two hundred thousand more locked
up in cocoons and unsold silk. We're stumped without ready
cash!”

“Ah, I’ve already discussed that with Chi-jen. This is how
we get round it: we three shall find another five hundred thou-
sand dollars between us, and at the same time you do everything
you can to get Tu Chu-chai to sell short again. The two things
combined should see us safely through the crisis!”

“We can’t rely on Tu Chu-chai, though. The other day when
he agreed to sell short, he actually sold as many as three million,
but I found out the day before yesterday that he’s already
covered — covered as soon as he could make a paltry profit of
twenty dollars for every ten thousand! And he only made that
profit because we’d sold two million! Now I ask you, Ho-fu,
what’s the use of a coward like that to us? When we got him
to go in with us it was on the understanding that we sink or swim

together, but now it turns out that he was only out to sponge
on us! What can you do with a man like that?”

“T still think you ought to have another go at him, Sun-fu.
The settlement’s so close that, even if Chu-chai won't sell short,
it would be a great help to us if he would agree to remain neutral
by not turning bull, either!”

As he said this, Wang Ho-fu chuckled and stroked his beard
as if he was quite sure that they would win in the end, and Wu
Sun-fu could not very well refuse to try Tu Chu-chai again. They
now began to discuss how the three of them could raise the five
hundred thousand dollars which they would need. Wang Ho-fu
spoke unhurriedly, ticking the sums of money off on his fingers:

“The new cash deposits in our company amount to about two
hundred thousand dollars, which leaves three hundred thousand
to be found. The three of us should be able to manage a hun-
dred thousand each. And if Tang Yun-shan has had any luck
finding new shareholders in Hongkong, and if he can wire us
two or three hundred thousand in the next five or six days, we'll
be sitting pretty!—Besides, I got a tip from Huang Fen today
that the military situation is turning in favour of the bears. So,
all things considered, we now have a better opportunity than
we'll ever have and we mustn't let it slip through our fingers!
—I don’t know what's the matter with you lately, Sun-fu: you
seem to have lost all your strength of will!”

Wu Sun-fu sat in silence for a while, then a flush of excite-
ment crept into his face and his eyes gleamed. He brought his
hand down with a thump on the arm of his chair and growled,
“That's it, then! Since you and Chi-jen are so keen on the idea,
I'm with you! But to tell the truth I’m right out of ready cash.
What I'll do is to mortgage my own factory! And my house
and its grounds are worth well over a hundred thousand. Yes,
I think I could raise a couple of hundred thousand on the fac-
tory and the house together!”

Wang Ho-fu laughed with elation and gave Wu Sun-fu the
“thumbs up” sign. Wu Sun-fu now went on: “There’s only one
thing, Ho-fu: 1 think I can mortgage the house all right by
myself, but I'll have to have Chi-jen’s help to find someone for
the factory.”

“Tha?ll be all right! I'l] tell Chi-jen to come round and see
you. That's settled, then; and you'll be doing your best to talk
Chu-chai round!”

Wang Ho-fu was in the best of spirits as he stood up and took
his leave. Just as he was getting into his car he turned round
to Wu Sun-fu again and said, “Oh, and another thing, Sun-fu: I
hear this woman Liu Yu-ying isn’t very reliable. She’s running
with the hare and hunting with the hounds!”

“Aha, so she’s spying for Chao Po-tao as well, is she?—How
do you know?”

“Han Meng-hsiang told me. And Hsu Man-li warned me
about her, too. Colonel Lei told her.”

“I'll be on my guard against her, then.—So she’s hooked Colonel
Lei as well, has she?”

He nodded thoughtfully. Wang Ho-fu laughed, then got into
the car and drove off.

The rain had gone over by now, and the sky was bright again,
streaked with yellow clouds like a vast tiger-skin. Wu Sun-fu
remained standing on the front steps, lost in thought. He was
thinking of the coming “fight to the last ditch” in the Exchange
and of the mortgaging of his factory and house. His thoughts
came thick and fast, but he felt sluggish and dispirited. He stood
there a long time, until he was startled out of his reverie by
the arrival of the car with his wife. He remembered he still
had to go and see Tu Chu-chai on his “diplomatic mission.”

“Huei-fang utterly refuses to come home!” gasped Mrs. Wu as
she got out of the car. “But the hostel looked a quiet and re-
spectable enough place to me, so I think we might let her stay
on there a few days and see what happens.”

She fully expected another outburst from Wu Sun-fu, but to
her relief he just nodded. Then he shepherded her back into the
car and told the chauffeur:

“Mr. Tu’s!— Got it? Mr. Tu’s place!”

As she sat beside her husband, Mrs. Wu could not help smil-
ing. She had not the slightest inkling that Sun-fu was going to
see Tu Chu-chai on business, but naturally assumed that he
was going to pick up his sister Fu-fang and take her with him
to help persuade Huei-fang to come home. She could not help

thinking that he was making mountains out of molehills. In
any case, she was beginning to sympathize with Huei-fang, for
even she had often thought what a dreary, depressing place the
house was. As these thoughts passed through her mind, her
smile vanished and gave way to a look of melancholy resigna-
tion. Suddenly, she felt her husband’s hand close round hers.
She smiled, stiffly.

As the clock struck nine and the clear, measured strokes on the
vibrating metal coil twanged in the ears of Wu Sun-fu, who was
still asleep in the inner room, his eyelids seemed to flutter, but his
mind was still submerged in the heavy black waters of a dream.
He had heard the clear, vibrant strokes of the clock in his dream,
but for him this sound was the urgent voice of the gong on the
platform of the Exchange, the signal for the opening of another
session and the signal for the beginning of a fight to the death
for himself and his partners.

It was these gong-strokes in the dream that had made his
eyelids flutter. The settlement was only three days off, and in
the last few days Wu Sun-fu and his partners had thrown the
last reinforcements they had been able to muster into the front
line and waged a fierce offensive along the whole front, but
nothing they could do seemed of any avail in dislodging the bulls
from their position. Their only hope now was that Tu Chu-chai
would rush in to their rescue. The night before, Wu Sun-fu had
worked until the small hours trying to persuade Tu Chu-chai to
come in with them. And this had been the fourth time he had
tried! Tu Chu-chai had not yet refused outright, so they still
had a glimmer of hope—though they realized that whatever hap-
pened they were still not out of the wood!

A despairing laugh came from the sleeping Wu Sun-fu, then
his brows were drawn tightly together and he clenched his teeth
and shuddered violently. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, blood-
shot eyes that stared fixedly as if in a trance, and tiny beads of
sweat began breaking out on his forehead as he remembered the
horror of his dream. A pale yellow sunlight threw shadows on
the curtains and a faint breeze brought the hum of traffic from
the distant street.

“Thank Heaven it was only a dream!” he thought, as he scram-
pled quickly out of bed. He had a wash, only to find Chao Po-
tao’s face grinning at him from the water in the wash-basin—
jt was the face that had haunted his dreams with its evil, gloat-
ing smile! As he was going past his dressing-mirror, he auto-
matically glanced at it and saw his own face——a face stamped
deep with the lines of defeat and despair. Down in the drawing-
room and the dining-room, the servants were bustling round
changing loose covers and taking the carpets up for beating. The
moment his eye fell on this scene of activity, he remembered
that the house was mortgaged and that if he could not pay back
the loan in time his creditors would foreclose, and then there
would be all the bustle and commotion of moving out.

It seemed to him that the house was full of leering eyes
giorying in his misfortune. He felt that sitting here in the “rear”
waiting for news was ten, twenty times more painful than going
up to the “front” himself. Little caring that he had made an
appointment with Sun Chi-jen for ten o’clock, he hurried straight
out to the car and drove off.

Although the car was speeding along a fairly unfrequented road
at the record speed for 1930, Wu Sun-fu felt that even the car
was trying to thwart him by refusing to go faster. He suddenly
discovered that, without his noticing it, even the dismal pale
sunlight had disappeared, and that they were driving through a
fine drizzle which looked more like a thick mist. There was
something strangely familiar about his gloomy surroundings—
as well there might be! For it was on just such a morning as
this—a morning of misty drizzle when everything became blurred
in outline and acquired an air of grandeur—that he had once
before sat in his car plunging headlong in just the same way into
an unknown, misty future. Suddenly, it all came back to him:
two months before, when he had been co-operating with Chao
Po-tao as a bull, the morning of their “decisive battle” had been
just such a gloomy, wet morning as this! Nevertheless, though
the scene was the same, their roles had now been drastically
changed: he and Chao Po-tao were now at daggers drawn! To
make things worse, an inscrutable Tu Chu-chai held their fates
in the balance!

As he sat there in the car, Wu Sun-fu smiled grimly to himself:
What point was there in going down to the Exchange at all? The
really decisive days had been the last three, and they had gona,
Everything humanly possible had been done and their last penny
had already been thrown into the struggle: What difference could
he or anyone make to the fortunes of battle at this late hour?
Yes, today would be the final skirmish, as when a commander-
in-chief sends even his own bodyguard to the front line in a last
desperate offensive. But surely it would be enough to leave the
execution of his orders to his front-line commander without go-
ing up to the front himself? Wu Sun-fu frowned and smiled
wryly to himself as he decided to go back home and wait for
news there; yet he could not bring himself to tell his chauffeur
to turn back. He had now lost even the small amount of will-
power needed to do this! No matter how anxiously he urged
himself to ‘Keep calm! Even if you lose, you must keep calm!”
he still found it impossible to repress his excitement,

He was still in this state of anxiety and doubt when the car
drew up outside the Exchange. He threaded his way in through
the main entrance as if in a dream and went straight over to the
notice-board to find the number of his broker, Lu Kuang-shih.
Trading had apparently not yet begun, yet the Exchange rang with
the deafening din of voices. But Wu Sun-fu appeared to be blind
and deaf to all this: all he saw was a vision of Chao Po-tao’s face,
which seemed to fill all the space.

Lu Kuang-shih’s cubicle, which was not much bigger than a
sentry-box, was completely occupied by a corpulent gentleman
—it was, as a matter of fact, Wang Ho-fu—who was using the
telephone. The broker himself stood outside talking with a floor-
man. Wu Sun-fu’s arrival attracted no attention until he stopped
in front of the cubicle, when Lu Kuang-shih suddenly turned
round to find him standing there. Just at that moment Wang
Ho-fu hung up the receiver,

“Ah! Sun-fu! Here you are! I’ve just been trying to get you
on the phone!”

As Wang Ho-fu sprang up to greet him, he grasped Wu Sun-
fu by the sleeve and pulled him into the cubicle, where he wedged
him in the corner beside the telephone, as if he was afraid to ex-
pose his friend to public view. The latter smiled cheerlessly and

would have spoken had he not been too agitated to find some-
thing to say. As it was, Wang Ho-fu immediately bent over and
asked in a whisper:

“You haven't seen Sun Chi-jen yet, have you? Oh, well, he’
be here in a moment. What about Tu Chu-chai? Has he made
up his mind yet?”

“Not quite. Though I don’t think he’ll put much on the
market, in any case. Not more than a million, anyway.”

The moment Wu Sun-fu had opened his mouth and said some-
thing, his optimism had begun to return and he now felt some-
what calmer. Wang Ho-fu stroked his beard and smiled.

“you think he'd sell a million? That would be splendid! The
thing is, Sun-fu, we're left high and dry today! The mortgaging
of your factory didn’t come off. Chi-jen and I have tried every-
body we can think of, but we’ve had no luck at all. All we can
do today is to—”

“ts to what? Don’t tell me we haven't even got the hundred
thousand dollars left that we agreed on the day before yesterday!”

“No, it’s all right! Though it’s all we’ve got in reserve for
today.”

“Right, then, get rid of the lot the moment they open! Agreed?
Have you told Han Meng-hsiang what we're doing yet?”

“Don't let me hear you mention Han Meng-hsiang’s name
again! I found out only last night that even he isn’t reliable!
Every time we've sold short we’ve done it through him for
secrecy’s sake, and—would you believe it?—he’s now gone and
given the show away to Chao Po-tao! It’s the worst thing that
could have happened!”

As Wang Ho-fu said this, he dropped his voice until it was
scarcely audible. Wu Sun-fu did not catch every word, but he
understood perfectly. His face suddenly paled, his ears buzzed,
and black spots danced madly before his eyes. Another of his
subordinates had sold the pass! This was the unkindest cut of
all! After a moment, Wu Sun-fu finally managed to mutter
through clenched teeth: “You can’t trust anybody!—Well, Ho-fu,
I suppose we’ll have to go through Lu Kuang-shih today?”

“No! I've found another broker and everything’s already fixed
up. The moment they open, we sell!”

Hardly were the words out of his mouth when the gong sounded
for the opening. Immediately, a thunderous uproar arose as trad-
ing began, until the building seemed to shake. Wang Ho-fu ran
out, but Wu Sun-fu remained sitting where he was, unable to
move. His legs no longer obeyed him, the buzzing in his ears
came back again, and the black spots once more danced before
his eyes. He had never felt as weak as this before~it was
fantastic!

Suddenly, Wang Ho-fu ran back, panting and dejected; he
wrung his hands as he gasped, “Opened with a rise! Up fifty
cents!”

“What!-—Sell out quick!” raved Wu Sun-fu, springing to his
feet. “Get rid of the whole hundred thousand in reserve!”

Suddenly, Wu Sun-fu’s head swam and he had a feeling of
nausea in the pit of his stomach. His legs gave way under him
and he collapsed, his eyes staring and his face deathly pale. Wang
Ho-fu was so startled that he felt suddenly cold, but quickly step-
ped forward; he pinched Wu Sun-fu’s upper lip with one hand
and held him by the hair with the other. For a moment there
was no one on hand to help; then, as luck would have it, Sun
Chi-jen arrived. Cool and resourceful, he snatched up a glass
of cold water, took a mouthful of it, and spurted it in Wu Sun-
fu’s face. The glazed eyes stirred, and Wu Sun-fu brought up
a gobbet of phlegm.

“Sell out quick—” he repeated, his eyes Staring wildly. Sun
Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu exchanged glances, then Sun Chi-jen
patted Wu Sun-fu on the shoulder and said, “Don’t worry, Sun-
fu! Ho-fu and I are here to take care of everything. You'd bet-
ter go home and take it easy. It’s suffocating in here and you'll
only be worse if you stay!”

“It’s nothing!” said Wu Sun-fu, springing to his feet. “It was
just a touch of phlegm, and I’m all right now.—But tell me, have
you sold them yet?”

His face was a better colour now, and life was returning to
his eyes, though his forehead was as red as fire. Sun Chi-jen
noticed it and recognized it as a serious sign. Between them,
Sun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu forcibly dragged Wu Sun-fu out
of the Exchange in spite of all his protests and bundled him into
his car. Meanwhile the Exchange resounded with the fiercest

duel between the bulls and the bears that it had ever known. Wu
Sun-fu’s partners fired their last shot—they threw one and a half
million Disbandment on the market, and the quotations began to
drop steadily!

If Wu Sun-fu’s supposed ally Tu Chu-chai had now come on
the scene and thrown himself into the fray with them, victory
would have been assured for the bears. As it happened, Tu
Chu-chai’s car pulled up in front of the Exchange just as Wu
Sun-fu’s was moving off. The two chauffeurs honked a greeting
at each other in passing, but neither’s employer noticed what was
happening. At the moment when Tu Chu-chai’s car grated to a
stop, Wu Sun-fu’s was already speeding homewards.

*

It may have been the noise and lack of fresh air on the floor
of the Exchange that had brought on Wu Sun-fu’s attack of gid-
diness, for he felt much better as soon as the car started up.
The hectic flush on his temples was gradually fading, and he
could think “soberly” once again, though this “sober” thinking
brought some of the pallor back to his cheeks and made his heart
seem like a heavy weight in his chest, so that he had difficulty
in breathing.

The drizzle had now become a downpour, and the wind had
an edge to it. When Wu Sun-fu arrived home and got out of the
car, he shivered and went goosefiesh all over. Ah-hsuan and
Pei-shan were laughing and shouting noisily in the drawing-
room, and just as Wu Sun-fu was going past the door, Ah-hsuan
dashed out with a book in his hand, pursued by Pei-shan. Wu
Sun-fu frowned, but walked on without another look at them.
Just lately he had ‘ceased to bother himself with such minor
“breaches of the peace.” Besides, Huei-fang’s recalcitrance seemed
to have struck a blow at his authority in his own household, for
Ah-hsuan, for one, was becoming rowdier than he had ever been
before.

As soon as he was seated in his study, Wu Sun-fu sent for the
butler. His first order was “Send for Dr. Ting”; his second was
“Tm not at home to visitors”; his third—he broke off as he sud-
denly caught sight of a telegram on the desk. He waved the
butler away and tore open the envelope.

The telegram was from Tang Yun-shan in Hongkong and con-
tained forty or so words in code. By the time he had decoded
seven or eight words, he had completely forgotten about the
third that he had been going to give. Suddenly, he remembered
there was something else he was going to do. He laid the tele-
gram aside and picked up the telephone. After a moment’s
hesitation he rang Tu Chu-chai’s home number. When he heard
where Tu Chu-chai had gone, he smiled. The last dying glimmer
of hope in his mind now revived and became stronger and
stronger.

What raised his hopes higher than ever was the discovery that
Tang Yun-shan’s telegram was full of good news: apparently,
Tang Yun-shan was getting results in Hongkong, and the mili-
tary situation was turning in their favour; he had made a number
of extremely valuable business contacts in Hongkong, and with
their assistance the Yi Chung Company could be put on its feet
again; and, finally, he was coming back to Shanghai immediately.

Wu Sun-fu was unable to repress a sudden burst of laughter.
Heaven helps them who help themselves, and no mistake about
it!

Yet almost immediately his elation began to fade. A faint
smile still hovered on his lips, but it was a wry one. What if
all this talk about “extremely valuable business contacts in
Hongkong” were just another of Tang Yun-shan’s castles in the
air? It wouldn’t be the first time he’d been caught that way!
In any case, even if there was anything in what he said, “You
won’t put out a fire with water a league away!” The outcome
of the struggle would be decided by the next day at the very
latest, and all Wu Sun-fu and his partners were interested in now
was immediate help, for only immediate help could save them!

Even if Tang Yun-shan had struck lucky this time, Wu Sun-fu
was still displeased with the man’s muddle-headedness. Hadn't
he sent him telegram after telegram urging him to wire any
money back the moment he laid hands on it? And still all he
got was promises! And what did he mean by “coming back to
Shanghai immediately”? Anyone would think Hongkong was
still living in the eighteenth century and using bulky silver ingots
which Tang Yun-shan could only bring back to Shanghai in per-

son! Here was he crying out for money which Tang Yun-shan
was blithely carrying round in his pocket!

As he thought this, even the faint, wry smile vanished from
his face. To meet with disappointment after having one’s hopes
raised was more painful than never having one’s hopes raised at
allt At first, when he had just decoded the telegram, he had
thought of ringing up Sun Chi-jen and Wang Ho-fu to tell them
the good news, but now it was more than he dared do. As he
sat there with his head in his hands, he felt as if his head was
on fire. He stood up and began pacing to and fro, but he shivered
at every step, and he felt as if cold water were trickling down his
spine. He sat down again, but immediately stood up once more,
only to sit down a second time. One moment he felt as if he
was in a furnace; the next, as if he had been plunged into an
ice-house!

He was at last forced to admit to himself that he was ill. Yes,
ever since the go-slow in the factory he had been troubled by this
strange malady, and just lately the attacks had become more
frequent. And now it had come to this—being overcome with
dizziness in the Exchange! It looked suspiciously like the first
stages of congestion of the brain—the illness his father had died
oft “What's happened to the doctor? Blast him! Just when
I need him urgently, he lets me down!"—He was so eager to gel
someone to vent his anger on!

Suddenly, the telephone rang, and its jangle seemed to hold
a note of urgency.

Wu Sun-fu went suddenly tense all over. He was certain it
was a call from Sun Chi-jen on the Exchange floor. His hand
trembled as he picked up the receiver. He gritted his teeth for
a weak “Hullo?” then held his breath as he listened to what
Sun Chi-jen had to report about their desperate struggle His
eyebrows suddenly shot up and his eyes gleamed excitedly and
finally he even smiled.

“Oh!... Up and then down again, eh?... What! Dropped to
thirty-three dollars? ... Whew!... What a pity!... Well, it looks
as if the bulls are losing their appetite at last!... What did you
say? ‘Reorganization’ is opening now?... What?... Selling an-
other two million?... The deposit on credit?... By all means!...
I just got a telegram from Tang Yun-shan—says he’s struck lucky

in Hongkong.... Yes, we may as well go the whole hog!... No,
he hasn’t sent the money yet, but I think it’s ali right to go ahead
just the same!... Oh, so Chao Po-tao’s risking all he's got, as
well!—Makes us quits!... It shows what a rat Han Meng-hsiang
is! If he hadn’t gone over to the other side, Chao Po-tao would
have given up yesterday!... You bet! We'll teach the little rat
a lesson he won't forget in a hurry!... Chu-chai? He's already
down there at the Exchange!... Haven’t seen him yet? Well, have
a look round.... Oh!...”

As Wu Sun-fu hung up, his features darkened again. This time
he was not so much worried as angry. So Han Meng-hsiang had
let him down, the scoundrel! And Liu Yu-ying, too! Lining her
pockets from both sides, the bitch! It had always been the same:
all his great schemes had been wrecked by subordinates with
neither conscience nor loyalty! It put one’s teeth on edge to
think about them! He had always played fair and never let
anyone down, but his kindness was always repaid with ungrate-
ful treachery! Apart from those two wretches Han Meng-hsiang
and Liu Yu-ying, even his own sister had turned on him, and
had now run away from home as if he were a cruel monster!

A wave of anger swept over him, and he trembled from head
to foot. His face pale with rage and his teeth clenched, he began
pacing swiftly up and down. These last few days his prestige
had been trampled in the mud! He must do something about
it! As soon as the present crisis on the Exchange was over, he
must firmly re-establish his waning authority! Both in public
and in his own home he must again set himself up as the in-
carnation of authority! As he paced to and fro, he began plan-
ning all that he would be and do, once he had won this present
battle on the Exchange!

Suddenly the telephone rang again with that same note of
urgency.

This time he was not so nervous as he had been the time be-
fore, for he had already been fortified by the good news so far.
As he picked up the receiver his hand was steady and deft. As
a voice spoke at the other end of the line, he cried:

“That you, Ho-fu?... What is it?... Never mind that! Tell me
what's happening!”

A sudden blast of wind swept through the garden and howled
in the trees. As he listened, Wu Sun-fu’s face suddenly paled.

“What!” he gasped. “Up again?... Somebody buying in while
we're holding the price down?... Eh? Not Chao Po-tao? A new
bull? Who? Who?... What! Chu-chai?... Well, Pll be damned!...
We're sunk, then! Finished!...”

Crash! The receiver fell on to the desk as Wu Sun-fu staggered
back and collapsed on a sofa, where he sat wide-eyed and panting.
Even his own brother-in-law Chu-chai had stabbed him in the
back. It was only the night before that he had been perfectly
frank with Tu Chu-chai and told him exactly what the situation
on the stock market was and what his own plans were—and
all the time he had been playing into the hands of a traitor!—
“Every man’s hand against me and even my own relatives be-
traying me! What have I done—what have I done to deserve
it?” As this one thought hammered at his tortured mind, he
suddenly sprang up with a wild laugh and pounced forward; he
wrenched open a drawer of his desk, snatched out a revolver,
and turned the muzzle towards his heart. His face was purple,
and his eyes glared as if they would burst from their sockets.

Outside, the gale howled and drove the rain against the window
in a crackling fury. The gun had not been fired. Wu Sun-fu
drew a long sigh and collapsed on to the swivel-chair. The re-
volver fell to the floor. Just then Li Kuei, one of the servants,
came in with Dr. Ting.

Wu Sun-fu leapt to his feet and smiled wryly at the doctor.
“Sorry to trouble you: there might have been a little accident
just now, but it’s all right now.—Though now that you’ve come
perhaps you'd like to take a seat.”

Dr. Ting shrugged his shoulders in wonder, but before he could
say anything, Wu Sun-fu had turned and snatched up the re-
ceiver again. This time he was ringing the factory. Having
checked that it was Tu Wei-yueh on the other end, he shouted
one peremptory sentence into the receiver: “The factory closes
down tomorrow!” Disregarding the bewildered twittering from
the other end of the line, he hung up and turned a smiling face to
Dr. Ting:

“Where do you suggest I go for my summer holiday, Doctor?
I feel like a breath of sea air!”

$22
“Tsingtao, without a doubt! Or if you'd like to go farther afield,
Chinwangtao is quite pleasant!”

“How about Kuling?”

“Kuling’s all right, but you won’t find your sea air up there!
Besides, I heard a day or so ago that the Red Army is attacking
Chian. Changsha is surrounded, and Nanchang and Kiukiang
are both threatened!—”

“Ha! Ha! Ha! What does it matter? I’ve always wanted to
have a look at this Red Army that everybody’s so afraid of and
see if it’s all it’s made out to be! As likely as not they’ll prove
to be nothing more than bandits! The only reason they’ve got
away with it so long is that nobody’s troubled to do anything
about them! Excuse me a moment, Doctor. If you'll just make
yourself at home I'll go and see to one or two things. Won't
keep you a moment.”

Laughing hilariously, Wu Sun-fu left the study and ran straight
upstairs. Now that he realized it was all over, he was beginning
to feel calm and peaceful once more. He slipped quietly into his
room and found his wife curled up on the sofa under window
with a book.

“Pei-yao! Hurry up and tell the servants to pack! We're leav-
ing tonight for our summer holiday!”

His wife leapt to her feet thunderstruck. The book fell off
her lap on to the floor and a faded white rose fluttered out from
between the pages. This was the third time Wu Sun-fu had seen
the book and the rose, but, as on the other two occasions, he was
foo preoccupied to notice them. Her cheeks flushed, his wife
glanced down at them and said absently:

“That’s rather short notice, isn’t it? Still, anything you say.”

— THE END —
ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Shen Yen-ping, better known by his pen-name Mao Tun, was
porn in 1896 in Tunghsiang in the province of Chekiang. He is
one of the most outstanding exponents of revolutionary realism
to appear in China since the New Literature Movement began
in 1919. In November 1920, together with Cheng Chen-to, Yeh
Sheng-tao and other writers, he founded the “Society for Literary
Studies,” one of the first organizations to be formed in China for
the purpose of fostering new trends in literature. In 1921 he
became editor of the Fiction, a literary monthly published by the
Commercial Press in Shanghai. He completely overhauled this
periodical and through it launched a fierce attack on feudalistic
and compradore influences in current Chinese literature.

From 1926 to 1927 he edited the Minkuojihpao, a Hankow daily
devoted to the cause of the revolution. When Chiang Kai-shek
betrayed the revolution, and the Kuomintang became firmly anti-
Communist, he left Hankow and returned to Shanghai.

In 1927 he began to use the pen-name Mao Tun for his novel-
writing, which served to expose the evils of the reactionary Kuo-
mintang régime and to reflect the revolutionary struggle of the
people. His works of this period comprise the novels The Can-
ker —a_ trilogy — (1927), The Rainbow (1930), “If Three Walk To-
gether .. .” (1931), and Midnight (1933), as well as a number of
short stories, essays, and articles on a variety of subjects.

During the anti-Japanese war (1937-1945) Mao Tun kept up his
literary activities by editing the periodical The Literary Front
and writing the novels Decay (1941) and Frosted Leaves As Red
As Flowers in Spring (1942), the play Before and After the Ching-
ming Festival (1944), besides various short stories, essays and
articles.

In 1949, after the founding of the Chinese People’s Republic,
Mao Tun was made Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation
of Writers and Artists, Chairman of the Chinese Writers’ Union,
and Minister of Culture in the Central People's Government. In
1954 he was elected Deputy to the First National People’s Con-
gress while continuing to hold the portfolio of Minister of Culture.
